          Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific remains resilient, also supported with some recovery
          in the external environment in the second half of 2016 and early 2017                               2
          Exports show early signs of recovery across much of the region                                      8
          Domestic demand across much of the region was buoyant, reflecting accommodative
          macroeconomic policies and tight labor markets                                                    10
          Private sector credit growth is moderating slightly, but debt stocks remain elevated              12
          Inflation is edging up, and producer prices are rising rapidly                                    13
          Renewed capital outflows toward the end of 2016 led to exchange rate depreciations, but
          external financial conditions have stabilized in 2017                                             14
          Recent developments in the Pacific Island Countries                                               22
          Poverty and inclusiveness: sustained progress, but challenges remain                              22
    I.B.	 Outlook and Risks                                                                                  28
          Growth is expected to moderate in China, but pick up slightly in the rest of the region            28
          Poverty will continue to fall across most of the region, reflecting rising labor incomes and low
          unemployment32
          Domestic demand will support growth, with a rising contribution from exports, across much of
          the region                                                                                         33
          The normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies may test the region’s resilience,
          especially in countries with elevated external debt, or high and rising private sector leverage    35
          A sharp slowdown in world trade or in China could significantly affect the region                  43
          Fiscal deficits are expected to remain elevated in several countries, in some cases posing risks to
          fiscal sustainability                                                                              44
          The outlook for the Pacific Island Countries is positive,
          but they remain especially vulnerable to shocks                                                    49
    I.C.	 Policy Considerations                                                               54
          Elevated global policy uncertainty places a large premium on macroeconomic prudence 54
          Ensuring sustained growth and greater inclusion                                     57

             Current approaches and why they are falling short of expectations                                 111
             Toward an effective strategy: Curbing agricultural pollution will require the public sector to set
             priorities, effectively compel and motivate farmers, back innovation and learning, and influence
             the sector’s structure and growth trajectory from farm to table                                   111
             Looking ahead: Tackling East Asia’s agricultural pollution challenge is not only within reach, but

Executive Summary

The global economy has shown signs of dynamism in the six months since the previous East Asia and Pacific
Economic Update. Sustained expansion in the United States, the Euro Area, and Japan has been accompanied
by better-than-expected growth in the United Kingdom and in some emerging market commodity exporters. This
recovery in activity has led to a pickup in global trade and a gradual increase in commodity prices. While policy
uncertainty following the U.S. elections triggered a bout of financial volatility, market conditions stabilized quickly.
Monetary policy has started tightening in the United States, but remains loose in other advanced economies.

Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) continues to be resilient and in line with previous
expectations. Already robust domestic demand has been supported by some pickup in external demand and the
gradual recovery in commodity prices. Fiscal deficits in the major regional economies widened in 2016, prompting
some adjustment toward the end of the year in Indonesia and Malaysia. Monetary policies remained accommodative,
and credit continued to grow rapidly in most major economies. Inflation is edging up and producer prices are
rising quickly as commodity prices increase. Capital outflows intensified toward end-2016 leading to depreciation
pressures, but financial markets have since recovered.

The growth outlook for 2017–19 remains broadly positive across the region. China is expected to continue
its gradual transition to lower, more sustainable growth. In the rest of the region, growth is projected to pick up
moderately. Continued buoyancy in domestic demand, including public and increasingly private investment, will
be supported by gradually strengthening external demand. Global growth and commodity prices are projected
to continue recovering slowly, while global financial conditions tighten gradually. Inflationary pressures should
remain contained.

China’s growth moderation and rebalancing are expected to continue. Growth is projected to continue easing
steadily, to 6.5 percent in 2017 and 6.3 percent in 2018–19. The real estate sector is expected to cool in response
to policy tightening, while exports rise moderately. Productivity-oriented reforms, such as reducing excess capacity
and leverage in the corporate sector, including state-owned enterprises, will gradually advance the rebalancing of
China’s economic structure.

In the other large developing economies in the region, growth is projected to pick up slightly. The
Philippines will benefit from increases in public infrastructure spending, a recent uptick in private investment,
continued credit expansion, and growth in remittances. In Indonesia, growth will rise as commodity prices firm,
and credit growth continues to respond to loose monetary policy. In Malaysia, the moderate recovery reflects
income-support measures, increased infrastructure spending, and rising exports. In Vietnam, activity will increase
as the impact of the 2016 drought dissipates, and in line with favorable market sentiments and continued strong
FDI flows. Thailand is expected to benefit from improved confidence following the royal transition, large public
investment projects, and robust tourism, although continued weak productivity growth will keep growth modest.

The smaller regional economies are generally expected to continue to benefit from rapid growth in their
neighbors and higher commodity prices. Activity will be boosted by fiscal expansion, agricultural reforms, and
continued buoyancy of tourism in Cambodia; increases in the generation and exports of power in Lao PDR; and

rising infrastructure spending and foreign investments in Myanmar. In Mongolia, growth will stagnate in 2017,
partly reflecting efforts to reduce public debt to sustainable levels, but will recover thereafter with macroeconomic
stabilization, structural reforms, and the likely expansion of mining investments. In Papua New Guinea, growth will
gradually recover as several mining and petroleum prospects come on stream. In Timor-Leste, the elections later
this year will slow some public investment projects. Most Pacific Island Countries will benefit from recent trends in
fisheries and tourism, and expanding opportunities for migration and connectivity.

Poverty has continued to decline in most countries and is projected to fall further, consistent with
sustained growth and rising labor incomes. The number of extreme poor has fallen to 2 percent of the region’s
population, although this proportion rises to about 10 percent if the threshold is one of moderate poverty. And,
across much of the region, the bottom 40 percent of the population has enjoyed relatively fast income growth.
Nevertheless, challenges remain. In countries such as Lao PDR and Myanmar, a significant percentage of the
population remains poor. In Mongolia and Papua New Guinea, recent economic setbacks may have reversed
gains. And in many countries the public perception is that inequality is high and rising, with income and wealth
increasingly concentrated at the very top of the distribution, and everyone else facing an uneven playing field.

Nevertheless, global and regional vulnerabilities mean that the positive prospects for the region are
subject to large risks. First, financial sectors in the large regional economies could be tested by external and
domestic shocks. External financial conditions may tighten faster than anticipated, leading to significant capital
outflows and renewed financial volatility. As a result, the servicing and rollover of debt, particularly short-term,
foreign-currency-denominated debt, would become more challenging. Nevertheless, generally robust reserves
provide a cushion against short-term volatility. Domestically, rapid credit growth is raising financial vulnerabilities
among households and corporates, particularly in China, Malaysia, and Thailand. That said, banks in the region
generally remain relatively well capitalized. Second, the region, being extremely open, is particularly vulnerable
to a slowdown in international trade, stemming, for instance, from mounting protectionist pressures. The United
States has withdrawn from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which could cause Vietnam and to a lesser
extent Malaysia to miss out on gains from expanded trade and investment. Antiglobalization sentiment has also
been picking up in some other advanced economies. Finally, fiscal deficits are expected to remain elevated in
several countries, in some cases posing risks to fiscal sustainability.

Elevated global policy uncertainty places a premium on macroeconomic prudence. The risks that the region
continues to face, related to the availability and cost of external financing and to the prospects for global trade growth
and export demand, strengthen the case for a continued focus on addressing key macroeconomic vulnerabilities.
Policy makers should retain their emphasis on maintaining sustainable medium-term fiscal frameworks, standing
ready to adjust accommodative monetary policies, and addressing corporate and financial vulnerabilities.

Across the region’s large economies, mobilizing additional revenues will create space for measures to
support growth and foster inclusion, while ensuring that risks to fiscal sustainability remain low. Given
broadly robust domestic demand and the prospects for a gradual increase in external demand, there is little
rationale for additional fiscal stimulus at this time. In contrast, efforts to broaden the tax base and improve
tax administration can yield significant gains. In China, increasing the clarity of government and state-owned
enterprise (SOE) finances, as well as strengthening fiscal discipline and hardening budget constraints for subnational
governments and public-benefit SOEs, will help moderate growth in public investment and place public finances

on a more sustainable path. A broadening of the tax base, especially at the local level to lower the dependence
of revenues on land sales, and improvements in VAT administration can make room to reform labor taxation and
streamline fees levied on businesses. In Malaysia, there is significant scope to broaden the base for personal
income tax, and to reduce exemptions from the general sales tax. In the Philippines, continued rapid growth will
hinge on how well the government manages the large increase in public expenditure. In Vietnam, there is an
urgent need to strengthen the credibility of the medium-term fiscal framework.

Some smaller commodity-exporting economies need to focus on lowering threats to fiscal solvency. In
Mongolia, fiscal consolidation, including more progressive taxation and greater rationalization and better targeting
of expenditures, remains the main priority as part of stabilization. In Lao PDR, elevated public debt is generating
vulnerability to shocks. Efforts are required to boost declining revenues and contain expenditure. In Myanmar and
Papua New Guinea, limited sources of financing again call for fiscal prudence. In general, while many countries have
announced fiscal consolidation plans, these have been lacking in detail. A focus on implementing a combination
of revenue measures (involving increases in tax rates, adjustments to the generous, untargeted tax exemptions,
a strengthening of property and natural resource taxation, and improved tax administration) and expenditures
measures (targeting both the level and the efficiency of spending) would be appropriate.

Much of the region also may need to adjust accommodative monetary policies. While the increase in
consumer prices has so far proved moderate, the more rapid pickup in producer prices and the projected recovery
in commodity prices suggest that pressures will intensify, albeit from a low base. If external financing conditions
tighten more rapidly than anticipated, this will place regional exchange rates under pressure, and again call for
domestic monetary tightening. Some of the smaller economies are already facing significant pressures, and should
consider a combination of greater exchange rate flexibility and monetary tightening.

In China, reforms of the corporate sector, including restructuring of SOEs, and measures to bring credit
growth under control are critical to reducing vulnerabilities. Reforms to address excess industrial capacity,
including closures of outdated production facilities and strict controls on new projects, have been initiated and
remain key tasks for the authorities. They could be usefully complemented by measures to enhance SOEs’ corporate
governance and efficiency. The rapid expansion of credit increases the risk of disorderly deleveraging. A continued
gradual tightening of financial discipline, and increased tolerance for insolvencies and bankruptcies, remain
appropriate. Strengthening social transfers and active labor market policies will help mitigate any adverse impacts.

Elsewhere in the region, rapid credit growth and sizable external debt could catalyze the buildup and
transmission of risks; improvements in supervision and prudential regulation will be required. Credit
growth remains elevated across much of the region, including Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Myanmar, and
Vietnam. The policy response must involve efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision in line with international
good practice. Arrangements for resolving nonperforming loans also need to be improved. As total debt stocks
continue increasing, macroprudential regulation will prove increasingly important.

Sustaining medium-term growth and promoting inclusion will require efforts across a range of areas.
Several economies have been experiencing trend slowdowns in both productivity and, in particular, investment
growth. While the precise causes differ across countries, the underlying drivers of this trend include weaknesses
in the institutional environment and investment climate, rising private debt burdens, weak growth prospects in

advanced economies, and negative terms-of-trade shocks. Sustaining robust growth over the medium term will
involve addressing a range of bottlenecks so as to increase the impact of public investment on productivity, and
help crowd in both domestic and foreign private investment. This issue of the East Asia and Pacific Economic Update
discusses three broad reform areas: improving the quality of public expenditure, responding to potential global
protectionist pressures through greater regional integration, and dealing with the rising threat of agricultural
pollution.

Across the region, improving the quality of public spending can bring benefits. While all countries can gain, it
is especially critical in economies with limited fiscal space, because it will help ensure that needed fiscal adjustments
do not affect the most vulnerable or the delivery of key public services. In China, current revenue and expenditure
mismatches at the local level result in wide disparities in welfare expenditure and social service provision. Lower
infrastructure spending, combined with a reallocation of funds from distortionary agricultural support programs,
can help free up resources. If combined with complementary sectoral reforms, these resources can help finance
a consolidated, streamlined social protection system, more equitable educational spending, and improved access
to health services for the poor. In Indonesia, more efficient spending on education and agriculture will allow for a
reallocation toward underfunded programs with greater development impact, including infrastructure, health, and
social assistance. In Malaysia, priorities include improving the targeting of social protection, maintaining support
for infrastructure development, and increasing the quality of education to address skills constraints. In Myanmar,
limited fiscal space must be refocused toward capital expenditure, including on critical energy and transport
infrastructure, and toward currently underfunded social protection. Across the region, both urban and rural poor
remain vulnerable to higher food prices. Boosting agricultural productivity and enhancing logistics (including
through improvements in irrigation and transport infrastructure, more effective agricultural research, stronger
land titling, and greater competition) will require both policy and expenditure reforms geared to ensuring better
value for money. Together, these measures can help reduce food prices and boost the incomes of the poor.

Developing EAP could benefit significantly from further deepening regional integration, especially in
services trade, which remains subject to significant restrictions. Several initiatives, including the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the evolving ASEAN Economic Community, and the various ASEAN+3
initiatives, provide an opportunity to advance regional integration. Such agreements will provide greater benefits
to the region if they cover all trade, in both goods and services, do not discriminate against nonmembers, and
feature functioning dispute resolution mechanisms. Lowering barriers to labor mobility within ASEAN could yield
significant gains, including by reinforcing the impact of measures to liberalize trade and investment. Specific
policy priorities for labor-sending and labor-receiving countries include strengthening regulation of international
recruitment agencies, and providing comparable protection to migrant and local workers; introducing mutual
recognition of qualifications, and increasing the portability of social protection benefits; and adjusting quantity
restrictions on migration regularly, based on economic needs.

The agricultural sector’s increasingly adverse environmental footprint needs attention across the region.
Agricultural activities are affecting soil and water quality in many countries, with increasingly serious consequences
for human health and biodiversity, and increasingly the productivity of agriculture itself. This particularly threatens
the poor, whose livelihoods are especially dependent on natural resources, and who lack the means to cope
with environmental shocks. So far, policy responses have typically occurred late, lacked the required scale, and
ultimately failed to tackle distorted incentives. Indeed, agricultural pollution is often encouraged by current public

expenditure programs, including subsidies and regulations favoring the livestock industry, and direct or indirect
fertilizer subsidies. Looking ahead, agricultural agencies must increasingly focus on health and environmental
outcomes, including by giving greater weight to resource conservation, and redefining food security in terms of
micronutrient content and diversity as well as caloric and protein availability. Similarly, health and environmental
agencies must bring agriculture more fully into their fold, to help curb the rise of chronic disease.

In the Pacific Island Countries, maintaining fiscal sustainability needs to remain a focus along with
policy reforms in selected sectors, which could prove transformational over the medium term. For fiscal
sustainability, efforts to shore up revenues, contain unproductive spending while boosting critical expenditures
on health and education, and build up buffers against shocks need to be sustained. There are also opportunities
to accelerate growth and boost employment over the longer term. On tourism, promising options include tapping
into the Chinese and retiree market, increasing the number of luxury resorts, and encouraging cruise ships to
base in the Pacific. Increases in labor mobility, through the expansion of existing agreements and the negotiation
of new agreements, complemented by investments in workers’ human capital, could also generate substantial
benefits. Higher mobile and internet penetration, complemented by a conducive business environment and the
development of a skilled workforce could boost productivity. And income from fisheries could be significantly
increased, without threatening the sustainability of the fisheries stock, by broadening participation in cooperative
agreements to include East Asian countries with major fishing grounds, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, and
ensuring compliance with robust catch limits.

I.A.	 Recent Developments
        Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific continues to be resilient and in line with previous expectations.
        Already robust domestic demand has been supported by some pickup in external demand, and a gradual
        recovery in commodity prices. In China, growth moderated slightly, but with some strengthening toward
        the end of 2016. The other large economies, including, in particular, the Philippines and Vietnam,
        generally solidified their performance in the second half of 2016 and the start of 2017. Among the smaller
        economies, performance has been more mixed: Cambodia continued to grow rapidly, while Mongolia
        and Papua New Guinea slowed sharply. Fiscal deficits in the major regional economies widened in 2016,
        prompting some adjustment toward the end of the year in Indonesia and Malaysia. Monetary policies
        remained accommodative, and credit continued to grow rapidly in most major economies. Inflation
        is edging up and producer prices are rising rapidly as commodity prices increase. Capital outflows
        intensified toward end-2016, leading to depreciation pressures, but external financial conditions have
        stabilized in 2017. Poverty rates have continued to decline, driven by rapid growth in labor incomes, and
        across much of the region the bottom 40 percent of the population has enjoyed relatively fast income
        growth. Despite this, in many countries the public perception is that inequality is high and rising.




Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific remains resilient, also supported
with some recovery in the external environment in the second half of 2016
and early 2017

The global economy showed signs of dynamism in the second half of 2016, which have been sustained in
early 2017   (Box I.A.1). Global growth accelerated to 2.5 percent and industrial production rose by 4.8 percent
in Q4 2016; the global composite Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) continues to rise. The sustained, albeit
relatively slow, expansion in the United States, the Euro Area, and Japan has been accompanied by better-than-
expected growth in the United Kingdom and in some emerging market commodity exporters, including Brazil and
the Russian Federation. This recovery in activity has led to a pickup in global trade: while growth in global goods
trade fell to a postcrisis low of 1.2 percent for 2016 as a whole, trade flows strengthened in the second half of the
year, with the trend continuing into 2017. Commodity prices, after stabilizing in the first half of 2016, gradually
recovered, benefiting commodity exporters; that said, commodity prices remain low by historical standards.

External financial conditions were more volatile, but have recently stabilized. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in
widely anticipated moves, raised interest rates by 25 basis points in December 2016, and again in March 2017.
In addition, U.S. long-term interest rates rose sharply following the U.S. elections, reflecting market expectations
of strengthening activity. In response, markets in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) reacted
nervously, with capital flowing out, especially from China, and significant currency volatility. However, other
advanced economies’ central banks maintained loose monetary conditions. Financial flows have steadied since.
Emerging market bond spreads have narrowed since November 2016, and currencies have recovered. Capital
inflows have resumed, with EMDE bond issuance activity starting 2017 at a record pace.

    Box I.A.1. Recent Global Developments

    The global economy is recovering following its weakest postcrisis performance in 2016. Global growth
    is estimated to have fallen to 2.3 percent in 2016, amid stalling global goods trade, weak investment,
    and heightened policy uncertainties (Figure BI.A.1.1). However, growth appears to have accelerated in the
    second half of the year. Activity continued to firm in the first months of 2017, with the global composite
    Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) reaching a multiyear high in early 2017, reflecting particularly strong
    performance in the United States, China, and Russia (Figure BI.A.1.2).

    Growth in advanced economies is strengthening. In the United States, growth rose to near 2 percent
    in Q4 2016. Domestic demand was sustained amid increased confidence and stabilization of investment.
    In the Euro Area, growth strengthened at the start of 2017. Manufacturing activity and goods exports
    have been buoyed by strengthening internal and external demand. In Japan, recent data suggest growth
    stabilizing around 1 percent. Exports have started to pick up, labor markets are tight, but consumption
    remains subdued due to weak wage growth.

     Activity in Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is accelerating, following an
     estimated 3.4 percent growth in 2016. A modest increase in commodity prices and improved confidence
     underpin a recovery in commodity exporters following two consecutive years of anemic growth (Figure
     BI.A.1.3). Recent industrial production, PMI, and trade data all point to tentative signals of a solid rebound
     in economic activity in EMDEs (Figure BI.A.1.4). Median Consumer Price Index inflation is picking up as
     rising inflation in commodity importers offsets easing price pressures in commodity exporters. Adopting a
     longer perspective, developing countries in East Asia and Pacific and in South Asia continue to prove their
     resilience—their real GDP is now well above precrisis levels (Figure BI.A.1.5).

     Global trade is showing growing momentum. Global goods trade growth fell to a postcrisis low of
     1.2 percent in 2016 as a whole (Figure BI.A.1.6). Services trade was more resilient throughout 2016,
     supported by the relative strength of global consumer spending. Trade growth began to strengthen in the
     second half of the year, however, expanding by 2.3 percent in Q3 (q/q SAAR) and an estimated 4.6 percent
     in Q4. The positive momentum appears to have continued in 2017, as export orders reached their highest
     levels in nearly six years in January. Protectionist pressures have increased, but are unlikely to have been
     the key factor behind recent weakness in global trade. The rate at which new trade-restrictive measures are
     imposed has not increased significantly above the post-2009 average, although there is some evidence that
     it is higher than in the period before the global financial crisis, and new trade-facilitating measures are
     being introduced at a slower rate (WTO 2016).

     Commodity prices are continuing to recover slowly. Prices of most commodities continued to rise in
     January 2017 from their lows in early 2016 (Figure BI.A.1.7). The recent uptick in oil prices has been
     supported by the agreement between some OPEC and non-OPEC producers to limit output during the first
     half of this year.

     Global financing conditions tightened at end-2016, but have since stabilized. U.S. long-term interest
     rates rose sharply following the U.S. elections in early November 2016, but have plateaued in recent weeks.
     In both the Euro Area and Japan, policy rates remain at historic lows, and central banks remain committed

      to quantitative easing—Japan’s “yield curve control” program aims to stabilize the 10-year government
      bond yield at zero percent. However, in some Euro Area countries, the combination of rising inflation, rising
      risk premia from upcoming political events, and renewed banking sector concerns have driven up long-term
      yields.

      EMDE financial markets have performed well recently. The markets rebounded in early 2017 after a
      turbulent spell in late 2016. Capital inflows to EMDE bond and equity mutual funds have resumed after
      sharp outflows in late 2016. EMDE equities recently surpassed 2016 highs, reflecting some unwinding
      of U.S. dollar appreciation, stabilization of U.S. bond yields, and a pickup in commodity prices (Figure
      BI.A.1.8). And emerging market sovereign bond spreads have tightened since their most recent high in mid-
      November, to levels last seen in late 2014.

Myanmar saw a slowdown. Overall, developing EAP accounted for around 40 percent of global growth in 2016.
Adopting a longer perspective, growth in the region has been particularly resilient: since 2007, regional output
has increased by 90 percent, more than in any other region. Furthermore, developing EAP maintains its long track
record of remarkable success in reducing poverty, driven largely by continued increases in labor incomes (Box
I.A.2).

In addition to China, the other large economies also generally solidified their performance in the second
half of 2016 and the start of 2017. In Vietnam, GDP growth picked up by more than 1 percentage point in
the second half of 2016, to reach 6.7 percent (year-over-year) in Q4 2016 (Figure I.A.2). Manufacturing exports
expanded, and the impact of the drought at the start of the year dissipated. In the Philippines, after six quarters
of acceleration, GDP growth rate moderated to a still very high 6.6 percent in Q4 2016. Higher public capital
spending crowded in private investments; robust remittances, credit growth, and low inflation supported private
consumption; and electronic exports proved buoyant. On the production side, both industry and services recorded
strong growth, while systemic issues continue to weigh on agricultural performance. In Indonesia, growth weakened
slightly in the second half of the year to around 5 percent, as efforts to meet the deficit target led to a scaling
back of government consumption. In Malaysia, GDP growth held up as rising minimum wages and civil servants’
salaries supported private consumption, improving prospects for commodities strengthened business sentiments
and investments, and a diversified export base helped the country benefit from the pickup in global trade. In
Thailand, growth accelerated in the first half of 2016 but slowed slightly in the second half, as the mourning period
for the late king weighed on domestic demand. The manufacturing PMI has been broadly consistent with these
trends, pointing to robust expansion in the Philippines, continued confidence in China and Vietnam, lackluster
performance in Indonesia, a bottoming-out in Malaysia, and modest expansion in Thailand (Figure I.A.3).

Among the smaller economies, performance has been more mixed. The recovery in commodity prices provided
opportunities for commodity exporters. However, in some of these countries, fiscal challenges constrained public
spending, and natural resource sectors continued to be affected by difficulties including resource depletion. In
Myanmar, growth slowed to 6.5 percent, as flooding took a toll on agriculture, gas production declined, and
domestic demand was affected by uncertainty regarding the new administration’s policies and by currency volatility.

    Box I.A.2. Poverty in Developing East Asia and Pacific

    Developing EAP maintains its record of successful poverty reduction. In 2016, the share of the region’s
    population living in extreme poverty (below the international poverty line of US$1.90 a day in 2011
    purchasing power parity [PPP] terms) is estimated to have decreased to 2.0 percent, or excluding China, to
    4.6 percent (Figure BI.A.2.1). The share of the region’s population living in moderate poverty (below the
    US$3.10-a-day line in 2011 PPP terms) also fell, from 14 percent in 2014 to less than 11 percent in 2016.
    Poverty has recently started declining also in the Philippines, after a decade of relatively slow progress.

     Note: The most recent household survey used for actual estimates vary from 2006 in Kiribati to 2015 in Indonesia and the Philippines. Estimates prior to 2015 are: (i) derived directly from household
     survey data; (ii) China 2013 is a survey break and data are not comparable with previous years (iii) interpolated between existing surveys; or (iv) extrapolated based on per-capita GDP growth and historical
     estimates of the growth elasticity of poverty (GEP), but China, Papua New Guinea and Pacific Island countries based on neutral growth distribution. For 2016 onwards, estimates are projected based on
     projected per-capita GDP growth and the GEP, and are hence preliminary and subject to revision.
     
     In China, data through 2012 are not comparable with those for subsequent years, owing to a change in the survey methodology which acted to lower reported poverty, and may account for nearly half
     of the reported decrease in the poverty headcount between 2012 and 2013. In late 2012, separate urban and rural household surveys were replaced with a single national household survey, which uses
     stratified, multi-stage sampling methods. There were significant changes in the collection of information from migrants (now treated as part of the urban population when measuring aggregate disposable
     income), and the treatment of net taxes and transfers in rural areas; and rents from home ownership are now imputed. This latter factor in particular may have had a substantial effect on reported poverty.




In Mongolia, output is estimated to have expanded by 1.0 percent in 2016 (almost a full percentage point above
earlier expectations), largely as a result of a Q4 2016 recovery in mining output and exports. Still, macroeconomic
imbalances remain significant and the authorities have recently reached a tentative agreement with development
partners on a program of fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms to be supported by a substantial external financing
package. In Papua New Guinea, output growth moderated, reflecting partly the maturing of the liquefied natural
gas (LNG) sector (a large project came on stream in 2015), but also a halt in production at two mines, as well as
cash shortages affecting government spending. In Timor-Leste, nonoil output expanded at a faster pace in 2016,
benefiting from higher government spending, improved agriculture outturns, and some growth in tourism, albeit
from a low base. However, oil production continues to decline as existing oil fields are depleted. In Lao PDR, growth
remained high, driven by continued expansion of the power sector. However, it fell below historical averages, as
the continuation of the moratorium on mining licenses led to flat mining output, and fiscal difficulties limited
the government’s contribution to economic activity. Among small commodity importers, Cambodia continued
to expand rapidly, as agriculture recovered from the drought in the previous year, and FDI and garment exports
remained resilient. In contrast, GDP growth in Fiji declined to 2 percent as cyclone Winston affected key sectors,
including agriculture and tourism.

Exports show early signs of recovery across much of the region

The gradual strengthening of global economic activity led to a slight pickup in regional exports, although
domestic demand continues to drive growth. In China, the contribution of net exports to growth turned negative
in the first half of 2016, but has since been trending up (Figure I.A.4). In the Philippines, in the second half of the
year, exports held up while import growth moderated (Figure I.A.5). In Thailand, net exports contributed positively
to growth in 2016, although import growth has been gradually recovering. In Indonesia, net exports’ contribution
to growth declined in the first three quarters of 2016; however, in the last quarter, exports grew for the first time in
over two years. In Malaysia, net export demand added around 0.5 percentage points to GDP growth in the second
half of the year, more than at any time over the preceding two years. Across the smaller economies, net export
demand contributed to growth in Cambodia and Lao PDR, as exports increased while imports remained contained
in Papua New Guinea, as well.

Growth in both export volumes and values has been gradually recovering, following a disappointing
performance in 2015 and the first half of 2016. The export recovery has been largely in line with projections,
reflecting firming activity in high-income economies and in large EMDEs. In China, export volumes for goods

is providing an additional boost to exports. In the Philippines, export growth remains strong, buoyed by electronics,
including semiconductors. In Thailand, the export stagnation eased in late 2016, but performance remains weak,
reflecting ongoing competitiveness challenges. Export volumes from Cambodia are strengthening as garment
exports continue to rise; however, export values eased, as depreciating currencies among the main competitors
pushed export prices down. In Lao PDR, exports have been rebounding in 2016, reflecting the coming on stream
of new capacity in the power sector, recent success in attracting export-oriented FDI in manufacturing of parts
and components, and the recovery in copper prices. In Myanmar, exports contracted due to lower gas production
and the impact of the floods. Export volumes declined in Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste owing to reductions
in copper and oil production, respectively. However, Mongolian commodity exports benefited from expanded
production at one large copper mine, and continued weakness in China’s coal sector.

Domestic demand across much of the region was buoyant, reflecting accommodative
macroeconomic policies and tight labor markets

Private consumption in the large economies remained buoyant throughout 2016 and in early 2017.
Consumption growth accelerated in the Philippines and remained rapid in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In
China, combined private and public consumption1 contributed around 5 percentage points to growth in 2016, almost
a full percentage point more than the 2013–15 average (Figure I.A.4). Labor markets are tight across most of these
countries: China created a record 13.1 million jobs in 2016, and unemployment has been declining in Indonesia
and the Philippines. Further boosts in purchasing power came, in Malaysia, from the hike in the minimum wage
and civil servants’ salaries; in the Philippines, from the expansion in social protection and conditional cash transfer
program, and from robust remittances. In contrast, in Thailand, private consumption enjoyed some recovery at the
start of 2016 but subsequently slowed, while public consumption grew toward the end of the year but at a modest
pace. In Mongolia, macroeconomic uncertainty and the partial reversal of expansionary measures limited demand.

Investment broadly continued to hold up, supported by stabilizing public capital expenditure and
improved business sentiment. Over the past few years, developing EAP has been spared the relatively sharp
fall in investment growth experienced by other regions (Box I.C.3). And, more recently, regional investment is
showing signs of a modest recovery, although private investment in particular remains sluggish in a few countries,
most notably Thailand and, until recently, Indonesia. In China, infrastructure spending accelerated in the second
half of the year; the contribution of investment to growth rose to 2.8 percentage points of GDP in the last
quarter, still below the 2013–15 average. In the Philippines, investment growth remains robust, reflecting a
strong public infrastructure push (Figure I.A.8) and an
upbeat private sector. In Vietnam, investment growth       Figure I.A.8. Government capital expenditure is

Fiscal deficits in the major regional economies widened in 2016, prompting some adjustment toward

deficit increased from 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015 to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2016, largely the result of increased
capital expenditure on roads, education, and health. Deficits widened in Thailand as well, also reflecting subdued
revenue collection, and in Vietnam. In Indonesia, the widening deficit triggered a sharp adjustment in Q4 2016,
containing the 2016 deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP, slightly below the 2015 level. Similarly, in Malaysia, the deficit
widened in the first half of 2016, but subsequently narrowed as current nonsalary expenditures were tightened,
and revenues were boosted by the improved collection of general sales tax and dividend payment from the national
oil company.

There are large, rising deficits across the smaller economies. In Mongolia, in particular, the deficit more than
doubled in 2016, reflecting both large election-related expenditures on policy lending and other programs, and
weak revenues (Figure I.A.10). In Lao PDR, despite some recovery in revenues in the second half of 2016, the fiscal
position for the year deteriorated significantly, as natural resource revenues declined. Resource revenues have
fallen and deficits increased in Myanmar and Papua New Guinea as well. In Timor-Leste, a large structural deficit
has opened up, as the impact of declining petroleum production has been compounded by low world energy prices.
The deficit increased, to a lesser degree, in Cambodia, caused mainly by a rising wage bill.

Monetary conditions in many countries remain accommodative, supported by still relatively benign
inflationary conditions. China began to gradually tighten monetary policy in early 2017 to moderate credit
growth and cool property markets, although monetary conditions remain accommodative. In Vietnam, there were
no changes in the main monetary policy instruments, but significant unsterilized foreign exchange purchases
drove interbank rates below 1 percent toward the end of the year, subsequently prompting some efforts to tighten
liquidity. Malaysia ended the easing cycle in July 2016, including due to the increased volatility of the exchange
rate in the second half of the year. In the Philippines, following rate cuts in Q2 2016, the benchmark interest rate
remained unchanged. Indonesia, however, lowered policy rates by 25 basis points in October 2016, as inflationary
pressures remained low, credit growth was modest, and reserve cover improved (Figure I.A.11). And, in Thailand,
the policy rate remained at 1.5 percent as the authorities tried to support the sluggish economy. Among the

smaller economies, Lao PDR further lowered the inflation-linked interest rate caps on kip deposits and loans in
August 2016, and Cambodia recently introduced interest rate caps for microfinance. Mongolia, facing significant
pressures on the exchange rate, sharply tightened monetary policy in August 2016, and only partly reversed the
tightening later in the year. With inflation picking up slightly, real interest rates have been declining, and in some
cases are close to zero or even negative. In most countries, they remain significantly below their long-term average

Private sector credit growth is moderating slightly, but debt stocks remain elevated

Following several years of rapid expansion, real credit growth has moderated over the past year, but
remains rapid. Since 2010, credit growth has been relatively high across most large regional economies, but
particularly so in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, and more recently in Vietnam (Figure I.A.13). In
China, continued robust real credit growth in the second half of 2016 prompted a tightening of monetary policy
in early 2017, in an effort to lower risks in the financial sector. Despite this, credit growth remains strong. Growth
in real credit appears to have moderated in Vietnam and stabilized in the Philippines. Still, in both countries,
the pace of credit expansion remains high, at well above 10 percent year-over-year. In contrast, mixed business
sentiment in Indonesia, and lackluster economic performance and high debt in Thailand, kept real credit growth
below 5 percent, despite cuts in policy rates in the former and a prolonged period of low rates in the latter. Real
credit growth remains below 5 percent in Malaysia, as well. Credit growth has been especially rapid in some smaller
economies in recent years; however, there, too, credit expansion appears to be moderating. In Cambodia, the
real growth rate of domestic credit declined to around 17 percent, from around 20 percent at the start of 2016.
Similarly, a small deceleration was recorded in Lao PDR to 15 percent. In contrast, real credit growth accelerated
in Myanmar to around 25 percent by the end of 2016.

The stock of private sector debt remains elevated in several economies. The total debt stock exceeds 250 percent
of GDP in China, and 150 percent of GDP in Malaysia and Thailand (Figure I.A.14). In China, nonfinancial corporate
debt has grown particularly rapidly, to over 160 percent of GDP; a large share of this is concentrated in infrastructure
and real estate. In Malaysia and Thailand, household debt exceeds 70 percent of GDP.




Inflation is edging up, and producer prices are rising rapidly

Inflation has been increasing across much of the region in response to robust domestic demand and
recovering commodity prices, but remains below historical values. Inflation remains stable in China. However,
in Vietnam, consumer prices rose relatively quickly in recent months, including owing to hikes in administrative
prices (Figure I.A.15). Consumer price inflation has also been steadily accelerating in the Philippines (to 3.3 percent
in February 2017) and more recently Indonesia (to 3.8 percent in February 2017). In Thailand, inflation increased
to 1.1 percent in early 2017, reflecting higher food and fuel prices. Similarly, inflation is increasing among the
smaller economies. It accelerated rapidly in Myanmar, also reflecting the currency depreciation, and edged upward
in Cambodia and Lao PDR, reflecting increases in food prices and, in Lao PDR, also fuel prices. In Mongolia,
inflation dropped sharply during 2016, but has been increasing more recently. In general, available measures of
core inflation remain more muted (Figure I.A.16).

Producer prices have been increasing rapidly in some countries, reflecting rising commodity and materials
prices and reduced excess capacity (   Figure I.A.17). Producer prices across much of the region fell during most
of 2015–16. However, producer price inflation has now reached around 10 percent in Indonesia and Malaysia,
7 percent in China, 6 percent in the Philippines, and 4 percent in Thailand; producer prices also stopped falling in
Vietnam in early 2017.

Renewed capital outflows toward the end of 2016 led to exchange rate depreciations,
but external financial conditions have stabilized in 2017

Capital flows proved volatile in the aftermath of the U.S. elections and the increase in U.S. policy rates.
During 2016, China again saw large capital outflows, reflecting uncertainty and the growing role of Chinese

(Box I.A.3). Outflows intensified at end-2016 but may have moderated slightly since the start of 2017. Similarly,
capital outflows intensified in Malaysia and Thailand, and to a lesser extent the Philippines, in the second half
of 2016 (Figure I.A.18). In contrast, capital inflows appear to have held up in Indonesia, as residents repatriated
foreign assets owing to the tax amnesty, and in Vietnam. Portfolio flows exhibited roughly similar trends.

declining trend by mid-2016, peaked temporarily in November 2016. However, they have since declined and
are below their longer-term average levels (Figure I.A.23). Similarly, local-currency government bond yields are
significantly below their end-2015 values in Indonesia and Vietnam, reflecting continued capital inflows, although
they are somewhat higher in China and the Philippines (Figure I.A.24).

Exchange rates also depreciated in late 2016, again with some recovery since. Dollar exchange rates
depreciated across much of the region in the second half of 2016 (Figure I.A.25). China, Indonesia, the Philippines,
and Malaysia were significantly affected, reflecting their exposure to global trade prospects and to capital flows. In
response, Malaysia tightened currency regulations.2 Vietnam experienced depreciation despite a trade surplus and
strong FDI inflows, as the authorities built up reserves. Mongolia and Myanmar saw the sharpest depreciations, as

          to deepen onshore financial markets to ensure liquidity in domestic financial markets. The Central Bank has been proactively communicating these measures to investors and market
          players.

sluggish commodity prices and lowered FDI prospects weighed on their external position. Still, several countries,
including China and Indonesia, saw some appreciation against the U.S. dollar in early 2017. In trade-weighted
(nominal and real) terms, both China and the Philippines have depreciated sharply since end-2015, but Indonesia
and Thailand have appreciated (Figure I.A.26), in line with capital flows. Countries with more rigid exchange rate
arrangements, usually de jure or de facto pegs again the U.S. dollar (including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Fiji, Papua
New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga), saw trade-weighted appreciation. In some cases, including Lao PDR and Papua
New Guinea, significant pressures emerged on foreign exchange reserves.

   Capital flows to developing EAP have in general decreased and become more volatile since 2013,
   reflecting changing external and domestic conditions. Major external factors included monetary policy
   normalization in the United States, the sharp decline and current recovery of commodity prices, heightened
   political uncertainty in major economies, and elevated geopolitical tensions. Key domestic factors included
   the slowdown in regional growth, including, in particular, in China, against the backdrop of sizable domestic
   vulnerabilities; the pace of exchange rate and capital account liberalization in China; accommodative monetary
   policies in the majority of regional emerging markets; and episodes of political and policy uncertainty in
                                                                                                  several major economies. In general, developing EAP

   The external financial conditions facing developing EAP improved in early 2017, following turbulence
   in late 2016. The region continued experiencing net capital outflows in 2016, driven by sharp outflows
   from China, Malaysia, Thailand, and to a lesser extent, the Philippines (Figure BI.A.3.2, panels A and B).
   Net outflows intensified in Q4 2016, as the U.S. presidential election, and the expectation of a faster pace
   of monetary policy normalization by the U.S. Federal Reserve, affected investors and led to renewed global
   financial volatility. Since the start of 2017, as the U.S. dollar appreciation was partially unwound and U.S.
   bond yields stabilized, capital flows into regional bonds and equities have resumed.2 Regional stock prices
   recently surpassed 2016 highs, and sovereign bond spreads have tightened since their most recent mid-
   November 2016 high. Currencies and assets in commodity-exporting Indonesia and Malaysia have benefited
   from the continued recovery in commodity prices.

    The composition of capital outflows has changed significantly over time. In 2015, repayment of
    corporate external debt accounted for a large share of outflows. In 2016, this was no longer a key driver of
    capital outflows; indeed, external debt has increased since Q2 2016 (Figure BI.A.3.4). Conversely, in 2016
    outbound FDI exceeded inward FDI for the first time (Figure BI.A.3.5). Outward FDI has nearly tripled since
    2013, boosted by the government’s “going out” strategy. At the same time, inward FDI has declined sharply,
    including through a reduction in reinvested profits, reflecting weaker investment returns and concerns about
    currency depreciation. Relatedly, overseas bank lending, including trade credits, has surged since Q2, partly

             may reflect valuation effects due to changes in exchange rates and interest rates, and possible currency swap transactions between the central bank and domestic banks.

  The authorities accelerated their intervention in foreign exchange markets to curb intensified
  downward pressure on the renminbi. Gross foreign exchange reserves fell sharply in the second half of
  2016, although at a slower pace than in 2015. Reflecting these interventions, in the second half of 2016 the
  renminbi remained broadly stable against the target currency basket, although it depreciated by 4.3 percent
  against the U.S. dollar.

  Capital controls were tightened toward end-2016, in response to the large capital outflows. New
  restrictions were imposed on outward investment and overseas acquisition, reversing the easing measures
  introduced in previous years.4 As a result, outward FDI eased in Q4 2016, and there were net FDI inflows in
  December 2016 and January 2017, after eight consecutive months of net outflows. Since early 2017, overall
  capital inflows have also increased.5 Nevertheless, the long-term effect of such controls remains unclear,
  as uncertainty about instability in capital account regulations and their enforcement has arguably been an
  important motivation for capital outflows. In addition, a tightening of restrictions usually fails to reduce net
  outflows as it provokes a sizable decline in gross inflows from foreign investors (Long 2017; Ma et al. 2016;
  Saborowski et al., 2014).




  4	      Individuals are now required to provide more stringent reporting on the intended purpose of demanded foreign currency not used for capital account transactions. Regulators
          have also increased scrutiny of foreign firms repatriating profits out of China.
  5	      Gross foreign exchange reserves rose by US$6.9 billion in February 2017, the first increase since June 2016. The increase, net of valuation effects, was estimated at US$23.3
          billion. Given a weaker trade balance, this implies lower capital outflows.

    Indonesia continued to benefit from net capital inflows in 2016, notwithstanding a brief reversal
    toward end-2016. Indonesia has in general enjoyed sizable net capital inflows since 2010 (Figure BI.A.3.6,
    panel A). FDI accounted for about half of total capital inflows; portfolio inflows, in particular, to local
    currency government bonds, have also been sizable. During most of 2016, macroeconomic stability was
    reflected in continued capital inflows. FDI and portfolio inflows by nonresidents decreased in the second
    half of the year; in particular, after the U.S. election in November, portfolio investment turned negative.
    However, this was partly offset by residents reducing foreign assets holdings and repatriating funds as a
    result of the tax amnesty (IMF 2017; Tiftik and Farmham 2017).

    In Malaysia, net capital outflows in Q4 2016 were driven by portfolio outflows by nonresidents.
    Conversely, FDI inflows increased, channeled largely into the manufacturing sector, particularly the electrical
    & electronic and petrochemical industries, and into services, including finance and insurance. Outward FDI
    also increased, mainly in mining, telecommunication, and wholesale and retail trade.

    Thailand continued to witness significant capital outflows in 2016         (Figure BI.A.3.6, panel B). FDI
    inflows remained subdued, given policy uncertainty and potential changes to investment promotion regimes.
    Resident capital outflows increased, largely accounted for by outward FDI, and reflecting policy measures to
    liberalize outflows and diversify investment opportunities.6 Thai asset markets were generally less affected
    by global turbulence than regional peers.

Recent developments in the Pacific Island Countries

Most small Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are experiencing moderate to strong growth, driven by stimulus
from public and donor-funded investments, reconstruction from recent natural disasters, and relatively
strong tourism receipts and remittances. In Tonga, growth benefited from improved weather and from
construction for the South Pacific Games. In Samoa, growth accelerated, also due to the start of operations of a
new fish processing plant. Reconstruction spending following Cyclone Pam boosted economic activity in Tuvalu and
Vanuatu, with the upgrade of the airport runway in Vanuatu providing additional tourism opportunities. Improved
weather, stronger tourism, and remittances supported growth in the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, and
the Marshall Islands. In Nauru, the Australian Regional Processing Center, together with construction activities
related to the upgrading of the port, continues to support demand. Growth stagnated in Palau, also reflecting a
government decision to limit the number of charter flights on the islands to reduce pressure on the infrastructure.

Regional fisheries continue to boost public finances in many PICs. Record tuna catches, and the introduction
of the “vessel-day scheme” (a regional agreement that establishes the minimum price of a vessel day and limits
the total number of vessel days sold) continued to deliver large budget windfalls in Kiribati, the Marshall Islands,
the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, and Tuvalu. Several of these countries placed part of the surpluses
into sovereign wealth funds, to finance the budget in future years. In Samoa, fiscal consolidation accelerated,
as domestic revenues increased and expenditure was contained, in part due to the winding down of cyclone
reconstruction efforts. In contrast, the budget deficit further increased in Fiji in 2016, with the cyclone recovery
program expected to add around 2.1 percentage points of GDP to spending. Similarly, the deficit is estimated
to have increased in Tonga, where lower-than-expected development grants, and higher spending on cyclone
reconstruction and wages, more than offset robust revenues. In Vanuatu, a large budget deficit is expected in
2016, reflecting the start of a number of reconstruction projects.




Poverty and inclusiveness: sustained progress, but challenges remain

Poverty rates have continued to decline in most countries, and are also now falling in the Philippines. In
general, sustained reductions in poverty rely on rapid growth in labor incomes among the poor, although public
transfers can also make a significant contribution (Box I.A.4). In Indonesia, continued reductions in poverty reflect
sustained economic growth and low unemployment. In Cambodia and Vietnam, reductions in poverty largely reflect
a structural transformation, with robust growth of employment in secondary and tertiary sectors compensating for
stagnant incomes in agriculture. In China, while growth slowed in 2016, the economy created more jobs than in
previous years. Further declines in unemployment were recorded in Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Solomon
Islands. Livelihoods also benefited from higher public transfers (in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines), and
from public investment focused on lagging regions and critical services (in Malaysia, Thailand, and the PICs).
In contrast, in Mongolia, weak growth is having a disproportionate impact in labor-intensive sectors, including
manufacturing and services. Similarly, in Papua New Guinea, the sharp growth slowdown resulted in a contraction
of employment in nonresource sectors.

decrease in several countries, including the Philippines. In China, there is a growing consensus that inequality
has either leveled off or declined in recent years, after growing rapidly for several decades.3 Despite this, in
many countries the public perception is that inequality is high and rising, with income and wealth increasingly
concentrated at the very top of the distribution, and everyone else facing an uneven playing field.

  Box I.A.4. Poverty and Jobs in East Asia1

  Over the last two decades, poverty has decreased dramatically across most of developing East
  Asia. Between 1990 and 2013, the number of people in the region living in extreme poverty fell by over
  920 million. Over that period, many countries have enjoyed rapid economic growth, supported by increases
  in agricultural productivity, structural transformation, growth in exports, increasing integration into global
  value chains, and a generally favorable business environment.2 These macroeconomic trends correlate at the
  microeconomic level with increased economic opportunities for households.

  At the household level, two main factors explain changes in living standards: labor and nonlabor
  incomes. Labor incomes depend on the number of household members that are able to work, the number
  that actually work, and the incomes they earn from that work. The number of members that can potentially
  work in a household depends on type of family and the life-cycle stage of its members; the larger the share
  of able-bodied adults, the larger the household’s potential labor income. However, potential workers earn
  labor incomes for the family only if they actually have a job. And the magnitude of these labor incomes
  depends on how much they earn (be it in salary work, farming, or their own business) for their hours of work.
  In contrast, nonlabor incomes do not involve current labor market participation. Examples include public
  transfers, such as pensions, cash transfers, unemployment insurance, and other forms of social security and
  social assistance; rents from real estate; and interest and dividends received from ownership of financial
  assets.

  The relative importance of each of the above factors for recent poverty reduction is analyzed across
  a sample of developing EAP countries. Countries are chosen based on data availability. The surveys
  used cover the Philippines during 2009–15, Thailand during 2007–13, and Mongolia and Vietnam during
  2010–14.3 These surveys contain information on individual wages and employment, as well as other sources
  of income such as farming, returns to financial and real estate assets, and public transfers.

  Poverty rates declined over time in all the countries under study. Poverty is defined as household
  income per capita falling below the global poverty line of US$3.10-a-day at 2011 purchasing power parity
  (PPP) prices.4 In general, reported poverty levels are lower using this global poverty line than the official
  national poverty lines (put differently, the global poverty line is lower than the national poverty lines), with
  the exception of the Philippines. However, the direction of changes over time is the same regardless of
  the specific poverty line adopted (Table BI.A.4.1). As a caveat, these surveys may not capture very recent

  3	   In all countries, official household surveys are used: in Mongolia, the Household Socio-Economic Survey; in the Philippines, the Family Income and Expenditure Survey; in
       Thailand, the Household Socio-Economic Survey; and in Vietnam, the Household Living Standard Survey.
  4	   The analysis adopts this global definition of poverty, rather than official national poverty lines, for two reasons: this approach allows for cross-country comparisons; and
       decomposing changes in poverty changes into the impact of different income sources requires poverty to be defined in terms of income. Official poverty estimates vary in
       terms of both the poverty threshold, and the welfare aggregate used to define the threshold. In particular, poverty is computed using consumption in Mongolia, Thailand,
       and Vietnam, but income in the Philippines. And the official poverty line, in 2011 PPP terms, equaled, in Mongolia, US$5.79 in 2014; in the Philippines, US$3.00 in 2015;
       in Thailand, US$6.25 in 2013; and in Vietnam, US$3.44 in 2014.

    developments; in particular, the pace of poverty reduction in Mongolia may have decelerated in 2016,
    owing to the macroeconomic crisis and the consequent slowing of growth. Since the time spanned by the
    surveys differs across countries, the analysis focuses on the annualized percentage point change in poverty.
    As discussed, this is then split into the labor and nonlabor income components. In turn, the labor income
    component is split into demographic, employment, and labor income per employed adult components.5

    Reductions in poverty are larger where the labor incomes of the poor have increased faster. In
    particular, in Mongolia, relatively rapid growth in labor incomes, stemming from rising employment rates,
    wages, and farm incomes, accounted for a 2.2 out of the total 2.3 percentage points annualized reduction
    in poverty (Figure BI.A.4.1, red bars in all panels, referring to employment rates, and blue bars, referring
    to labor incomes per employed adult). In the other countries, poverty fell more slowly—by an annualized
    1 percentage point in the Philippines and Thailand, and 0.7 percentage points in Vietnam. But, similarly,
    a large share of the total poverty reduction was accounted for by growing farm incomes and wages in
    Thailand, and by growing wages (offsetting a fall in farm incomes) in the Philippines and Vietnam.

    Demographics have had a noticeable impact on poverty. In the Philippines, and to a lesser extent in
    Thailand and Vietnam, the aggregate dependency ratio has been falling in recent years, so that demographics
    has helped reduce poverty (Figure BI.A.4.1, green bar in all panels). In contrast, in Mongolia, a rising
    dependency ratio acted to increase poverty.6




    5	      Formally, household income per capita (Y_pc) may be decomposed as follows (see Paes de Barros et al. 2006):
                                                                                             n    L              n    NL
                                                                   Ypc = nA/n [nE/nA (Σ iEA y i ) + 1/nA Σ iEA y i ],
    	       where (nA/n) denotes the share of adults in a household, which is multiplied by income per adult; and income per adult is further decomposed into the amounts reflecting
                               L                             NL
            labor earnings ( y i ) and nonlabor earnings ( y i ). To compute contributions to the change in poverty, counterfactual distributions are calculated by replacing the value
            of a component in the initial period with its corresponding value in the final period. Since panel data are not available, households are sorted by their income per capita,
            and relative household ranks are assumed constant. The decomposition is implemented using the method developed by Azevedo, Nguyen, and Sanfelice (2012), where the
            cumulative effect of each component is calculated across all paths in every possible order, and then averaged.
    6	      The dependency ratio fell from 40.5 to 36.5 percent in the Philippines, from 29.9 to 28.2 percent in Thailand, and from 33.7 to 29.8 percent in Vietnam, during 2005–15.
            It increased in Mongolia from 30.8 to 32.3 percent during 2010–15.
                                                                                                                                                                           (continued)

  In most countries, public transfers have also made a significant contribution to poverty reduction. They
  account for a 0.4 percentage point annualized reduction in poverty in the Philippines, and 0.3 percentage
  points in Mongolia and Thailand (Figure BI.A.4.1, second green bar in all panels). Only in Vietnam is the
  impact of transfers small compared to other drivers of poverty reduction.

  In Mongolia, the commodity boom and government programs have had a significant impact on
  poverty reduction. Real wages outside agriculture grew by 28 percent, driven by labor productivity growth.
  Earnings in agriculture rose by an even faster 77 percent, reflecting higher livestock prices and a move
  by many households into the production of animal byproducts, subsidized under a government incentive
  scheme. The various transfers programs, including cash transfers for children, mothers, and the elderly,
  have also contributed to a large share of the welfare improvement among low-income families. With the end
  of the commodity boom, there is now a need for significant fiscal adjustment, and for major reforms in the
  design of these programs to ensure their sustainability.

  In the Philippines, higher wages as well as transfers played a key role in poverty reduction. Wages
  in manufacturing and services, especially for low-skilled workers, grew rapidly, in line with sectoral labor
  productivity. This compensated for slow productivity growth in agriculture, which has particularly affected
  small producers. The large impact of transfers is partly due to recent improvements in the coverage,
                                                                                                                                                                                  (continued)

    targeting, and monitoring of social programs. However, looking ahead, further poverty reductions will hinge
    on reducing unemployment (among the highest in the region, hovering around 6 to 7 percent during
    2010–15), particularly among the young.

    In Thailand, farm incomes played a key role in poverty reduction. The importance of farm income
    partly reflects structural problems: a slowdown in nonagricultural employment growth and the stalling of
    structural transformation, combined with the struggle within agriculture to move labor from low- to higher-
    productivity jobs. Rising farm incomes largely reflect the impact of increases in agricultural prices rather
    than productivity; as agricultural prices fall back again, a process that has already started, the impact on
    poverty will no longer be favorable. Private transfers, consisting mainly of remittances, are also an important
    source of income: over one-fifth of Thai households have migrants, with the highest proportions being from
    poor households and disadvantaged regions.

    In Vietnam, nonagricultural jobs have been the main drivers of poverty reduction. The secondary
    and tertiary sectors grew almost twice as fast as the agricultural sector over the period (about 6 percent and
    3 percent a year, respectively). The poor obtain a relatively high share of income from farming, but their
    agricultural income per capita is lower than that of other groups. And, over the sample period, incomes from
    farming increased only for those in the top 40 percent of the income distribution.

    Ultimately, further sustained reductions in poverty will rely on rapid growth in labor incomes
    among the poor. Public transfers and remittances play an important role in sustaining a minimum welfare,
    and compensating for unforeseen shocks. But further increases in the standard of living, leading to the
    eradication of poverty and the reduction of vulnerability, require gains in employment and real earnings,
    whether through wages, farm incomes, or business incomes. Moreover, increases in labor earnings, linked
    to gains in labor productivity, will become even more critical as East Asian countries age, dependency ratios
    rise, and the favorable demographic conditions of the past dissipate.

I.B.	 Outlook and Risks
        Global growth and commodity prices are projected to recover slowly, while global financial conditions
        tighten gradually. Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific is expected to remain resilient, as continued
        buoyancy in domestic demand, including public and increasingly private investment, is supported by
        strengthening external demand. China is expected to continue its gradual transition to lower, more
        sustainable growth. In the rest of the region, growth is expected to increase moderately. Poverty will
        continue to fall across most of the region, reflecting rising labor incomes and low unemployment.
        Nevertheless, global and regional vulnerabilities mean that the positive prospects for growth and
        poverty reduction in the region in this base case are subject to significant risks. A sharp global financial
        tightening and rising financial vulnerabilities among households and corporates may test countries with
        elevated external debt, or high and rising private sector leverage. Significant slowdowns in world trade,
        whether stemming from mounting global protectionist pressures or from unanticipated weakness in
        global activity, could adversely affect most of the region. Fiscal deficits are expected to remain elevated
        in several countries, in some cases posing risks to fiscal sustainability.




Growth is expected to moderate in China, but pick up slightly in the rest
of the region

Global growth and commodity prices are projected to recover slowly, while global financial conditions
tighten gradually  (Box I.B.1). Global growth is projected to increase from 2.3 percent to 2.7 percent in 2017,
driven by some acceleration in advanced economies and a more robust pickup in developing economies. Monetary
policy is expected to continue normalizing in the United States, reflecting the pickup in activity, and remain
accommodative in other advanced economies. Capital flows to the region are projected to remain relatively stable.
Oil prices are expected to edge upward, but are unlikely to return to historical highs, given uncertainty regarding
whether recent cuts in oil production will be maintained, as well as the potential flows of shale oil; similarly, well-
stocked global food markets, and the considerable spare capacity in the mining and metal industry, will limit
increases in other commodity prices.

Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) is expected to remain resilient during 2017–19, as
continued buoyancy in domestic demand is supported by gradually strengthening external demand. The
outlook remains more positive than for other regions, with the exception of South Asia. China’s gradual transition
to slower but more sustainable growth is projected to continue (Table I.B.1). In the large ASEAN economies,
growth is expected to pick up slightly. In several countries, activity will also be supported by increased government
spending, especially on infrastructure projects. Commodity exporters will benefit from the projected recovery in
commodity prices.

China’s growth moderation and rebalancing are expected to continue in the medium term. Growth is
projected at 6.5 percent in 2017, reflecting somewhat stronger net exports than in 2016 but a moderation in the
real estate sector following tightening policy measures. Growth is expected to further moderate to 6.3 percent

In the other large developing economies in the region, growth is projected to pick up moderately. In
the Philippines, growth expectations have been revised upward sharply, to 6.9 percent in 2017–18, reflecting
increases in public infrastructure spending, a recent uptick in private investment, continued credit expansion,
and growth in remittances. In Indonesia, growth is projected to rise to 5.2 percent in 2017 and 5.4 percent in
2019, as commodity prices firm, credit growth continues to respond to loose monetary policy, and the impact of
fiscal consolidation dissipates over time.2 In Malaysia, growth is expected to edge up to 4.3 percent in 2017 and
4.5 percent by 2018. Domestic demand will benefit from a stable labor market, income support measures, and
higher infrastructure spending; exports will again benefit from rising commodity prices and recovery in growth in
advanced economies. In Vietnam, growth will recover to 6.3 percent in 2017, as the impact of the 2016 drought

  Box I.B.1. Global Outlook and Risks1
  Global growth is expected to strengthen in 2017. After reaching a postcrisis low of 2.3 percent in
  2016, global growth is expected to increase to a moderate 2.7 percent in 2017, mainly driven by stronger
  growth in Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), as obstacles to activity among commodity
  exporters gradually diminish (Figure BI.B.1.1). Among advanced economies, growth is projected to recover
  modestly, from 1.7 percent in 2016 to 1.8 percent in 2017. These forecasts do not incorporate the effects of
  policy proposals by the new U.S. administration, as their precise content remains uncertain.

  EMDE growth is expected to accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2017, from 3.4 percent in 2016. With
  commodity prices gradually recovering, growth among commodity-exporting EMDEs is projected to average
  2.3 percent in 2017 after two consecutive years of near stagnation, still significantly below historical averages.
  In contrast, growth in commodity-importing EMDEs is expected to remain broadly stable at 5.6 percent. The
  growth divergence between commodity exporters and importers is projected to narrow, but regions with a
  large number of commodity exporters, such as Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa, will
  continue to underperform in 2017 (Figure BI.B.1.2). In contrast, regions dominated by large commodity-
  importing economies, such as East Asia and Pacific and South Asia, are projected to continue to experience
  solid growth this year. Growth in low-income countries is expected to recover from 4.7 percent in 2016 to
  5.6 percent in 2017, as the external environment is expected to improve gradually, with commodity prices
  increasing moderately from low levels, and global trade regaining some momentum.
  Global trade is projected to grow faster than global output in 2017. The recovery in global trade growth
  will be supported by stronger import demand from major advanced economies, and a diminished drag from
  weak import demand in commodity-exporting EMDEs. However, structural impediments to trade, including
  maturing global value chains and uncertainty about trade policies in the United States, will continue to
  weigh on the medium-term outlook.

    a balanced market and no additional OPEC supply
    restraint. Average metal and mineral prices are projected to rise by 11 percent in 2017, the first increase in
    six years, as a result of supply constraints, including closures of large lead and zinc mines and stronger-than-
    expected demand from China. Overall agricultural prices are expected to remain stable in 2017, but the
    outlook varies across individual commodities depending on supply conditions. Small increases are expected
    for oils and agricultural raw materials, owing to adverse weather affecting supplies from East Asia. These
    will be offset by a small decline in grains prices, given favorable growing conditions in Central Asia, Europe,
    and North America.
    Monetary policy normalization, improved growth prospects, and elevated policy uncertainty in
    advanced economies are likely to weigh on capital flows to EMDEs in 2017. The United States is expected
    to increase interest rates at a moderate pace in 2017 and 2018, following two earlier hikes implemented
    in this tightening cycle. The tightening cycle could gather pace if fiscal stimulus were undertaken in the
    United States, although this is not assumed in the baseline projections absent additional details. In Japan,
    the Central Bank has committed to expanding its monetary base and maintaining policy rates at record-low
    levels until inflation exceeds 2 percent for a sustained period. However, rising inflation could lead to a slow
    unwinding of large asset purchase programs earlier than expected. Overall, aggregate capital inflows to
    EMDEs are expected to remain subdued, affecting local currencies and assets. Capital outflows from China—
    the key driver of aggregate outflows in EMDEs—should continue to ease, reflecting tighter capital controls
    and heightened foreign exchange interventions. Relatively attractive valuations should support portfolio
    inflows to EMDE, but FDI is likely to remain weak. Higher oil and commodity prices could partly offset the
    negative impact for commodity exporters. This outlook is conditioned on an improved EMDE growth outlook
    and a gradual tightening of global financing conditions.
    Although the external environment is expected to gradually improve for EMDEs, the range of
    possible outcomes has widened significantly given ongoing policy uncertainties, and there are still
    significant risks to global growth. Political developments in 2016—most notably, the U.S. presidential
    elections and the U.K. Brexit referendum—have heightened policy uncertainty, and their effect may be
    compounded by upcoming elections in several European countries. This and other risks, including in
    particular financial market disruptions amid tighter global financing conditions, may be amplified over the
    medium term by mounting protectionist tendencies, slower potential growth, and elevated vulnerabilities
    in some EMDEs. However, any fiscal stimulus in major economies, such as the United States, could lead to
    stronger-than-expected global growth, improving the outlook.

dissipates, and in line with favorable market sentiments and continued strong FDI flows. In Thailand, activity
is expected to benefit from improved confidence following the adoption of the new constitution and the royal
transition, large public investment projects, and robust tourism, although continued weak productivity will cap
growth at 3.4 percent even in 2019.

The smaller regional economies are generally expected to continue to benefit from rapid growth in their
neighbors and higher commodity prices. In Cambodia, growth will remain around 6.9 percent, as stronger fiscal
expansion, agricultural reforms, and continued buoyancy of tourism offset a slight moderation in construction
and garments. Lao PDR also enjoys a strong outlook, as increases in electricity generation and exports offset
the impact of the envisaged fiscal consolidation. In Myanmar, growth is projected to accelerate as infrastructure
spending (in power, transportation, and communications) rises, and delayed foreign investment commitments are
unlocked in response to strengthened macroeconomic stability and progress on structural reforms. In Mongolia,
growth will stagnate in 2017, partly reflecting efforts to reduce public debt to sustainable levels, before staging
a modest recovery in 2018. A strong rebound is projected starting in 2019, reflecting successful macroeconomic
stabilization, structural reforms, and the likely expansion of mining investments. Similarly, in Papua New Guinea,
growth will gradually recover as a number of mining and petroleum prospects come on stream. In Timor-Leste,
the elections later this year will slow some public investment projects; however, nonoil growth will recover in outer
years, as the impact of falling oil production is cushioned by large withdrawals from the sovereign wealth fund.

increasingly focused on less well-off regions. In Lao PDR and Timor-Leste, continued investments in basic
infrastructure, including roads, electrification, irrigation, and water and sanitation, aim to improve access to
services and opportunities for income generation.

However, the outlook for poverty reduction remains mixed in a few countries and among some groups.
In Mongolia, the recent decreases in poverty may decelerate or even reverse in the short term, reflecting the
sharp growth slowdown and high unemployment. But the medium-term outlook remains more positive, assuming
successful macroeconomic stabilization and the projected recovery in commodity prices. Vulnerability to weather
shocks remains a challenge for faster poverty reduction among the region’s rural, agricultural poor.




Domestic demand will support growth, with a rising contribution from exports,
across much of the region

Private consumption will remain buoyant, supported by tight labor markets and higher public transfers.
Overall, private consumption will account for more than 40 percent of all growth, or 60 percent in the region
excluding China (Figure I.B.1). Private consumption growth is expected to stabilize at around 7 percent in China,
the Philippines, and Vietnam, 6 percent in Malaysia, and above 5 percent in Indonesia. Robust labor markets
will put upward pressure on wages: unemployment is currently at its lowest level since at least 2012 in China,
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, and remains low in Malaysia and Thailand. As a result, monthly earnings
have been trending upward in Indonesia and Vietnam, although pressures remain more subdued in Malaysia and
Thailand. Increases in social transfers, and growing remittances, will also continue supporting household incomes.

The outlook for public consumption varies, reflecting countries’ different policy choices. Public consumption
growth is expected to accelerate in Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, where the 2017 budgets all envisage
increases in public sector wages, and in Indonesia. In contrast, public consumption growth is projected to decelerate
in Mongolia, consistent with efforts to narrow the large fiscal imbalance and support macroeconomic stabilization,
and in Lao PDR and Vietnam.

Investment growth will moderate in China and Vietnam but increase in most of the rest of the region, as
governments embark upon ambitious public investment projects, and businesses benefit from continued low
interest rates and improved sentiment. In China, investment growth is expected to moderate, as the authorities
attempt to contain the buildup in debt and reduce excess capacity. In the region excluding China, the contribution
of investment to growth is expected to rise from 1.8 percentage points in 2016 to 2.4 percentage points in 2019,
reflecting a scale-up of public investment, as well as robust private investment underpinned by broadly sound
fundamentals and in some cases ongoing structural reforms. In recent years, a number of economies, including
Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, have seen a decline in capital expenditure and as a result, a number
of developing EAP countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Fiji, may be underinvesting in
infrastructure (Asian Development Bank 2017). Looking ahead, the authorities in several countries have announced
ambitious plans to increase capital expenditure and address infrastructure bottlenecks. Investment is projected to
grow especially rapidly in the Philippines, where the authorities are embarking upon a multiyear infrastructure
program of about US$160 billion (approximately half of 2016 GDP) (Figure I.B.2). In Thailand, the 2017 budget

projected pickup in commodity prices and strong prospects for mining FDI. In Vietnam, in contrast, fiscal tightening
will contribute to lower investment growth.

Exports are projected to gradually recover across most of the region; in some countries, rising domestic
demand will also significantly boost imports. Regional manufacturing exporters are expected to benefit from
the pickup in global demand, and commodity exporters from firming commodity prices (Figure I.B.1, Figure I.B.2,
and Figure I.B.3). At the same time, robust domestic demand, and the region’s strong participation in global
value chains, will also boost imports. This effect will be particularly pronounced in the Philippines, given its
investment push and buoyant consumption, as reflected in the accounting contribution of net exports to growth. In
Thailand, the export potential remains limited by continued productivity weakness. In China, however, exports are
expected to recover over the medium term, while the ongoing rebalancing limits import growth. In Vietnam, export
performance will remain robust, building on strong FDI inflows. In Malaysia, commodity exports are expected to
grow over time. In Cambodia, export growth will be underpinned by a resilient garment sector and emerging
diversification into other manufacturing products. In Lao PDR, electricity exports will grow over time, partly offset
by depletion of deposits at the country’s two large mines.

In some commodity exporters, production bottlenecks could limit the supply response to recovering
commodity prices. In Myanmar, natural gas exports will be affected by capacity constraint. In Papua New Guinea,
petroleum exports will be affected by similar concerns, and mining exports by production disruptions at two mines,
with knock-on effects on consumption and investments. In Mongolia, recently announced mining projects will
require time to develop. In Timor-Leste, oil resources are being rapidly depleted.

increased volatility and risk premia in financial markets, as seen in the immediate wake of the U.S. election
and the late-2016 increase in U.S. policy rates. As a result, debt-service burdens and debt-rollover risks would
increase, especially for unhedged borrowers with short-term, foreign-currency-denominated debt. Malaysia, and to

         earnings. Relatedly, loans of RM100 million (approximately US$23 million) and above require central bank approval, and must be adequately hedged or supported by foreign currency
         receivables.

stress, which could spill over to banks. Debt service ratios for the private nonfinancial sector have been rising
steadily over the past five years (Figure I.B.7), and are now particularly high in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and
probably Vietnam. Likewise, interest coverage ratios (the ratios of available company earnings to current interest
payments) have weakened significantly over the past five years in several countries, suggesting a deterioration in
the financial health of corporates (Figure I.B.8).

The rise in real estate prices across much of the region is also raising financial vulnerabilities, although
these risks still appear manageable, in part because of recent corrective measures. The rapid growth of
credit for real estate transactions has pushed up property prices and increased household indebtedness across
many regional economies. There is a risk that sharp downward corrections in real estate prices will lead to a
large deterioration in banks’ asset quality, and a reduction in their profitability and lending capacity. Indeed,
in recent decades, boom-bust patterns in property prices have frequently led to systemic banking crises, whose
resolution can prove extremely costly.4 In response to rising vulnerabilities, some countries have been introducing
macroprudential measures. Partly as a result, the trend of rising credit and prices has moderated over the past year
(Box I.B.2).

Overall, the region’s banks are relatively well capitalized, but vulnerabilities are increasing. Banking
systems are facing an increasingly difficult operating environment, characterized by lower bank profitability,
deteriorating asset quality, and potential liquidity risks. Banks’ profitability is steadily decreasing across most of
the region (Figure I.B.9 and Figure I.B.10). This partly reflects a steady increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs)
(Figure I.B.11); reported NPL levels remain generally low by global standards, but whether these data accurately
reflect the true extent of the deterioration in asset quality is in question in several countries.5 Further, bank lending
margins are being squeezed as yield curves flatten worldwide. In response, banks in Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Thailand are increasingly turning to very short-term wholesale funding, including interbank and
money market financing, but this exacerbates maturity mismatches and increases exposure to interest rate risk. In
China, smaller regional banks have been relying heavily on shadow banking products for liquidity, and could be

significantly affected by the tightening of regulations on these instruments. That said, banks in the region are in
general relatively well capitalized, with most of the larger economies already meeting Basel III capital requirements
(Figure I.B.12),6 and well positioned to meet other Basel III requirements, including minimum liquidity standards.7

Illustrative, model-based resilience tests suggest that financial systems in the region are broadly resilient
to shocks, but there exist risks. Simulations indicate that even large shocks to U.S. monetary policy, combined
with large exchange rate depreciations, would exert significant but in general manageable effects on banking
sectors (Table I.B.3). The largest strains would emerge in China, with particularly sharp increases in nonperforming
loans and decreases in profitability. And the need for caution is heightened by uncertainties about the current
level of nonperforming assets, and the potential for distress at the level of individual banks to affect the rest of
the financial system. In Malaysia, despite large open foreign exchange positions, negative impacts appear to be
dampened by the banking sector’s significant buffers.

    Box I.B.2. The Real Estate Sector and Risks to Financial Stability1

    Low interest rates and ongoing residential shortages, due to rapidly rising real incomes, have driven
    up housing prices in several large regional economies in recent years, although the upward trend
    generally moderated in 2016. Regional banks have provided plenty of capital to the real estate sector at
    favorable conditions. Real housing prices have increased significantly since 2010 in several countries, in
    particular Malaysia, but also the Philippines and Thailand (Figure BI.B.2.1). In Indonesia, in contrast, growth
    in residential property prices has trended down over the past three years, reflecting the moderation of the
    credit boom. In China, house prices have generally been rising fast in large (“Tier 1”) cities, but much more
    slowly in the smaller (“Tier 2” and “Tier 3”) cities (Figure BI.B.2.2), reflecting stronger demand for, and
    lower supply of, housing in the large cities.2

    2	        Large cities have experienced much faster population growth, reflecting significant inflows of migrants attracted by greater availability of jobs. At the same time, in large
              cities a significant scarcity of land has slowed the construction of new buildings since 2005, whereas in smaller cities land supply is continuing to grow.

  Real estate sales are volatile. In China, there have been significant swings over time in sales of residential
  floor space (Figure BI.B.2.3, Panel A), especially at the level of individual cities (panel B), and in overall real
  estate sales (Figure BI.B.2.4). In Indonesia, property sales have also experienced significant volatility over
  the past five years (Figure BI.B.2.5).

    A more detailed examination of country-level trends also suggests broadly manageable risks. In
    Malaysia, banks are considerably exposed to real estate, which accounts for approximately half of total
    loans. However, growth in loans and housing prices moderated in 2016, and the deceleration is expected to
    continue in 2017.5 Residential transactions account for about two-thirds of total real estate transactions, and
    risks are mitigated by households’ financial capacity—aggregate household assets are about twice as large
    as household debt. Further, financial institutions are relatively well capitalized. In the Philippines, the rapid
    expansion of the real estate sector over the past four years reflects still low rates of home ownership and
    limited alternative investment opportunities. Commercial RELs increased by 117 percent, and residential
    RELs by 80 percent, between Q1 2013 and Q3 2016. As a result, real estate prices have been rising rapidly
    in Metro Manila. Buyers from China probably also contribute, at least in the high-end condo market.6 So
    far, nonperforming RELs have been decreasing.7 In Vietnam, growth in real estate loans to households and
    developers is moderating. However, real estate developers are focusing on high-end real estate projects,
    which currently yield large profit margins, creating a risk of potential oversupply in the medium term. In
    contrast, residential housing for low- and middle-income households remains limited.8

  (Box I.B.2 continued)


  Across much of the region, macroprudential measures have been introduced to mitigate potential
  risks associated with the expansion of credit to the real estate sector. In Malaysia, measures already
  introduced to rein in excessive property market speculation include stringent loan requirements for housing
  loans, and a 70 percent loan-to-value ratio cap on third-home purchases. In Vietnam, to curb the growth of
  real-estate business loans, caps have been imposed on loan-to-deposit ratios (80 to 90 percent, depending
  on the type of bank) and on the share of long-term loans financed using short-term deposits (60 percent
  in 2016, 50 percent in 2017, and 40 percent in 2018). In China, mortgage loans have been rising quickly
  until recently,9 leading to growing household leverage. To cool the property market, local governments in
  more than 20 cities rolled out tightening measures during the fall of 2016. Policies have included raising
  mortgage down payments, tightening loan-to-value limit, and posting home purchase restrictions, especially
  for citizens without a local household registration. Several cities have also introduced measures to control
  land prices, including imposing caps on land auction prices.

  Indonesia, however, has gone in the opposite direction, with the authorities recently implementing
  a number of measures to support real estate activity. These measures include cutting the key interest
  rate, giving tax incentives to Indonesian real estate investment trusts, easing restrictions on individual
  foreign ownership,10 increasing the maximum loan-to-value ratio, and increasing the threshold for luxury
  property tax. A tax amnesty was also expected to lead to repatriation of assets and to their investment in
  real estate assets.11

  In Mongolia, real estate led to significant financial vulnerabilities. Mongolia’s real estate market
  emerged after the privatization of the housing sector in the late 1990s, and in tandem with the rapid
  expansion of Ulaanbaatar over the last two decades. Housing construction has been a major driver of
  growth since the early 2000s, reflecting high housing demand,12 and the sector has been supported by the
  authorities through various programs. The mortgage program funded by the Central Bank was one of the
  key contributors to a 30 percent price jump for quality houses between 2012 and 2013; the nontargeted
  program allowed middle-income borrowers to refinance previous mortgages or buy second homes.13
  However, housing prices began to fall at end-2014 as economic growth slowed significantly, and continued
  dropping through January 2017. As a result, the banking sector’s nonperforming loans increased sharply.14
  Looking ahead, and within the framework of a reform program to be supported by development partners,
  the authorities will consider transferring the housing mortgage loan program out of the central bank and
  restructuring it, which will help tackle the distortions in the system.

SUSTAINING RESILIENCE




A sharp slowdown in world trade or in China could significantly affect the region

Developing EAP is extremely open, and could therefore prove particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in
international trade. The region is significantly more open to trade than South Asia or Latin America and the
Caribbean (Figure I.B.13, panel A). Among the large economies, trade openness is particularly high in Malaysia,
Thailand, and Vietnam (panel B). Advanced economies, including the United States and the European Union,
account for a significant share of the trade of several countries (including Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Thailand,
and Vietnam), and in particular constitute a critical source of final demand for the region’s exports (World Bank
2016b). This significantly raises the region’s vulnerability to a slowdown in trade, whether stemming from trade
restrictions or from unanticipated weakness in global activity. Among key concerns, the change in administration
in the United States has brought in expectations of mounting protectionist pressures, including potential unilateral
measures to tackle perceived currency manipulation and other unfair trading practices, especially vis-à-vis countries
with which the United States runs large trade deficits.8 Illustrating such risks, the withdrawal of the United States
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership could cause Vietnam and to a lesser extent Malaysia to miss out on gains from
expanded trade and investment (World Bank 2016a). Any new U.S. trade restrictions would have a particularly
significant impact on countries whose direct trade links with the United States are sizable or that are deeply
integrated into regional value chains, including China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Antiglobalization
sentiment has also been picking up in other advanced economies holding elections this year, including France,
Germany, and the Netherlands. Again, the recent recovery in economic activity in the European Union could be
dented by a disorderly Brexit, or by the outcome of the upcoming elections. Compounding risks, disruptions to
world trade would also likely affect capital flows; and more tense international economic relations could lead to
more complex geopolitical relations.

In China, the ongoing slowdown constitutes a short-term risk to growth in the rest of the region, but
rebalancing will also generate medium-term opportunities for several lower-income countries. China
accounts for a large and rising share of demand for goods and services from the rest of the region, both to meet
its own final demand and as inputs into further exports. It exerts a critical influence on world commodity prices,
especially for metals. Financial links, especially through outward FDI, are also growing rapidly. As a result, China’s
orderly, gradual slowdown to date has been an important factor behind the region’s continued strong growth
resilience. However, if the slowdown in activity were to prove faster than anticipated, spillovers to other countries
could prove significant (World Bank 2016b). At the same time, the ongoing transformation in China’s economic
structure opens up new export opportunities for its trade partners. In particular, it will create space for other
countries to expand their production of labor-intensive manufactures, and to meet China’s growing demand for
agricultural commodities and for services. Reaping these opportunities will, however, require countries to adjust
their production and export structures, which will in turn require reforms to ensure that labor and product markets
are more flexible (Box I.B.3).




Fiscal deficits are expected to remain elevated in several countries,
in some cases posing risks to fiscal sustainability

Fiscal deficits are expected to widen or remain elevated in a number of countries in 2017. In China, the
consolidated fiscal deficit is projected to expand slightly (to around 3.8 percent of GDP) as recent tax measures
(including tax breaks and lower pension contribution rates) adversely affect collections (Figure I.B.14). Among
the other large economies, the increase in the deficit will be particularly marked in Thailand as a number of large
infrastructure projects are launched. A stronger expansion is also projected in the Philippines, largely reflecting
increased expenditure. More limited fiscal expansion is expected in Indonesia, where higher capital expenditure
will be partially offset by tax reforms and higher commodity revenues. Similarly, deficits will increase or remain
elevated in Cambodia and Lao PDR, reflecting rising public sector wages in the former and high infrastructure
spending in the latter. Both countries have announced plans to lower deficits over the medium term, but have not
spelled out details of the policies that might underpin such adjustment. In Timor-Leste, a large structural deficit

    Box I.B.3. The Long-Run Impact of China’s Rebalancing on Developing East Asia and Pacific1

    China’s ongoing reform process will lead to a rebalancing of its economic structure, and slower
    but more sustainable growth, with potentially significant repercussions for the rest of developing
    EAP. The goal of these reforms is to reorient the economy toward consumption, services, and higher-value-
    added activities, so as to reverse the recent slowdown in productivity growth. Given China’s central role in
    the global economy, this structural transformation will have a significant impact on world trade flows and
    prices. In turn, this will affect its trading partners, including in the region, both directly, and indirectly as
    other trading partners adjust and reallocate resources.

    The implications of China’s rebalancing for other countries in developing EAP are analyzed by
    contrasting outcomes under “full reform” with those under “partial reform.” Full reform is characterized
    by more pronounced rebalancing, and results in faster long-run productivity growth. Specifically, the full
    reform scenario assumes significant rebalancing from investment toward consumption (Figure BI.B.3.1,
    Panel A) and from industry toward services. GDP growth decelerates only modestly, to 6 percent by 2025
    (Panel B). In contrast, the partial reform scenario assumes greater emphasis on policies that maintain
    short-run growth above potential, and less on rebalancing toward consumption and services. As a result,
    GDP growth, after rising initially, decelerates rapidly to 4 percent by 2025.2 In contrast, and for reference,
    a continuation of the current economic model, with GDP growth around 6.5 percent and limited or no
    rebalancing toward consumption or services, would require implausibly rapid productivity growth, pointing
    to the difficulty of sustaining current growth rates without continued reforms.

    The focus of the analysis is on long-run responses to Chinese policy reforms rather than on short-
    run impacts, and it assumes that other economies are flexible enough to adjust their production
    and export structure in response to China’s rebalancing. The analysis is based on a dynamic general

  equilibrium model that captures trade links across countries and sectors.3 It goes beyond short-run cyclical
  effects to capture long-run responses of supply, demand, and trade to changes in relative prices. It allows
  for China’s production structure to shift toward higher-value-added manufactures and services, and for the
  import intensity of China’s consumption to increase in response to rebalancing. It also allows other economies
  to adjust to China’s structural transformation by reallocating resources. In contrast, econometric and input-
  output studies tend to capture short-run effects, as they implicitly assume that the sectoral composition and
  import intensity of consumption and investment remain constant.

  In general, the deepening of the ongoing reforms in China affects other countries through trade
  links, changes in world prices, and terms-of-trade effects. By 2025, output, household consumption,
  and even investment in China are significantly higher under full reform than under partial reform.4 Increased
  consumption acts to increase China’s demand for other countries’ exports, and in particular puts upward
  pressure on prices of agricultural commodities and food products (Figure BI.B.3.2, Panel A). At the same
  time, and as set out in the “Made in China 2025” plan, China aims to upgrade its manufacturing sector
  toward high-value-added manufactures, including by targeting the development of sectors such as robotics,
  aerospace, new-energy vehicles, and advanced transport equipment. The increase in China’s supply of
  machinery and transport equipment exerts a downward pressure on their world prices. Cheaper imports of
  these capital goods improve the terms of trade of countries that are net importers and act to boost their
  domestic investment. In addition, diminishing supply in China of low-value-added manufactures, such as
  textiles and apparel, acts to increase their world prices.

  Overall, across most of developing EAP, full reform leads to terms-of-trade gains, and increases in
  exports and consumption. In economies that specialize in the production of low-value-added manufactures
  including textiles and apparel, such as Cambodia and Vietnam, or low-tech electrical and electronic items,
  such as Malaysia and the Philippines, firms benefit from higher world prices (Figure BI.B.3.2, Panel B) and
  expand domestic supply and exports (Panel C). Conversely, the fall in the price of capital goods boost imports
  of these products, with a positive overall effect on total imports. Consumption rises across developing EAP,
  by up to 0.6 percent (Panel D), reflecting overall terms-of-trade gains.

  The analysis highlights how developing EAP countries that can respond to the new sources of
  demand in China will gain the most from China’s structural transformation. Overall, the magnitude
  of the output effects is limited, with output falling by a maximum of 0.1 percent (Panel E). Put differently,
  in aggregate terms, the impact of reforms is felt mainly within China, with only limited trade spillovers to
  the rest of the region. But there is variation across developing EAP. Underlying all this, as China upgrades

       the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 9.1 global trade database for 2011. The simulations are based on an aggregation corresponding to 14 regions and 12 sectors
       (agriculture, energy, food products, textiles and apparel, chemicals, metals, transport equipment, electronics, machinery, other manufactures, utilities, and services).
       Projections for key macroeconomic variables, including GDP, the current account, and investment, are based on the IMF World Economic Outlook. See Lakatos and Go
       (Forthcoming) for details.

       on investment.

    its production structure, other countries adjust their own supply structures to dampen any initial adverse
    impact. Exporters of low-value-added and low-tech manufactures, including Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia,
    and the Philippines, stand to benefit from supplying the excess demand in both Chinese and international
    markets (Panel F). On a cautionary note, the required inter-sectoral reallocation may imply significant
    distributional impacts, particularly in the short run.

has emerged and is projected to widen over time (from 24 percent of GDP in 2016 to 30 percent of GDP in 2017,
with further increases afterward), reflecting the exhaustion of its oil reserves. Its large sovereign wealth fund can
finance this deficit in the medium term, but is being steadily depleted.

A few countries, however, are expected to take some early steps toward fiscal consolidation. In Vietnam,
the deficit is projected to decline to 5.3 percent of GDP by 2019, although the implementation of previously
announced consolidation measures remains lackluster. In Malaysia and Myanmar, fiscal deficits are also expected
to decline, with some support from higher commodity prices, as well as comprehensive reforms to tax policy and
administration and to public financial management in Myanmar. In Mongolia, the deficit ballooned to 17 percent
of GDP in 2016, but is expected to decline sharply as the country implements its ambitious adjustment program
with support from its development partners. Similarly, in Papua New Guinea, a fiscal adjustment program, targeting
both revenues (including through removal of exemptions and higher fees) and expenditures, is projected to lower
the deficit over time.

Rapid growth will generally help contain debt burdens, but there are exceptions. Widening deficits in
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines will have a minor impact on debt-to-GDP ratios (Figure I.B.15),
given rapid growth and (with the exception of Cambodia and to a lesser extent the Philippines) the relatively limited
magnitude of the expansion. In Malaysia, public debt is expected to remain stable, reflecting the offsetting impact
of relatively low deficits and the elevated initial debt level. In Papua New Guinea, fiscal consolidation is expected
to help place public debt on a downward trajectory. In Thailand, in contrast, the expansionary fiscal stance could
see public debt increase to 49 percent of GDP by 2019, although threats to fiscal sustainability remain low. And,
in Lao PDR and Vietnam, public debt is expected to stabilize only once the planned consolidation efforts are more
advanced. In Vietnam, concerns are amplified by the banking sector’s unresolved impaired assets, which could
eventually translate into significant liabilities for the public sector. In Mongolia, approval and implementation of
an adjustment program supported by the international financial institutions will prove critical to restoring debt
sustainability, including meeting the large external debt repayments due over the coming year.

SUSTAINING RESILIENCE




The diverse fiscal outlooks across the region are reflected in varying credit risk assessments. The region is
characterized by the full spectrum of credit ratings, including strong investments grades (in China and Malaysia),
as well as speculative grades (in Mongolia and Papua New Guinea). Ratings were in several cases revised downward
in the first half of 2016, but have since stabilized, reflecting (actual or planned) reform programs. In particular,
Mongolia’s credit rating was maintained, following repeated earlier downgrades, in the wake of the announcement
of the stabilization and reform program. Indonesia’s credit outlook was improved from “stable” to “positive”. And
the most recent IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analyses, for most of the countries where they have been
carried out, indicate low risks to public debt sustainability, albeit with significant exceptions; in particular, there
are moderate risks in Timor-Leste and Vietnam, and high risks in Lao PDR and Mongolia.




The outlook for the Pacific Island Countries is positive,
but they remain especially vulnerable to shocks

The outlook for the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) is positive, given recent trends in fisheries and tourism,
and expanding opportunities for migration and connectivity. Fishing license fees will contribute significantly to
government revenues and domestic demand, although in a few countries they are expected to decrease from recent
peaks, reflecting changes in the climate cycle. Tourism is expected to benefit from the expansion of capacity in
several economies. The implementation of public infrastructure projects, including in ICT, could see the subregion’s
potential growth rate increase as the impact of remoteness and distances is lowered. Recent agreements that
expand access for PIC workers to labor markets in Australia, New Zealand, and other economies could enhance
job opportunities. Over the longer term, fully exploiting these opportunities could increase long-term growth rates
for most PICs by 0.7 to 1 percentage points (Box I.B.4). Inflationary pressures should remain contained, given the
gradual and limited recovery in commodity prices.

However, PICs are especially vulnerable to natural disasters, climate change, and terms-of-trade shocks.
Nearly every year, at least one country is hit by a major natural disaster; vulnerability will remain high even with
an increased policy focus on disaster risk management. In the long run, many PICs are also highly vulnerable to
sea level rise. Shocks to world commodity prices significantly affect livelihoods across the PICs, because they are
highly dependent on imports, and face transportation costs that are both large and heavily influenced by oil prices.

  Box I.B.4. What is Possible in the Pacific in 2040?1

  The combination of extreme remoteness, small size, geographic dispersion, and environmental
  fragility severely limits the range of economic opportunities for many of the Pacific Island Countries
  (PICs). As a consequence, a number of PICs have seen only limited increases in per capita incomes over the
  past 25 years.

  The World Bank has launched a program of research and dialogue on long-term economic opportunities
  and challenges in the Pacific, titled Pacific Possible. This assesses whether fully exploiting available
  opportunities and dealing effectively with major threats could lead to significantly better growth outcomes
  over the next 25 years.2 Opportunities in tourism, labor mobility, the knowledge economy, fisheries, and
  deep sea mining are considered. It also examines the impact of two risks that could undermine development
  gains over the next 25 years if not managed well: noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which are already
  affecting the lives of many Pacific Islanders; and climate change and natural disasters, to which the PICs are
  heavily exposed.

  For each of the opportunities, Pacific Possible develops an “opportunity scenario” in which the
  PICs and their development partners intervene (for instance, through policy changes) to exploit
  the available opportunity. It then estimates the potential gain in per capita incomes, employment, and
  government revenue compared with baseline projections, which typically reflect historical trends.


  Opportunities

  Tourism will provide the main opportunity to accelerate growth and generate employment for many
  countries, with the potential for an additional 1 million tourist arrivals in the region by 2040.
  Increasing the Chinese market, increasing the number of luxury resorts, capturing more of the retiree
  market, and basing cruise ships in the Pacific could lead to an additional 1 million tourists on top of
  the approximately 3 million tourists who are expected to arrive in 2040 under the baseline, business-
  as-usual projections. In Vanuatu, Samoa, and Palau, tourism opportunities could potentially increase per
  capita incomes by more than 20 percent, with employment 7 percent, 19 percent, and around 50 percent
  (respectively) higher than the 2040 baseline. In Fiji and Tonga, per capita incomes and employment could
  rise by about 10 percent relative to the 2040 baseline.

  Additional labor mobility opportunities would generate substantial benefits for the labor-receiving
  and labor-sending countries, and for the migrants themselves. Pacific Possible estimates that new
  access agreements between the PICs and Australia and New Zealand (including an Australia-New Zealand

    Atoll Access Agreement and a Pacific Access Category for Australia), new Pacific caregiver programs, and
    access to new labor markets such as Canada and the Republic of Korea, could generate additional income of
    about US$13 billion for about 240,000 additional permanent migrants (a 30 percent increase in migrants
    compared with the 2040 baseline).3 Workers from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga would be
    likely to benefit most. Labor-sending countries would benefit from remittances and incomes earned by
    seasonal workers, which by 2040 could lead to an increase in per capita incomes of more than 10 percent
    for Kiribati and Tonga and of more than 5 percent for the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.

    Improved internet access and connectivity could translate into additional income of about
    US$1.5 billion and an additional 150,000 jobs by 2040. In recent years, the PICs have liberalized
    telecoms markets and invested heavily in fiber optic cable connections. This creates the basis for significant
    increases in mobile and internet penetration over the next 25 years, which could improve productivity;
    enhance the quality and attractiveness of existing services, for example, in tourism, education, and health;
    and create new market opportunities such as business process outsourcing. The larger PICs are most likely
    to benefit from ICT-enabled opportunities, provided they develop an adequately skilled workforce and a
    conducive business environment. Pursuing these opportunities could add more than 10 percent to per capita
    incomes and around 6 percent to employment in Fiji, and around 2 to 4 percent to per capita incomes and
    employment in Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands.

    Fisheries could generate more than US$300 million in additional revenue by 2040, raising revenues
    by more than 40 percentage points of GDP in Kiribati and Tuvalu, and significantly boosting incomes
    in these countries and in the Federated States of Micronesia. Among other measures, broadening
    participation in the vessel day scheme to include major resource owners such as the Philippines and
    Indonesia, ensuring compliance with robust catch limits to maintain valuable tuna fisheries stocks, allowing
    easier access to and trading of vessel days, and gradually moving from a vessel-based to a catch-based
    system, could by 2040 yield more than US$300 million in additional public revenue, without an increase in
    catch levels or threats to the sustainability of the fisheries stock.4 In Kiribati and Tuvalu, this could translate
    into an increase in per capita incomes of close to 40 percent, while the Federated States of Micronesia could
    see an increase of around 20 percent.

    Deep sea mineral mining still entails significant uncertainty and knowledge gaps with regard to
    economic viability and to social, cultural, and environmental impacts. While several countries have
    granted deep sea mining exploration permits, no commercial deep sea mining operation is yet up and
    running, and there remain significant uncertainties around the potential of the resource, the technological
    requirements, and environmental and social impacts. A precautionary approach is required to ensure that

    4	   The current purse-seine vessel day scheme implemented in 2009 by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) works similarly to a “cap-and-trade” scheme for fishing. Each
         year, the PNA countries (the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu) set the total
         catch limit needed to maintain a healthy fish stock, and translate that catch limit into individual vessel fishing days, which are allocated to and sold by individual countries.

  cost-effective measures are taken to minimize environmental impacts, even if uncertainty remains as to the
  potential for damage.


  Effects on income, employment, and government revenue

  Exploiting these opportunities could increase the long-term average annual growth rate for most
  PICs by 0.7 to 1 percentage points, resulting in incomes that are about 20 to 30 percent higher in
  2040 compared to projections based on historical trends (         Figure BI.B.4.1). For Vanuatu, Samoa, and
  Palau, tourism would be the main driver of higher growth, while fisheries would support higher growth
  in Kiribati, Tuvalu, and the Federated States of Micronesia. Fiji and Tonga have multiple opportunities to
  achieve higher growth, including tourism, labor mobility, and ICT-enabled opportunities. Papua New Guinea
  and the Solomon Islands are projected to receive relatively modest increases in economic growth from the
  specific opportunities discussed in Pacific Possible, but will likely have alternative drivers of growth over
  the next 25 years (for example, in natural resources). The Marshall Islands shows few growth opportunities,
  reflecting the special challenges faced by atoll nations, and the fact that its additional gains from fisheries
  are likely to be more modest than for Kiribati and Tuvalu.5

    government revenue in some countries (Figure
    BI.B.4.3). But even with these increased revenues,
    adequate funding of public services will remain
    difficult in the North Pacific countries, Papua New
    Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Improving public financial and investment management systems
    can ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently and on projects with high returns. Nevertheless, aid
    will remain a critical part of the ongoing collaboration between PICs and their development partners to fill
    structural financing gaps.


    Risks to the outlook

    Economic costs of natural disasters are already high for most PICs—on average between 0.5 and
    6.6 percent of GDP is lost annually—and climate change will increase vulnerabilities. There is,
    however, deep uncertainty around the future speed and intensity of climate change. The annual costs
    of coastal adaptation and adaptation of infrastructure to changes in rainfall and temperature alone are
    estimated to vary from between 1 and 2 percent of 2040 GDP in Samoa to between 12 and 24 percent of
    GDP in Kiribati and the Marshall Islands (with the ranges depending on scenarios for temperature, rainfall,
    and sea levels). International climate finance is thus critical to ensure that climate financing needs do not
    crowd out human development and infrastructure funding.

    The economic burden of NCDs in the Pacific is already high compared with other middle-income
    countries, and is increasing over time, especially as incomes rise. The PICs could lose between 3 and
    10 percent of GDP by 2040 if no action is taken. Apart from continuing to strengthen the evidence base on
    NCDs, priorities include instituting measures to reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods, tobacco, and
    alcohol (including through taxes and regulation), and improving the efficiency and impact of their health
    spending.

I.C.	 Policy Considerations
        Global policy uncertainty remains high, strengthening the case for an emphasis on macroeconomic
        prudence, addressing critical vulnerabilities, and maintaining medium-term fiscal balances that are
        seen as sustainable. Among the region’s large economies, mobilizing additional revenues will create
        the space to sustain growth and foster inclusion, while ensuring that risks to fiscal sustainability remain
        low. In Lao PDR, Mongolia, and some Pacific Island Countries, policies need to focus on reducing
        threats to fiscal solvency. Most countries may need to start considering adjusting their accommodative
        monetary policies as inflation approaches target levels, and given potential pressures on capital flows
        and exchange rates. China should address risks stemming from an overleveraged corporate sector and
        poorly performing state-owned enterprises. Across the region, containing risks from rapid credit growth
        requires improvements in supervision and prudential regulation. The longer-term challenge for the region
        lies in sustaining rapid growth while ensuring greater inclusion. To that end, countries must increase
        productivity, successfully manage a scale-up of public investment, and attract private investment.
        Reallocating public spending toward capital expenditures and underfunded sectors, including health
        and social protection, and increasing the efficiency of such expenditure can bring benefits. Boosting
        regional integration, including by enhancing labor mobility, can partly mitigate the impact of potential
        global protectionist tendencies. And, as the region becomes more prosperous and its environmental
        footprint grows, efforts to reduce agricultural pollution can make growth more sustainable.




Elevated global policy uncertainty places a large premium on
macroeconomic prudence

The risks that the region continues to face, related to the availability and cost of external financing,
and to the prospects for global trade growth and export demand, strengthen the case for a continued
focus on addressing key macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The baseline scenario projects robust domestic private
demand and recovering external demand. Nevertheless, global financial conditions could tighten more rapidly
than anticipated, triggering renewed financial volatility and amplifying the risks from high domestic leverage. And
protectionist pressures in advanced economies could have a large impact on the region, given its trade openness.
Policy makers should therefore retain their emphasis on maintaining sustainable medium-term fiscal frameworks,
standing ready to adjust accommodative monetary policies, and addressing corporate and financial vulnerabilities.


ÌÌMaintaining sustainable medium-term fiscal frameworks

Across the region’s large economies, mobilizing additional revenues will create space for measures to
sustain growth and foster inclusion, while ensuring that risks to fiscal sustainability remain low. Given
broadly robust domestic demand and the prospects for a gradual increase in external demand, there is little
rationale for additional fiscal stimulus at this time. In contrast, efforts to broaden the tax base and improve
tax administration can yield significant gains. In China, increasing the clarity of government and state-owned
enterprise (SOE) finances, as well as strengthening fiscal discipline and hardening budget constraints for subnational

SUSTAINING RESILIENCE




governments and public-benefit SOEs, will help moderate growth in public investment and place public finances
on a more sustainable path.1 A broadening of the tax base, especially at the local level to lower the dependence
of revenues on land sales, and improvements in VAT administration can make room to reform labor taxation
and streamline fees levied on businesses. In Indonesia, the 2017 budget introduced more realistic assumptions.
However, tax collections remain relatively weak, after adjusting for the one-off impact of the tax amnesty. Meeting
the 2017 deficit target may therefore require further measures with respect to tax policy (beyond the implemented
increases in tobacco excises) and administration. In Malaysia, there is significant scope to broaden the base for
personal income tax, and to reduce exemptions from the general sales tax. The Philippines could build on the
existing package of tax reforms, focused on eliminating VAT exemptions and increasing excises on fuels and
automobiles. Further, the economy’s continued rapid growth will hinge on how well the government manages the
large increase in public expenditure. In Vietnam, where public debt is expected to breach the legally prescribed
ceiling of 65 percent of GDP, there is an urgent need to strengthen the credibility of the medium-term fiscal
framework.

Some smaller commodity-exporting economies need to focus on lowering threats to fiscal solvency.
In Mongolia, fiscal consolidation, including more progressive taxation and greater rationalization and better
targeting of expenditures, remains the main priority as part of stabilization. In Lao PDR, elevated public debt is
generating vulnerability to shocks. Efforts are required to boost revenues, on a declining trend in recent years,
and contain expenditure. In Myanmar and Papua New Guinea, limited sources of financing again call for fiscal
prudence, despite somewhat lower public debt. In Myanmar, prudence will also require refraining from monetizing
the deficit. In general, while many countries have announced fiscal consolidation plans, these have been lacking
in detail. A focus on implementing a country-specific mixture of revenue measures (involving increases in tax
rates, adjustments to the generous, untargeted tax exemptions, a strengthening of property and natural resource
taxation, and improved tax administration) and expenditure measures (targeting both the level and efficiency of
spending) would be appropriate.


ÌÌStanding ready to adjust accommodative monetary policies

Much of the region also may need to adjust accommodative monetary policies. While the increase in
consumer prices has so far proved moderate, the more rapid pickup in producer prices and the projected recovery
in commodity prices suggest that pressures will intensify, albeit from a low base. In Indonesia, which lowered policy
rates by 150 basis points during 2016, the monetary easing cycle likely needs to be placed on hold. Similarly, in
the Philippines, policies must be ready to adjust to rising inflationary pressures.

If external financing conditions tighten more rapidly than anticipated, this will place regional exchange
rates under pressure, and again call for domestic monetary tightening. The expected pace of U.S. monetary
policy normalization has already increased sharply over the past months, and could do so again, leading to
renewed capital outflows. The large, financially integrated economies of Malaysia, and to a lesser degree Indonesia
and Thailand, remain relatively exposed to exchange rate risk, potentially affecting both corporates and banks.
Relatedly, short-term volatility could increase again, although foreign exchange reserves in general appear broadly

adequate. In China, continued liberalization of the exchange rate and domestic financial markets may help stem
capital outflows and increase the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.

Some of the smaller economies are already facing significant exchange rate pressures. In Papua New
Guinea and Myanmar, in particular, a combination of greater exchange rate flexibility (Box I.C.1) and monetary
tightening appears warranted. Similarly, Lao PDR should make greater use of the flexibility in the existing
exchange rate regime and consider monetary tightening in case credit growth continues to accelerate. Given the
limited effectiveness of monetary policy in several smaller economies, these measures may need to be supported
by greater fiscal adjustment. In Mongolia, macroeconomic stabilization will require continued monetary policy
tightness and exchange rate flexibility. Conversely, in dollarized Cambodia, the adjustment to any further U.S.
dollar appreciation and the implied loss in competitiveness would require strong demand management.


ÌÌAddressing corporate and financial vulnerabilities

In China, reforms of the corporate sector, including restructuring of SOEs, and measures to bring credit
growth under control are critical to reducing vulnerabilities. Reforms to address excess industrial capacity,
including closures of outdated production facilities and strict controls on new projects, have been initiated and,
as emphasized in the 2017 government work report, remain key tasks for the authorities. They could be usefully
complemented by measures to enhance SOEs’ corporate governance and efficiency. Relatedly, the rapid expansion
of credit increases the risk of disorderly deleveraging with steadily decreasing returns. A continued gradual
tightening of financial discipline, and increased tolerance for insolvencies and bankruptcies, including of SOEs,
would assist financial markets in allocating resources efficiently. Monetary policy started tightening in early 2017,
but further adjustments may be required,2 and better regulation and supervision of shadow banking activities
remains important. Strengthening social transfers and active labor market policies, and facilitating migration to
areas where new jobs are created, will help mitigate any adverse impact on livelihoods and economic activity. In
addition, mortgage debt is rising rapidly, albeit from a low base, and needs to be monitored carefully.

Elsewhere in the region, rapid private sector credit growth and sizable external debts could catalyze the
buildup and transmission of risks; improvements in supervision and prudential regulation are required.
Credit growth remains elevated across much of the region, including Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines,
Myanmar, and Vietnam. The policy response must involve efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision in line
with international best practice. Arrangements for resolving nonperforming loans also need to be improved.3 As
total debt stocks continue increasing, macroprudential regulation will prove increasingly important. In Vietnam,
where strong external positions have been used to build up reserves, greater sterilization and refraining from the
use of administrative credit targets will also help temper credit growth.




2	   The authorities also disclosed in October 2016 guidelines for a pilot debt-equity swap program for corporates, which aims to address high leverage. However, it is yet unclear whether
     these efforts are having any material impact.

     banking system’s significant legacy nonperforming assets.

Ensuring sustained growth and greater inclusion

Sustaining medium-term growth and promoting inclusion will require efforts across a range of areas.
Regional GDP has already recovered well above its precrisis level, and short-term prospects are encouraging.
However, several economies have been experiencing trend slowdowns in both productivity (Box I.C.2) and, in
particular, investment growth (Box I.C.3). This deceleration has occurred at much lower levels of income per capita
than characterized the earlier generation of fast-growing economies in East Asia. While the precise causes differ
across countries, the underlying drivers of this trend include weaknesses in the institutional environment and
investment climate, rising private debt burdens, weak growth prospects in advanced economies, and negative terms-
of-trade shocks. Sustaining robust growth over the medium term will involve addressing a range of bottlenecks, so
as to increase the impact of public investment on productivity, and help crowd in both domestic and foreign private
investment. This issue of the East Asia and Pacific Economic Update discusses three broad reform areas: improving
the quality of public expenditure, responding to potential global protectionist pressures through greater regional
integration, and dealing with the rising threat of agricultural pollution.


ÌÌImproving the quality of public expenditure

Across the region, improving the quality of public spending can bring benefits. While all countries can gain,
this agenda is especially critical in economies with limited fiscal space, as it will help ensure that needed fiscal
adjustments do not affect the most vulnerable or the delivery of key public services.

In China, significant improvements in access to and quality of public services can be achieved through
reform of public finances. Current revenue and expenditure mismatches at the local level result in wide disparities
in welfare expenditure and social service provision. Lower infrastructure spending, combined with a reallocation of
funds from distortionary agricultural support programs, can help free up resources. If combined with complementary
sectoral reforms, these resources can help finance a consolidated, streamlined social protection system, more
equitable educational spending, and improved access to health services for the poor.

A number of economies need to both improve service delivery and sustain infrastructure spending.4 In
Indonesia, more efficient spending on education and agriculture will allow for a reallocation toward underfunded
programs with greater development impact. The 2017 budget represents a step in the right direction, with its
emphasis on sustaining higher allocations for infrastructure, health, and social assistance, and improving the
targeting of energy subsidies and social programs. In Malaysia, priorities include improving the targeting of social
protection, maintaining support for infrastructure development, and increasing the quality of education to address
skills constraints. In Myanmar, limited fiscal space must be refocused toward capital expenditure, including on
critical energy and transport infrastructure, and toward currently underfunded social protection.

Public investments and broader reforms can have a significant impact on agricultural productivity and
food prices, with important implications for poverty. Across the region, both urban and rural poor remain
vulnerable to higher prices, especially for rice and other staple foods. Price stabilization policies have often been

ineffective in containing prices. Measures to boost agricultural productivity and enhance logistics (including
through improvements in irrigation and transport infrastructure, more effective agricultural research, stronger
land titling, and greater competition) are more likely to be effective in reducing food prices and boosting the
incomes of the poor (Box I.C.4).

Greater infrastructure expenditure must be accompanied by a focus on ensuring value for money, and
tackling underlying legal and regulatory barriers to project implementation(World Bank 2016b). Improved
project planning and implementation systems, including procurement regulations, will boost the productivity of
public investment and increase its fiscal multiplier effects. There is significant scope in most countries to strengthen
investment appraisal and planning processes, and bolster interagency collaboration and coordination on investment
projects. In Thailand, reform of public investment management should address the history of challenges with
respect to the timely implementation of large infrastructure projects.


ÌÌBoosting regional integration to offset greater global protectionism

Developing EAP could benefit significantly from               Figure I.C.1. Greater regional integration has already led
                                                              to a significant increase over time in intraregional trade

Several initiatives provide an opportunity to advance regional integration. The United States has withdrawn
from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. However, alternative regional platforms are being discussed to
advance developing EAP’s trade integration. Such agreements will provide greater benefits to the region if they
cover all trade, in both goods and services, do not discriminate against nonmembers, and feature functioning
dispute resolution mechanisms. In particular, faster progress on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership
(comprising the 10 ASEAN members, China, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and India) could help sustain
the integration agenda, provided it addresses such issues as nontariff barriers. The evolving ASEAN Economic
Community could also help promote further liberalization of goods, services, and capital markets. And additional
gains might be available from the various ASEAN+3 initiatives, which involve China, Japan, and Korea.

liberalize trade and investment. In this context, policy
reforms are required in both labor-sending and labor-
receiving countries. Specific priorities include: strengthening regulation of international recruitment agencies, and
providing comparable protection to migrant and local workers; introducing mutual recognition of qualifications,
and increasing the portability of social protection benefits; and adjusting quantity restrictions on migration
regularly, based on economic needs (Chapter II.A, “Boosting Labor Mobility in the ASEAN Economic Community”).

Seizing broader opportunities to expand international trade can also provide significant payoffs. The
WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) came into force in February 2017. Full implementation of the TFA
is expected to lower trade costs in Asia by 14 percent (ad valorem tariff equivalent), with significant gains for
Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia (World Trade Organization 2015). Relatedly, economies in South Asia
are expected to expand rapidly in the next few years, and developing EAP may be able to benefit from penetrating
these fast-growing markets, and helping the region diversify risks.


ÌÌDealing with the rising threat of agriculture pollution

The agricultural sector’s increasingly adverse environmental footprint needs attention across the region.
The aggregate cost of local environmental degradation exceeds 1 percent of GDP across most of the region.5
Much of this reflects the impact of agriculture on soil quality, water quality, and deforestation, with increasingly
serious consequences for human health and biodiversity, and increasingly the productivity of agriculture itself
(chapter II.B, “Tackling Farm Pollution in Developing East Asia”). This particularly threatens the poor, whose
livelihoods are especially dependent on natural resources, and who lack the means to cope with environmental
shocks. So far, policy responses have typically occurred late, lacked the required scale, and ultimately failed to
tackle incentives that distort farming practices and the broader structure of farming. Indeed, agricultural pollution
is often encouraged by current public expenditure programs, including subsidies and regulations favoring the
livestock industry, and direct or indirect fertilizer subsidies. Looking ahead, agricultural agencies must increasingly

redefining food security in terms of micronutrient content and diversity as well as caloric and protein availability.
Similarly, health and environmental agencies must bring agriculture more fully into their fold, to help curb the
rise of chronic disease.


ÌÌAn agenda for the Pacific Island Countries

In the Pacific Island Countries (PICs), maintaining fiscal sustainability, while preserving and increasing
allocations for critical sectors, remains a critical challenge. The fiscal position of many PICs remains vulnerable,
despite recent fiscal surpluses, as both revenue and expenditure are subject to large and frequent shocks. To ensure
fiscal sustainability, reforms need to shore up revenues, contain unproductive spending while boosting critical
expenditures on health and education, and build up buffers against shocks.

Policy reforms in selected sectors may prove transformational over the medium term. Tourism provides
major opportunities to accelerate growth and boost employment. To maximize its benefits, PICs need to tap more
into Chinese tourism, increase the number of luxury resorts, capture more of the retiree market, and encourage
cruise ships to base in the Pacific. Increases in labor mobility, through the expansion of existing and the negotiation
of new agreements, complemented by investments in workers’ human capital, could generate substantial benefits.
Increases in mobile and internet penetration, complemented by a conducive business environment and the
development of a skilled workforce could boost productivity; enhance the quality and attractiveness of existing
services, including tourism, education, and health; and create new market opportunities, including business process
outsourcing. And income from fisheries could be significantly increased, without threatening the sustainability of
the fisheries stock, by broadening participation in the “vessel-day scheme” cooperative agreements to include
East Asian countries with major fishing grounds, such as the Philippines and Indonesia; ensuring compliance with
robust catch limits; allowing easier access to, and trading of, vessel days; and gradually moving to a catch-based
scheme (Box I.B.4).

    Box I.C.1. Exchange Rate Regimes in Developing East Asia and Pacific

    Exchange rate management has been a focus of significant attention in developing EAP since the
    1997–98 Asian financial crisis. With the passage of time, there is now greater consensus on the ultimate
    causes of the crisis.1 In particular, the inflexibility of exchange rate regimes appears to have amplified
    shocks in several of the affected countries: once the crisis was triggered, the decision to defend currencies
    ultimately led to significant losses in output and reserves. Relatedly, market overreaction and herding
    behavior meant that even neighboring countries that were widely regarded as having broadly adequate
    exchange rate frameworks proved vulnerable to contagion.

    Regional currencies could now be again put to the test as global financial condition tighten. The
    region has already been facing significant capital outflows, reflecting the modest global financial tightening
    that has already occurred, but also perceived economic and political risks (Box I.A.3). It is therefore important
    to analyze to what extent exchange rate regimes are contributing to imbalances, as evidenced by sharp real
    exchange rate appreciation or misalignment, and whether countries have sufficient buffers to support the
    selected regime. The analysis here abstracts from the broader issue of the optimal exchange rate regime for
    developing EAP.2

    Developing EAP countries use a wide range of exchange rate regimes, which cover the spectrum
    of available options. Most countries engage to some degree in exchange rate intervention. Nevertheless,
    three broad groups may be identified, drawing on IMF classifications:

         •• Flexible exchange rates. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand all have floating exchange rate
            regimes (Table I.C.1). Similarly, Malaysia’s regime is characterized as “other managed arrangement,”
            but it is generally regarded by analysts and the authorities as lying on the flexible end of the managed
            exchange rate spectrum.3 All these countries were tightly pegged to the U.S. dollar prior to the Asian
            financial crisis (Indonesia had a crawling peg). They were significantly affected by the crisis and, over
            time, have generally moved away from using the exchange rate as an anchor for monetary policy, and
            toward inflation targeting. In addition, Mongolia has had a floating exchange rate regime since 2009,
            and Myanmar can be included in this group following its exchange rate reforms of 2012. In all countries,
            the authorities do intervene to dampen day-to-day volatility in their currencies, but allow them to move
            substantially over longer periods (Klyuev 2016). For instance, in response to the recent appreciation of
            the U.S. dollar, the authorities intervened to limit fluctuations in Mongolia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
            and to a lesser extent, Thailand. But the currency still depreciated in most countries, most strongly in
            Mongolia and Myanmar.



    1	    Key drivers likely included the premature liberalization of capital markets, combined with exchange-rate policies that dramatically reduced perceived volatility. See Corsetti,
          Pesenti, and Roubini (1999) and Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars: Asia Program (2007) for a fuller discussion.
    2	    The existing literature in general discusses the choice of exchange rate regime in terms of the importance of an independent monetary policy, the degree of exchange rate
          risk, and the need for a nominal anchor for monetary policy. Among important arguments for flexibility, exchange rate volatility is often found to have at most small adverse
          effects on trade and on investment (Frankel 1999). Further, even fixed exchange rates are in many cases unable to provide a tight anchor for the price level (Williamson
          1999).

  (Box I.C.1 continued)


       •• Less flexible exchange rates. Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, and Vietnam all have a “stabilized
          arrangement” or “other managed arrangement.” The authorities are heavily involved in setting the
          exchange rate, and intervene frequently to keep the currency within predetermined ranges. In several
          cases, the countries are either de jure or de facto anchoring or pegging to the U.S. dollar or a basket of
          currencies. For instance, over the past year, China intervened significantly to prop up the currency after
          it came under pressure from large capital outflows. In Lao PDR, foreign exchange has been rationed,
          resulting in the emergence of a 3 to 5 percent parallel exchange rate premium. Cambodia and Vietnam,
          however, intervened by purchasing excess foreign currency as strong inflows resulted in appreciation
          pressures.

       •• Fixed exchange rates. The Pacific Island Countries typically either lack their own currency, and instead
          use the U.S. dollar or Australian dollar, or have hard pegs.4

  Exchange rate policies are supported by a relatively frequent use of capital-flow management
  measures across the region, particularly in the large economies. In general, developing EAP has less
  open financial accounts than other regions, with a broad increase in capital-flow management measures since
  the 2000s (IMF 2014). In 2013, Indonesia and Thailand were most open to capital flows; China, Malaysia,
  Myanmar, the Philippines, and Vietnam all had significantly more controls in place.5 In Malaysia, while
  central bank interventions recently moderated, the authorities tightened currency regulations.6 China, after
  some liberalization of bond and stock markets during 2016, intensified restrictions on outward investments
  in early 2017.

  Countries with flexible exchange rates have in general experienced less real appreciation over the
  past few years.7 It is well documented that East Asian economies in general have focused on maintaining
  competitive exchange rates: their “fear of appreciation” is manifested in a willingness to allow depreciations,
  but reluctance to allow appreciations (Rajan 2012). Indeed, among countries with flexible exchange rates,
  only Indonesia has recently experienced significant real appreciation. Appreciating trends in the Philippines
  and Myanmar peaked in early 2015 and mid-2016, respectively, but have since been reversed. Mongolia has
  experienced a rapid loss in the value of its currency, following the rapid appreciation through 2012 and the
  sharp decline in commodity prices since. Conversely, among economies with less flexible or fixed exchange
  rates, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vietnam have all seen continued
  real appreciation. That said, in China, developments since the second half of 2015 have reduced the extent
  of appreciation. And there is no significant appreciation pressure in Fiji, Samoa, or Tonga.

  5	     Countries may be classified as “open” when on average they have capital controls on less than 10 percent over the sample period (1995–2013), and do not have any years
         in which there are controls on more than 20 percent of their transactions subcategories. Countries may be classified as “walls” when they have capital controls on more than
         70 percent of their transactions subcategories over the sample period, and do not have any years in which there are controls on more than 60 percent of their transactions
         subcategories. Countries have “gates” when they are neither open nor walls. During 1995–2013, all the large regional economies had walls or gates, and none were open
         (Fernandez et al. 2015).

         measures to deepen onshore financial markets to ensure liquidity in domestic financial markets.
  7	     Appreciation of the exchange rate is not necessarily a sign of unsustainable policies. Countries can cope with the appreciation provided there are sufficient productivity gains.
         However, prolonged real appreciations can be a signal of misalignment and imbalances.

    (Box I.C.1 continued)


    Experience from across the region suggests that significant exchange rate misalignments can be
    avoided with either flexible or fixed exchange rate regimes, provided these regimes are consistent
    with the overall macroeconomic policy stance. Economies with flexible exchange rates have proved
    broadly successful at avoiding misalignments, with the exchange rate typically assessed as in line with
    fundamentals or moderately undervalued (Table I.C.1). The only exceptions are Myanmar, where the evidence
    points to only moderate overvaluation, and Mongolia. Conversely, a number of countries with less flexible
    or fixed exchange rates have also been able to avoid the build-up of imbalances. In particular, in China,
    Vietnam, and most PICs, there is no clear evidence of misalignment. And in Cambodia and the Solomon
    Islands there is only moderate overvaluation. In contrast, Lao PDR and Papua New Guinea continue to have
    overvalued exchange rates. And managed exchange rate regimes may be able to avoid overvaluation, but
    at the cost of contributing to the build-up of risks in other sectors. For instance, in Cambodia, China, and
    Vietnam, unsterilized foreign exchange intervention likely fueled rapid credit growth.

    Reserve buffers are generally comfortable across the region, regardless of the exchange rate
    regime. Among countries with flexible exchange rates, reserve cover in months of imports significantly
    exceeds standard benchmarks in the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia (Figure I.C.2, panel A).
    However, similarly strong reserve cover exists in countries with less flexible exchange rates, such as China
    and Vanuatu, or with pegs, such as Fiji and Tonga. Conversely, the countries with relatively limited reserve
    cover are equally diverse, including some with flexible exchange rates, such as Myanmar, and others with
    less flexible or fixed exchange rates, such as Lao PDR, Samoa, and Vietnam.8 Again, reserves are relatively
    low as a share of reserve money (panel B) or of foreign currency liabilities (panel C) in economies with both
    flexible exchange rates, such as Mongolia, and less flexible exchange rates, such as Cambodia.

    Ultimately, the presence and extent of imbalances depends not only on the exchange rate regime per
    se, but on the coherence of the overall macroeconomic framework; exchange rate flexibility per se
    is no panacea. Among the large regional economies that were affected by the Asian financial crisis, greater
    exchange rate flexibility has helped preserve competitiveness and maintain adequate reserves. Looking
    ahead, if the U.S. dollar continues appreciating, such flexibility may help maintain trade competitiveness,
    without leading to unmanageable debt servicing costs. Nevertheless, similar outcomes can be achieved with
    less flexible exchange rate arrangements, if these are combined with disciplined fiscal and monetary policies
    (Baig 2001). And several countries in developing EAP, including, in particular, Cambodia and China, have
    indeed been able to avoid imbalances through such discipline. But in other countries, such as Lao PDR
    and Papua New Guinea, significant real appreciation and low reserve buffers suggest that the exchange
    rate regime is not properly aligned with their fiscal and monetary policies. If the U.S. dollar continues
    strengthening, these countries risk further erosion of competitiveness and difficulties in maintaining their
    exchange rate regime.

  Box I.C.2. Productivity Trends in Developing East Asia and Pacific1

  In developing EAP, there is some evidence of a productivity slowdown, but with no consistent
  pattern across countries or over time. Total factor productivity (TFP) measures the efficiency with which
  factors of production are used to produce goods and services, and plays a key role in explaining differences
  in income levels across countries.2 Across the large regional economies, aggregate TFP growth fell sharply
  with the 1997–98 Asian financial crisis (Figure BI.C.2.1, panels A and B). It subsequently broadly recovered,
  but fell again during the global financial crisis (GFC). Since then, it has continued decelerating in China,
  and remains well below pre-GFC levels in Thailand and to a lesser extent Malaysia. In contrast, TFP growth
  has returned to pre-GFC levels in the Philippines and Indonesia, and is rising in Vietnam. Among the small
  economies, TFP growth is well below pre-GFC levels in Cambodia, and remains low in Lao PDR (panel C).

      Note: Estimates based on growth accounting decomposition. An aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function is assumed, with physical capital, labor, and human capital as inputs.
      Physical capital is estimated using the perpetual inventory method. Human capital is estimated based on average years of schooling and Mincer rates of return to education. This
      decomposition measures the proximate sources of growth, but TFP levels, and their differences across sectors, ultimately affect output growth also by changing the incentives to
      accumulate both physical and human capital.



  Similarly, the pace of structural transformation has decelerated in some but not all countries, broadly
  in line with aggregate productivity trends. The reallocation of labor toward sectors enjoying higher
  productivity (“static reallocation”) or faster productivity growth (“dynamic reallocation”), and in particular
  from agriculture toward manufacturing, construction, and non-traditional services, was for extended periods
  an important channel underpinning aggregate productivity gains in the region.3 However, this transformation

    has stalled in Thailand, and its pace remains weak in Malaysia and the Philippines since the Asian financial
    crisis (Figure BI.C.2.2). In contrast, the pace of labor reallocation is increasing in Indonesia, and remained
    robust in China through 2010. In Vietnam, detailed studies suggest that intersectoral reallocation continues
    to account for approximately half of labor productivity growth, with no signs of a slowdown.4

     Note: Aggregate labor productivity growth is decomposed as follows:
                                                                                         n                    n                   n

      here P and p denote, respectively, economy-wide and sectoral labor productivity; Θ denotes sectoral employment shares; the subscripts i and t refer, respectively, to the sector and year; and the Δ operator
     w
     denotes changes over time. The first term on the right-hand side captures the impact of within-sector productivity growth; the second and third terms capture the impact of structural reallocation, that is,
     shifts toward sectors with higher initial productivity (“static reallocation,” the second term), or higher productivity growth (“dynamic reallocation,” the third term) (de Vries et al. 2015). The analysis employs
     data on value added at constant prices, and on employment, for the following 10 sectors: agriculture, hunting and forestry, and fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, and water
     supply; construction; wholesale and retail trade, hotels, and restaurants; transport, storage, and communications; finance, insurance, real estate, and business services; government services; and community,
     social, and personal services. Data are available for the following periods: China, 1952–2010; Indonesia, 1961–2012; Malaysia, 1975–2011; the Philippines, 1971–2012; and Thailand, 1960–2011.



    Large productivity differences across firms suggest that resource misallocation may have a significant
    impact on aggregate productivity. Additional insights may be gained from the firm-level productivity
    data in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. Much of the following discussion focuses on labor productivity,
    since estimating TFP at the firm level is challenging.5 Average labor productivity in both manufacturing and
    services is in general correlated with output per capita. But several regional economies, including China,
    Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, are characterized by significant differences in productivity across
    firms, in both manufacturing (Figure BI.C.2.3, panel A) and services (panel B).6 The continued survival of a
    large number of underperforming firms may be indicative of capital-, labor-, or product-market distortions
    constraining relatively more efficient producers.7 These differentials might reflect differences across firms in
    the capital intensity and technology intensity of production, as measured by the ratio of sales to labor costs
    (panels C and D).

    5	       Among the key technical difficulties, differences across firms in TFP are likely to be correlated with firms’ choice of inputs, as well as with the (typically unmeasured) price
             deflators for firms’ inputs and outputs.

    Firm-level productivity is significantly influenced by several aspects of the business environment.
    In general, a wide range of factors is correlated with firm-level productivity; whether there is a causal link is
    less clear. That said, formal-sector firms across the region repeatedly refer to specific key constraints to their
    activities, including access to finance, tax rates, political instability, corruption, an inadequately educated
    workforce, and competition from the informal sector (Table BI.C.2.1). And, indeed, labor productivity is
    lower among firms that self-report such constraints, or that can be objectively identified as being affected
    by them (see, for instance, Figure BI.C.2.4, panels A, B, C, and D).

    Quantitatively, addressing shortages of skills and infrastructure can significantly improve firm
    performance. In Malaysia, firms that find adequate labor more easily are 16 percent more productive (Figure
    BI.C.2.5). In that context, not just education systems but also firm-level training programs have an impact.8
    Firms that offer formal training opportunities are 23 percent more productive in Malaysia, 30 percent more
    productive in Cambodia, and 130 percent more productive in Myanmar. Again, improving infrastructure
    yields a significant payoff: in Malaysia, firms that do not experience power outages are 50 percent more
    productive.

    Likewise, productivity is associated with easier access to credit, especially among small and medium
    enterprises (SMEs), and with focus on innovation. Firms that are not financially constrained expand
    employment much more rapidly in the Philippines (Figure BI.C.2.6, Panel A), and enjoy higher labor
    productivity in Vietnam (Panel B). Access to credit is especially challenging for SMEs and for longer-term
    financing. However, it could be boosted by measures to strengthen creditor and property rights, improve
    credit information systems, and enhance financial supervision and regulation.9 Again, innovative firms are
    more productive. In Vietnam, firms that invest in formal R&D create three times more jobs, and see much
    faster sales growth (Figure BI.C.2.7).

     Note: Firms are defined as fully credit-constrained if they cannot obtain any form of external financing. They typically fall into two categories: (a) those that applied for a loan and were rejected; and (b)
     those that did not apply either because of unfavorable terms and conditions, or because they did not think their application would be approved. Firms are defined as partially credit-constrained if they
     have external financing but (a) were discouraged from applying for a loan from a financial institution; or (b) applied for a loan that was partially approved or rejected. For an analysis of the impact of these
     financial constraints, see Kuntchev et al. (2014).

  Box I.C.3. The Investment Slowdown in Developing East Asia and Pacific1


  Long-term investment trends in developing EAP

  Investment rates in developing EAP since the 1997–98 Asian financial crisis have been significantly
  higher than in other developing regions (    Figure BI.C.3.1, panels A and B). Developing EAP accounted
  for almost 20 percent of global investment, and more than 40 percent of global investment growth, during
  2000–16 (panels C and D). These high investment rates led to a rapid accumulation of physical capital and
  expansion of productive capacity, and contributed to the region’s rapid GDP growth. In China and Vietnam,
  investment was the main source of GDP growth, accounting for about half of GDP growth between 2004 and
  2010. In the rest of the region, investment growth contributed about 1.3 percentage points, or about one-
  quarter of the 4.9 percent annual GDP growth during the same period. The high investment levels reflect
  rapid growth in private investment, which proved resilient to shocks.

    Investment in developing EAP was largely supported by high domestic saving rates, but foreign
    capital also played an important role. Domestic savings in developing EAP have been significantly higher
    than in other developing regions (Figure BI.C.3.2). East Asia is the only developing region in which savings
    have consistently exceeded investment, making it a net exporter of capital: since the Asian crisis of 1997–
    98, the region has recorded current account surpluses averaging around 4 percent of GDP. That said, foreign
    capital played an important role in various key aspects of investment growth in developing EAP, including
    transfer of new technologies and know-how, formation of human resources, integration in global markets,
    increase of competition, and firms’ development and reorganization (Moura and Forte 2010). Developing
    EAP has been successful in attracting a large share of global FDI in the postcrisis period (Figure BI.C.3.3,
    panel A). FDI stocks were significant in both large and small economies (panels B and C).

  Investment trends since 2010

  In Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) as a whole, investment growth has slowed
  sharply since 2010. Investment growth declined from 10 percent in 2010 to 3.4 percent in 2015 (Figure
  BI.C.3.4, panels A, B, and C). The slowdown affected most economies: in 2015, investment growth was below
  its long-term average in more than 60 percent of EMDEs, the largest share over the past quarter century
  outside serious global downturns. Postcrisis investment weakness affected both public investment, which
  accounted for 31 percent of investment during 2010–15, and private investment. In all regions except Sub-
  Saharan Africa, public investment growth has slowed steadily from elevated levels during the global financial
  crisis to below long-term averages. This slowdown partly reflected increasing financing constraints as fiscal
  space eroded with crisis-related fiscal stimulus and slowing postcrisis growth. Following a postcrisis rebound
  in 2010, private investment growth also slowed sharply and remained below the long-term average in more
  than half of all EMDEs. Developments have varied widely across regions, however, reflecting the presence of
  commodity importers or exporters, the degree of political stability, and spillovers from key trading partners
  and investors. Since 2010, investment growth has declined particularly sharply, and in some cases even
  proved negative, in regions with a large number of commodity exporters, notably in Europe and Central
  Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

  Investment growth in developing EAP has steadily declined, but less so than in developing economies
  as a whole, and its pace has stabilized since 2015. Regional investment growth declined from 12.1 percent
  in 2010 to 6.5 percent on average in 2015–16. The slowdown affected most regional economies, and was
  particularly pronounced in China (Figure BI.C.3.4, panels D and E). It reflected decelerating public and private
  investment growth, as the coordinated fiscal stimulus following the global financial crisis was unwound. As
  a result, in many developing EAP economies, investment and savings rates have peaked well before their
  incomes reached advanced economy levels, in contrast with the experience of the current high-income East
  Asian economies. China is an exception: its investment rate and the contribution of its investment to growth
  remain elevated, exceeding 40 percent in 2016 (Figure BI.C.3.5, panel A). In commodity exporters in the
  region, investment growth slowed particularly sharply during 2012–14. Since 2015, investment growth has
  stabilized or begun to recover in several countries (Figure BI.C.3.5, panels B and C). Overall, investment
  growth in developing EAP was approximately twice as high as in other developing regions during 2013–16.

  Much of the regional investment decline is accounted for by decreases in construction investment
  and, to a lesser extent, machinery and equipment investment. Construction investment accounts for well
  over half of total investment (of which around one-third is residential construction investment). Machinery
  and equipment investment spending has had a less pronounced cycle. The small “other investment” category,
  which is mainly breeding livestock and intangibles, has been broadly constant at around 1 percent of GDP.

  the oil price decline from 2014 onward accounted for about half of the investment slowdown during 2011–
  15. In commodity importers, slowing FDI inflows accounted on average for more than half of the investment
  slowdown. Rising private debt burdens have had increasingly adverse effects on investment, as the impact
  of a large “debt-overhang”2 is compounded by an environment with weak growth prospects. High or rising
  political uncertainty, as measured by the International Country Risk Guide’s political risk index, may have
  accounted for one-tenth of the investment slowdown since 2011: when firms are uncertain about future
  demand or policies, they may not be willing to commit to irreversible physical investment.3 The institutional
  and regulatory environment remains critical: postcrisis, private investment recovered faster in countries with
  more developed financial market infrastructure, and with generally better governance.4

  In developing EAP, and especially in China, slowing investment growth partly represents a correction
  from high precrisis investment growth and the immediate postcrisis fiscal and monetary stimulus.
  China and several ASEAN countries experienced rapid credit growth in the postcrisis period. Large debt
  stocks now continue to weigh on investment growth in China, Malaysia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, and
  Thailand. Relatedly, investment efficiency, as measured by incremental capital-output ratios (ICORs), has
  been deteriorating until recently. In China, ICORs were particularly high, reflecting large investment in
  infrastructure and real estate.

    Regional commodity exporters have been significantly affected by terms-of-trade declines, and
    regional commodity importers by policy tightening. In large commodity exporters (Indonesia and
    Malaysia), investment was significantly affected by two factors: the decline in commodity prices (especially
    raw materials, fertilizers, metals, and minerals) from their early-2011 peaks; and related policy tightening,
    particularly in response to financial volatility during the 2013 “Taper Tantrum.” In smaller, more heavily
    commodity-dependent economies, including Mongolia and Papua New Guinea, investment contracted as
    FDI for mining-sector projects declined, and as domestic policies again tightened sharply in response to
    balance-of-payments stress. Regional commodity importers other than China, until 2015, faced investment
    headwinds from tight monetary, fiscal, and prudential policies that were designed to contain the previous
    rapid credit growth. Their effects were compounded by political uncertainty in Thailand, and delays in
    investment project approvals in the Philippines.

    The more recent stabilization of investment in the region broadly reflects stabilizing commodity
    prices, reduced policy tightening, and lower political uncertainty. Investment has been encouraged by
    stabilizing commodity prices (for commodity exporters); more accommodative policies, amid low inflation
    and benign global financial conditions; and buoyant FDI. In Thailand, investment growth is recovering amid
    improved confidence. Public investment has accelerated particularly sharply in the Philippines, and in China
    it has offset the continued moderation of private investment.

  Box I.C.4. Food Prices and the Poor in Indonesia and the Philippines1

  The poor are vulnerable to higher prices, especially for rice and other staple foods. With low and
  vulnerable incomes, and a limited ability to smooth consumption out of savings, the poor are particularly
  susceptible to sharp increases in the cost of living. The poor spend more on food than on anything else—it
  makes up 60 percent of total consumption in Indonesia and up to 70 percent in the Philippines (Figure
  BI.C.4.1). Within food consumption, rice is the main staple of both countries and by far the highest single
  expenditure, representing around 15 to 20 percent of all consumption for the extreme and moderate poor.2
  Moreover, rice prices in both countries are considerably higher than world prices. The price in the Philippines
  is twice that in Thailand and Vietnam, while Indonesian prices are around a third higher than world prices.

      Note: The extreme poor are approximated by the poorest per capita decile in the consumption
      distribution in each country, living on less than US$1.90 per person per day (in purchasing power

      deciles, living on less than US$3.10 per person per day.




  As a consequence, the poverty rate is sensitive to food price increases. For example, in 2006, the
  national poverty rate increased by nearly 2 percentage points in Indonesia, the first such increase since the
  Asian Financial Crisis, and the only increase in the last 17 years (Figure BI.C.4.2). This was largely attributed
  to a 33 percent increase in rice prices due to an import ban.3 Moreover, the slowing of poverty reduction in
  Indonesia in recent years has been due in part to continued high food price inflation.4 In the Philippines,
  during the 2008–09 food price crisis, the 35 to 40 percent increase in rice prices was seen as driving the

    2.5 percentage point increase in poverty.5 A 10 percent increase in food prices in the Philippines has been
    estimated to lead to a 2.7 percentage point increase in poverty.6

    Higher food prices affect both urban and rural households. The urban poor and vulnerable are affected
    by higher food prices when supplies are tight. However, most rural households are also affected, even those
    with some farming income. Most poor households are net rice consumers; even poor farmers generally
    consume more rice than they produce. This is true in both Indonesia7 and the Philippines.8 In fact, due to the
    larger number of rural households living just above the poverty line compared to urban areas, poverty
    during the 2007–08 food price crisis increased by 5.2 percentage points in rural areas, higher than the
    4.5 percentage point increase in urban areas.9

    In Indonesia, rice-price stabilization policies have been relatively ineffective in containing price
    increases. A ban on rice imports led directly to the food price crisis of 2006 and the consequent increase
    in poverty. Imports have since resumed, conducted solely by the government logistics agency, which uses
    imports to supplement purchases from local producers to maintain rice stocks. The agency then conducts
    market operations, releasing stocks into local markets when rice prices are high, according to a set formula.
    However, market operations have been relatively small (equivalent to less than 1 percent of rice production),
    are often conducted with delays, and have been through large traders who may not pass lower prices onto
    consumers. Consequently, they have historically proved ineffective at containing prices.10 Further, the way
    market operations are conducted often provides signals to the market, which contribute to price volatility.
    Informed traders watch government stocks and import announcements, often choosing to restrict sales in
    the expectation that prices will rise in the short term.11

    In the Philippines, over the past decades, a policy focus on rice self-sufficiency has led to an
    inadequate rice supply, and domestic rice prices significantly greater than world prices. Rice imports
    are controlled by the National Food Authority.12 Restrictions on, and the mistiming of, imports have caused
    several price hikes;13 in general, low rice stocks are clearly associated with increases in rice prices (Figure
    BI.C.4.3). At the same time, substantial but poorly planned and executed government investments have

  2015 and March 2016, and channeled 177,000
  tons through market operations. As a consequence,
  rice and food price inflation remained relatively low, and March 2016 saw the first significant reduction
  in poverty in three years.16 However, this recently improved effectiveness in rice stabilization relies upon
  continued political commitment. Nationalist economic sentiments and arguments to increase self-sufficiency
  through import restrictions remain common in the public discourse. A return to lower imports (or poorer
  import timing) owing to changes in leadership or in views would put the new price stability at risk.

  Inflation remains moderate but has recently been increasing in the Phlippines and Indonesia, with
  risks for poverty. In the Philippines, food prices have been rising at around 3.5 percent (year-on-year),
  driven in part by higher rice prices (Figure BI.C.4.4). Continued food-price increases could threaten the
  poor.17 In Indonesia, food-price inflation remains lower than in recent years, owing to substantially lower
  rice price inflation. However, increases in regulated prices (electricity and government services) and the
  gradual recovery of global commodity prices are driving inflation higher (Figure BI.C.4.5).18 If significant
  food price inflation also materializes, this could have significant adverse effects on poverty.

  To meet growing rice demand and help contain prices, a liberalization of rice imports should be
  complemented by measures to boost agricultural productivity and enhance logistics. The world rice
  market is relatively thin: only 6 to 7 percent of total global rice production is traded internationally.19
  This leaves importing countries vulnerable to aggregate shocks in regional exporters such as Vietnam and

    Thailand. However, in both Indonesia and the Philippines, there is significant scope to both raise domestic
    agricultural productivity and lower the cost of transportation; this will help to both lower food prices and
    boost incomes. Specifically, Indonesian farm productivity is low for several reasons.20 Farms are smaller
    than in Thailand and the Philippines, making them less efficient and impeding mechanization; Indonesia is
    characterized by higher labor intensity than China, India, the Philippines, Thailand, or Vietnam. Productivity
    is also restricted by poor infrastructure (including irrigation, water resources, and road access to market),
    low use of high-yielding seeds, low agricultural research spending, and limited titling (needed for bank loan
    collateral). In the Philippines, the rice supply chain has high milling, drying, and transportation and storage
    costs, reflecting insufficient investments in roads and postharvest facilities, policy distortions, and a lack of
    competition.21

    At the same time, effective social protection is needed for times of shock. In addition to improved
    productivity and logistics, effective social protection programs are needed to protect the poor and vulnerable
    from food price shocks in times of domestic or international natural disasters. Domestic and imported
    supplies of rice and other foods can easily be disrupted by droughts, floods, and other climate events.
    Ensuring that poor and vulnerable households have a safety net in times of high food prices remains critical,
    particularly in urban areas where the recent migrants and other urban poor often lack the strong informal
    coping mechanisms relied upon in rural areas, such as borrowing from friends and family.

II.A.	 Boosting Labor Mobility in the ASEAN Economic Community1
           Greater trade integration among ASEAN countries will create significant new economic opportunities.
           The ability of both high- and low-skilled workers to move freely across ASEAN countries will be an
           important determinant of whether these new opportunities are in fact seized. Existing commitments
           by ASEAN member states to facilitate international labor mobility are limited in scope, and progress
           putting them into action has likewise been limited. As a result, significant barriers to labor mobility
           persist, reflecting weaknesses in the migration systems of both migrant-receiving and migrant-sending
           countries. Immigration regimes frequently do not reflect economic needs; information asymmetries
           among recruitment agencies, migrants, and employers result in high recruitment costs; entry and exit
           requirements are time-consuming and costly; and information about overseas employment opportunities
           is often lacking. To boost labor mobility, migrant-receiving countries should work toward migration
           systems that are responsive to economic needs. Sending countries should balance protection for migrant

           strengthen connections to diasporas. And greater coordination is required between receiving and sending
           countries. Specific measures to support this agenda include developing national migration strategies
           to guide policy making, shortage lists to inform immigration restrictions and link them to economic
           needs, predeparture orientation programs, better oversight of recruitment agencies, a combination of
           sanctions and incentives to encourage return migration , and more comprehensive and flexible bilateral
           labor agreements.




Economic integration and international labor mobility

Economic integration in ASEAN has the potential to spur economic growth in the region. ASEAN has
been working toward regional integration for several decades through a series of agreements designed to tie the
economies of member states more closely together. In part due to these efforts, intraregional tariffs have declined
significantly and intraregional trade has increased to account for about a quarter of the region’s world trade
(Figure II.A.1). However, regional integration is not complete. Nontariff barriers remain an issue (OECD 2016), and
trade in services is still constrained by restrictive policies (ASEAN Secretariat and World Bank 2015). Removing the
remaining barriers to integration would significantly boost GDP, exports, and total employment (Figure II.A.2; ILO
and ADB 2014). Further integration would also hasten structural change in several countries.

The ability of workers to move freely across countries and access newly created jobs will be an important
determinant of whether the new economic opportunities created by integration are in fact seized. Reaping
the full benefits of economic integration in ASEAN will require significant shifts in employment across countries and
sectors. Conversely, barriers to labor mobility, which reduce the ability of workers to react to economic changes,
will erode the positive effects of integration and diminish welfare. This chapter focuses on barriers to international
labor mobility, such as rigid immigration systems or high international recruitment costs, which can dissuade

potential migrants from moving abroad or lead to undocumented migration. Barriers to domestic labor mobility2
are largely beyond the scope of the analysis, although they interact with and reinforce barriers to international
mobility, and in addition make it more difficult for domestic workers to adjust to the entry of immigrant workers.

The commitments made by ASEAN member states to facilitate labor mobility, as part of efforts to promote
deeper regional integration, have been limited in scope. The most ambitious efforts have targeted high-skilled
workers, partly in recognition that their mobility is critical to services integration. The 1995 ASEAN Framework
Agreement on Services provided for the temporary movement of skilled professionals across borders, in line with
the World Trade Organization General Agreement on Trade in Services Mode 4 provisions, with mobility-related
commitments later collected in the ASEAN Agreement on Movement of Natural Persons (Figure II.A.3). One of the
five pillars of the AEC, which envisions deeper economic integration and trade within ASEAN through the creation
of a single market, is the free movement of skilled workers along with the free movement of goods, services,
and investment and the freer flow of capital. In laying out the vision for the AEC in 2003, ASEAN member states
pledged to “facilitate movement of business persons, skilled labor and talents,” and then laid out specific actions
for doing so in the 2007 AEC Blueprint, such as facilitating the issuance of visas and employment passes for ASEAN
professionals and skilled workers. In contrast, efforts to facilitate the mobility of low-skilled workers have been
much more limited. The 2007 Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers (the
Cebu Declaration) set out the obligations of migrant-receiving countries, including promoting fair employment; of

sending countries, including regulating recruitment; and of ASEAN itself, including data sharing, capacity building,
and developing an instrument for the protection and promotion of migrant workers’ rights.3

There has been limited progress putting into action these commitments to facilitate labor mobility. ASEAN
member states have formulated mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) in seven professions and a framework
agreement in an eighth. The MRAs take steps toward the creation of regional certification authorities and of
processes for professionals to work abroad. Many ASEAN countries have made progress in areas like recruitment,
migrant orientation programs, and complaints mechanisms for low-skilled workers. However, progress has been
limited and barriers to international labor mobility remain. The MRAs only cover an estimated 5 percent of
employment in ASEAN (Batalova, Shymonyak, and Sugiyarto 2017). Host country immigration and regulatory
restrictions remain in place even where MRAs have been implemented. For example, Thailand bans migrants from
working in 39 occupations including engineering, accounting, and architecture, which are covered by MRAs. The
Cebu Declaration remains unratified in member states and is not binding (Martin and Abella 2014; Asia-Pacific
RCM Thematic Working Group 2015).




The implications of labor mobility for worker welfare

Lowering barriers to mobility would increase the welfare gains enjoyed by workers in ASEAN countries
following economic integration. Models of trade integration can be expanded to recognize that adjustments
to trade shocks can be disrupted by the costs workers face when trying to move across countries, sectors, and
occupations (Hollweg et al. 2014). This expansion permits exploration of how worker outcomes are affected by
barriers workers face to moving in response to the new economic opportunities created by integration. When
barriers to mobility are relaxed for skilled workers, as the AEC currently envisions, economic modeling shows
that trade integration has a substantially larger positive effect across all ASEAN countries than if skilled workers
continue to face high barriers to movement (Figure II.A.4).4 In ASEAN, the effect of enhanced trade integration on
welfare is 14 percent higher if such barriers are reduced. When barriers to mobility are reduced for all workers in
ASEAN, the positive effects of trade integration are even higher across ASEAN countries (Figure II.A.5). In ASEAN,
the effect of enhanced trade integration on welfare is 29 percent higher if barriers to mobility for all workers are
reduced rather than those for high-skilled workers alone.5 These results suggest that further trade integration
without reducing barriers to mobility would leave significant welfare gains unrealized.

Welfare gains from improved mobility can manifest themselves in a variety of ways. Welfare is typically
measured using employment, wages, and other variables such as the potential to move to different jobs for higher
wages, which impact a worker’s well-being. The growing body of literature on the impacts of migration on workers




3	   The ASEAN Forum on Migrant Labor promotes implementation of the Cebu Declaration.
4	   Enhanced trade integration within ASEAN is modeled as the removal of remaining intraregional tariffs, the liberalization of nontariff barriers in goods and services, and the introduction
     of advanced trade facilitation measures. The model underpinning these simulations, unlike standard trade models, does not assume that workers can change jobs without friction:
     mobility between countries, sectors, and occupations is possible but costly.
5	   ASEAN is a diverse region, characterized by significant cross-country differences in technologies and productivity. As a result, international trade and migration are likely to prove
     complementary. That is, the gains from trade between ASEAN countries are likely to increase when migration is liberalized. And, conversely, flows of workers across borders in ASEAN
     are likely to continue even as trade integration proceeds. Indeed, two other globally important regional trade blocs that included mobility-liberalizing provisions, the European Union
     and the North American Free Trade Agreement, both experienced increases in international migration following integration, although these increases were temporary.

Migration generally improves the welfare of workers in migrant-receiving countries through positive,
though small, impacts on employment and wages. Most evidence globally finds that migration has small
impacts on the labor market outcomes of locals. Docquier, Özden, and Peri (2014) finds that immigration to OECD
countries in the 1990s had positive, but small, impacts on wages and employment. Results are generally small
in East Asian countries, as well (Ahsan et al. 2014). In Malaysia, immigration to a given state has been found to
increase the employment of local workers. An additional 10 immigrants in a state results in the employment of
an additional 5 locals in that state as Malaysian workers relocate (Figure II.A.6). Impacts on wages are small and
positive for local workers but larger and negative for existing migrants (Özden and Wagner 2016). These results
suggest that cheaper immigrant workers lower production costs, which results in expansions of output that in turn
require expansions of employment.

However, migration can negatively affect the welfare of certain groups of workers in destination countries,
particularly the low skilled. The positive impacts of immigration on employment found in Malaysia are smaller
for the least educated locals who, unlike the more highly educated, compete directly with immigrants. Similarly,
the impact of immigration on wages is small and positive for local workers overall but negative for local workers
with at most primary education. In Thailand, doubling the size of the immigrant workforce in five provinces would
increase the wages of local workers with high school and college education by about half a percent but decrease
them for less-educated workers (Figure II.A.7).

Domestic barriers to mobility shape how migration impacts the welfare of workers in destination countries.
Local workers who face rigid labor markets and have a difficult time switching jobs, firms, and geographic locations
have trouble taking advantage of and adjusting to the presence of immigrant workers. In Europe, there is evidence
that immigration to more rigid labor markets characterized by high firing costs, rigid wages, and high business
entry costs results in more job losses among locals than immigration to more flexible labor markets (Angrist and
Kugler 2003). The disruptive effects of rigid labor markets on adjustment to immigration were also found in
Germany in the 1990s, although there it was existing migrants who suffered employment losses due to rigid wages
(D’Amuri, Ottaviano, and Peri 2010).

Migrants themselves benefit significantly from migration, as do the recipients of their remittances.
Migrating workers gain because of the large wage differentials between source and destination countries.6 And
their remittances boost the budgets of recipient households in migrant-sending countries, relax credit constraints,
act as insurance against shocks, and help smooth consumption.

Out-migration generally improves the welfare of workers in sending countries. The out-migration
of significant numbers of migrant workers from sending countries can result in a contraction of labor supply,
which reduces competition and increases the wages of non-migrant workers who remain in the source country. A
10 percent decrease in workers in a given skill group in Mexico from out-migration increased average wages by
about 4 percent (Mishra 2007); similar increases have been found in Poland, Moldova, Puerto Rico, and Honduras
(Mishra 2014).

Concerns about “brain drain” are often overstated; “brain circulation” may more accurately describe the
process of high-skilled emigration. Source countries frequently worry that “brain drain”, that is, the departure
of high-skilled workers for employment abroad, has negative effects. These include the fiscal burden of paying
for training that is ultimately used abroad, and depletion of the human capital behind technological upgrading,
adaptation, and ultimately economic growth. However, standard analyses may significantly overestimate the extent
of brain drain: for instance, almost half of African-born doctors who practice in the United States were trained
outside their country of birth, and many African doctors migrate after years of service in their home country (Özden
and Philipps 2015). Further, high-skilled emigration may incentivize human capital formation by increasing the
perceived returns to migration and encouraging stayers to invest more in education (Beine, Docquier, and Rapoport
2008). In addition, migrants who return may earn a wage premium compared to nonmigrants, while those who
remain abroad can reduce the costs of transferring knowledge, ideas, and capital, resulting in broader impacts on
trade and FDI flows and even on political institutions (Docquier and Rapoport 2012).

International migration can also have broader positive impacts on economies. The impact of international
mobility on economic growth is important because it determines whether those who gain from migration can
compensate those who lose out (Felbermayr and Kohler 2009). In Malaysia, simulations find that a 10 percent net
increase in low-skilled immigrant workers increases real GDP by 1.1 percent (Ahsan et al. 2014). The migrants
keep salaries low, reducing domestic prices and production costs and increasing export growth, with the result
that unskilled employment and profits increase, which leads to increased investment and demand for (mostly
Malaysian) skilled workers. Research in Thailand finds that removing migrants from the labor force would reduce
GDP by 0.75 percent. Tight labor markets and some skills complementarity between the skills of local and migrant
workers are important factors explaining these results. More general research has found that immigration into
countries with high income and/or net inward migration, including Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, and Singapore,
does not impact economic growth in the same decade but has positive long-run impacts on the growth in GDP per
capita, likely due to increases in total factor productivity (Brunow, Nijkamp, and Poot 2015).




Barriers to labor mobility in ASEAN

ASEAN’s diverse levels of economic development attract workers to seek employment abroad. ASEAN
countries vary significantly in their economic development. This is reflected, as mentioned, in large wage
differentials among countries, which mean that migrants can seek out more highly paid jobs by moving across
borders. Indeed, ASEAN’s main immigration magnets are the high-income countries of the region—Singapore,
Malaysia, and Thailand—while the region’s low-income countries tend to be senders of migrants. Migration from
countries with lower GDPs per capita to countries with higher GDPs per capita dominates ASEAN’s major migration
corridors (Table II.A.1). An additional factor in the movement of people for employment in ASEAN is the different
rates of population aging in the region. Working-age populations in Singapore, Thailand, and, to a lesser extent,
Malaysia will shrink in the coming decades, creating employment opportunities for migrants from countries with
younger populations. In 2015, Singapore and Thailand had much older median ages than all of the main countries
from which they received migrants (Figure II.A.8).

However, barriers to labor mobility prevent some people from moving while leading others to seek out
informal channels. The poorest households may not be able to migrate because of the costliness of international
migration. Indeed, there is evidence of an inverse “U-shaped” relationship between migration and wealth, with the
least wealthy households unable to finance migration and the wealthiest households unwilling to migrate because
of the high opportunity costs of doing so (McKenzie and Rapoport 2007). When barriers to mobility using formal
migration processes are too high, migrants seek out informal channels using informal labor brokers to pass borders
unofficially, entering countries to work with nonwork visas, and overstaying employment passes. Undocumented
migration is significant in ASEAN, though data limitations and the difficulty of defining undocumented migration
make an accurate assessment difficult. The long and porous borders between Thailand and Cambodia, Lao PDR,
and Myanmar, and between Malaysia and Indonesia, make these receiving countries particularly susceptible to
undocumented migration. About 60 percent of migration from Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar to Thailand
is undocumented and around half of the migrant population in Malaysia is undocumented (Huguet 2014; World
Bank 2015).

International labor mobility costs capture and quantify the barriers to labor mobility that may prevent
some migrants from moving and lead others to choose informal channels. Labor mobility costs quantify
the costs from restrictive migration policies, documentation costs, and recruitment fees, as well as the cost of
job searches and rigid employment policies. The overall costs faced by workers moving internationally can be
approximated by comparing observed wage differences between jobs, a measure of their attractiveness, with data
on actual job flows.7 For instance, a country with very high wages but few workers observed moving to work in it
implies very high labor mobility costs. In other words, labor mobility costs can be estimated by comparing how well
workers are able to respond to signals—high wages—of economic opportunity.

ASEAN’s predominantly migrant-sending countries
often have restrictions on immigrants, including high-
skilled ones, which is reflected in their higher mobility costs. Given the nature of the estimation, comparing labor
mobility costs across countries is more informative than focusing on absolute magnitudes.8

High international mobility costs in ASEAN have important consequences for how workers can respond to
economic changes. Workers in ASEAN face costs at least several times their average annual wage to move abroad
for employment; as a result, they may forego large potential wage gains (Hollweg et al. 2014).




Policies to decrease labor mobility costs

Weaknesses in ASEAN migration systems result in higher international mobility costs. Migration systems
seek to reconcile the often conflicting demands of receiving countries that need both low- and high-skilled migrants
to fill labor shortages, of employers in receiving countries that use migrants to fill shortages but whose objective is
profit maximization rather than economic growth, of sending countries that benefit from remittances and reduced
unemployment, and of migrants themselves who benefit from employment opportunities and higher wages. The
migration system can generally be broken down into the legal and institutional framework organizing the system;
the rules that govern the admissions, employment, and return of migrant workers; and the enforcement of those
rules. Weaknesses and breakdowns in the migration system can be grouped into five major problem areas which
increase the cost for migrants of seeking employment abroad (Figure II.A.10):

    •• Migration systems frequently have difficulty responding to economic needs. Restrictions on the number of
       migrants a country can receive are often not aligned with economic needs. For instance, the foreign worker
       levy that Malaysia uses to control the number of immigrant workers has been left unadjusted for significant
       periods, such as between 1999 and 2005, 2005 and 2009, and 2011 and 2016. When changes to the levy
       have been announced, employers frequently express surprise, which has twice led to adjustments to the
       policies after their public announcement.

    •• Information asymmetries exist among migrants, employers, and recruitment agencies. Though efforts
       have been undertaken in migrant-sending countries to increase the information available to migrants and
       to regulate the recruitment industry, migrants remain dependent on recruitment agencies and informal
       labor brokers, which means that recruitment costs remain high. For instance, in Indonesia, labor brokers,
       which are unregulated, often play an important role in identifying and providing information to potential
       migrants, which can drive up costs and subject migrants to abuse.

    •• Relatedly, employers and recruitment agencies are able to exploit information asymmetries to extract
       rents from the migration system. Labor brokers can capture a significant portion of the difference in wages
       between sending and receiving countries simply for connecting employers and migrant workers (Ahsan et
       al. 2014).

    •• There is a lack of coordination among sending and receiving countries, employers, trade unions and
       workers, and migrants. As a result, entry procedures are often cumbersome, and include redundant
       documentation requirements from multiple agencies. Though some bilateral agreements have been
       formulated to coordinate migration between sending and receiving countries, those agreements frequently
       suffer from weaknesses such as lack of transparency and lack of input from employers and migrants. In
       the case of Thailand’s memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar,

          the formal migration channels created by the MOUs were overly bureaucratic and very time-consuming for
          migrants (ILO 2015).

      •• Finally, both sending and receiving countries tend to focus on the short-term benefits and costs of
         migration. Thailand, in particular, has struggled to formulate a long-term migration strategy, instead using
         regularizations of undocumented migrants as a de facto migration policy. In recent years, sending countries
         have begun to give more consideration to the employment and development impacts of emigration.
         However, programs to support returning migrants and to connect with diasporas are in their infancy.

ASEAN countries can implement policies to reduce the labor mobility costs arising from weaknesses in
each component of the migration system. The appropriate policies will vary across countries, depending on
whether they send or receive migrants, the maturity of their migration management system, and their level of
development. Nevertheless, the following broad principles apply.


ÌÌGovernance

ASEAN countries should consider developing national migration strategies to guide policy making in both
the short and long term. Such a strategy can provide clarity to employers and other labor market stakeholders in
primarily receiving countries about the official view on immigrant workers and how policy is likely to impact their
numbers and characteristics. The plan can also acknowledge potential negative impacts of immigration on some

SUSTAINING RESILIENCE




workers and clarify efforts to assist those who are made worse off. In primarily sending countries, migration strategies
can elaborate on how policy makers plan to balance protections for migrants while they are abroad with efforts
to link out-migration to economic development. In both sending and receiving countries, the national migration
strategy should be comprehensive in covering all aspects of migration, organizing institutional responsibilities,
and coordinating migration policy with employment, education, and skill strategies.

Bilateral agreements are important tools for increasing cooperation between sending and receiving
countries. These agreements can provide the basis for sending and receiving countries to reconcile interests and
align their legislative and institutional frameworks. Stakeholder engagement, transparency, and monitoring and
evaluation are important components of good bilateral agreements and MOUs. The success of an agreement depends
on its ability to adjust to emerging labor market needs, continued engagement between sending and receiving
country representatives, and the complementarity of national migration and employment frameworks (KNOMAD
2014). Model employment contracts, wage protection measures such as mechanisms for automatic deposit of
wages into migrant’s bank accounts, transparency about the contents of MOUs, involvement of public employment
services in sending and receiving countries, inclusion of gender-specific issues, and concrete implementation and
evaluation measures are all good practices in bilateral agreements and MOUs (Wickramasekara 2015). These
practices can lower migration costs by improving the information available to migrant workers, particularly about
their contracts, working conditions, and rights.


ÌÌAdmissions

The admissions process should be transparent with entry paths that are clearly differentiated. Application
processes that are confusing and opaque create inefficiencies, increase migration costs, and lead to doubts about
the integrity of the admissions process. Transparency helps ensure that both employers and migrants understand
eligibility requirements and selection criteria for entry. Systems allowing employers and migrant workers to track
their application status can increase confidence and allow for adjustments when bottlenecks are discovered. New
Zealand has used an “Expression of Interest” system to select qualified migrants from a pool of migrants who have
registered their interest and meet a set of baseline requirements. The system has helped eliminate backlogs of
applicants through the initial screening and periodic expirations of registrations (Bedford and Spoonley 2014).
Clearly differentiated admissions entry paths can target different types of workers. Singapore, for instance, has
three well-defined entry streams for lower-, middle-, and higher-skilled workers that rely on salary and education
requirements to distinguish workers of different skill levels. These entry streams then work with employment terms,
as the more stringent entry requirements also afford more beneficial employment terms.

Shortage lists can be used to improve the responsiveness of the admissions system to economic needs.
Shortage lists are used to determine which potential immigrants should be allowed entry. These lists are data- and
stakeholder-driven and seek to identify labor market shortages through quantitative and qualitative evidence
including labor force surveys, administrative data about immigration admissions, employer surveys, and stakeholder
consultations. Using data to identify labor market shortages creates a feedback loop between the immigration
system and the labor market to target migrant workers to the occupations in which they are most needed. The lists
also reassure the public that policy makers are closely monitoring the labor market and immigration. Shortage lists
can expedite the entry process by circumventing the need for employers to advertise jobs in a labor market test.

This means that applications to hire foreign workers can be processed more quickly, and both migrants and their
employers have more certainty about how the needs of the migration system are determined. Malaysia has recently
begun using a Critical Occupations List to identify sought-after, hard-to-fill, and strategic occupations that will be
used to inform immigration and human resource development policies.

Better regulation of the recruitment industry is important to reduce labor mobility costs and improve
protections for migrants. Additional licensing requirements can help ensure that recruitment agencies provide
quality services to migrant workers, though this depends on available capacity and resources. Good practices
include the requirement for recruitment agencies in the Philippines to attend a Pre-licensing Orientation Seminar
prior to receiving a license, and a Continuing Agency Education Seminar for license renewal. Australia’s Office of
Migration Agents Registration Authority regulates and oversees migration agents, but also provides services to
migrants such as helping them identify an agent, advising them on fees, and processing complaints (World Bank
2017). Finally, sending countries may consider requiring licensed agencies to agree to joint and several liability
for claims made by migrants against employers, as occurs in the Philippines.

Increased information can help reduce the information asymmetries faced by migrant workers while also
improving oversight of recruitment agencies. Strategies to improve migrants’ access to information include
public employment services to provide potential migrants with job opportunities abroad, and training courses
that provide detailed information about migration procedures and employment abroad. The Republic of Korea’s
Employment Permit System (EPS) has a user-friendly website with information available to foreign workers in
their native language. The Philippines provides a listing of job opportunities available abroad through the job
advertising site JobStreet.com.9 The Philippines’ Pre-Employment Orientation Seminar (PEOS) includes modules on
working overseas, job search, illegal recruitment, allowable fees and the minimum provisions of the employment
contract, and country-specific information. The PEOS is mandatory for potential migrants, but the course can be
completed online at no cost. The Moroccan National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (ANAPEC)
promotes the employment of skilled individuals and registers foreign employers and Moroccan youth for job
matching. Users of recruitment agencies can also be allowed to evaluate the agencies, with the evaluations made
public. Singapore has announced a system to allow employers of foreign domestic workers to rate employment
agencies on their performance in explaining the application process, providing advice, and selecting a worker.
A more comprehensive system would also permit the worker to rate the agency. Recruitment agencies can be
awarded publicly for their effectiveness, as the Philippines does, or even receive expedited processing of licenses
or waiver of license renewal obligations. An evaluation of the impact of providing information about the quality of
recruitment agencies to potential migrants is currently in process in the Philippines (Bazzi et al. 2015).


ÌÌEmployment

Employment terms can be used alongside entry paths to differentiate migrants by skill and productivity.
Migrant-receiving countries can offer more generous employment terms to more highly skilled migrants including
lengthier employment passes and the ability to bring dependents. But in general, allowing migrants, whether low-
or high-skilled, to change employers can ensure that rigid terms do not limit productivity by preventing better
matches between employers and workers. Rigid employment terms also make migrants vulnerable to mistreatment

by employers, who can revoke their employment pass. Both Singapore and Malaysia have a type of employment
pass that is not employer-specific, though in both countries the pass is available to only very highly skilled
migrants. Finally, the renewal of employment passes should be a fast and easy process. Renewal requirements
should be minimal and subject to rigorous cost-benefit analysis. To expedite renewal of employment passes, a
trusted employer scheme could be created to limit renewal steps for previously compliant firms or for those whose
profile makes them unlikely to violate employment or recruitment procedures.

Sending countries have a significant role to play both in protecting migrants while they are employed
abroad and in assisting them in the migration process. Sending countries may consider providing predeparture
loans to migrant workers, particularly poorer and low-skilled ones, who may not be able to migrate because of
high migration costs. Source-country actions to facilitate migration, including reducing information, job search,
and documentation costs, do not seem to increase international migration (Beam, McKenzie, and Yang 2015).
However, there is some evidence that easing financial constraints may generate additional migration (Angelucci
2015; Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak 2014).

Orientation programs can also improve migrant workers’ experience abroad. Evidence on the impact of these
trainings is limited (McKenzie and Yang 2015). The Philippines is generally lauded for its commitment to increasing
the knowledge of migrant workers. Some good practices identified with the Philippines’ orientation programs
are the involvement of local government partners, the inclusion of NGOs to incorporate a rights perspective,
developing orientation programs for recruiters, and providing migration information at the local level (Asis and
Agunias 2012). Use of a standardized curriculum and oversight of implementation to ensure that all migrants
undertake orientation seem to be important elements of success.

Offering orientation programs to migrant workers after their arrival at the destination may help reinforce
knowledge gained during predeparture training; financial literacy training may also be useful. The
Philippines’ Post-Arrival Orientation Seminar (PAOS) provides information about rights, responsibilities, and
assistance in some destination countries. Financial literacy programs can improve financial knowledge, though the
design of these programs and their targeted beneficiaries are particularly important. A pilot program providing
financial literacy training to migrant domestic workers in the Greater Malang area and the Blitar District of East
Java in Indonesia had a positive impact on financial awareness and knowledge, budgeting, and savings, but no
increase in the quantity or frequency of remittances (Doi, McKenzie, and Zia 2014). Notably, effects were most
pronounced when both the migrant and their family members received training. Awareness of mandatory migrant
insurance increased significantly.


ÌÌExit

Sanctions and incentives can work together to encourage the voluntary departure of migrants. In addition to
incentives for employers to encourage on-time return as Singapore and Malaysia do, wages might also be withheld
from migrants or deposited in a compulsory savings scheme until they return to their source country. In Korea,
employers are required to enroll in Departure Guarantee Insurance and workers to enroll in Return Cost Insurance.
Similarly, Canada’s Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program requires workers to contribute to a compulsory savings
scheme that is available only upon a worker’s return to the source country. However, withholding funds increases

                                                                            EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC ECONOMIC UPDATE APRIL 2017




the risk for migrant workers who are vulnerable to unscrupulous employers who allow their work status to expire
(OECD 2013). Positive incentives for return also exist. This type of incentive includes tax rebates, guarantees of
future employment, or assistance with transportation, medical examinations, and document preparation (OECD
2013). EPS workers in Korea can receive free vocational training and job counseling during employment, job
matching services with Korean employers in home countries, and access to returnee networks that Korea has
created to expand job opportunities.

Sending-country policies to engage with and incentivize the return of their diasporas can generate
numerous benefits for home countries. Diaspora engagement policies help construct diaspora networks, which
circulate ideas, technology, and even capital (Dickerson and Özden forthcoming). Programs such as Argentina’s
Research and Scientists Abroad (RAICES), Thailand’s Reverse Brain Drain project, and Ethiopia’s Diaspora Volunteer
Program seek to create links with talented members of the diaspora to assist in the host country.

Sending countries at times support the reintegration of return migrants, though there is little evidence
these programs are effective. Source countries can offer reintegration benefits to returning migrants. These can
include active labor market policies to help migrants find jobs or start businesses upon return. In general, there is
little evidence of the effectiveness of reintegration programs. In the Philippines, which has a suite of reintegration
programs, challenges for returning migrants include insufficient resources, lack of expertise, and an inhospitable
economic or investment climate (Battistella 2004). However, McKenzie and Yang (2015) describe several concerns
about the effectiveness of reintegration programs, including questioning why the programs should be targeted at
return migrants, in particular.


ÌÌEnforcement

Effective enforcement of immigration laws requires coordination among agencies, efforts beyond border
enforcement alone, and leveraging data. Ensuring that immigrants do not enter and work without proper
documentation requires more than border control which, while effective in some cases, is also costly, particularly
along long borders like Thailand’s borders with Lao PDR and Myanmar. Interior enforcement measures that target
employers to ensure they are using documented labor and treating immigrant workers appropriately can be effective.
Agencies charged with managing labor migration, which often hold data on employers of migrant workers and on
those workers, and agencies charged with border enforcement, which hold data on the exit and entry of migrants,
can leverage that knowledge to undertake joint enforcement efforts. Systems that are synchronized across agencies
can assist with assessing risk and tracking noncompliance through the development of risk-based monitoring to
guide enforcement. In low-capacity environments, coordination is even more important to ensure that limited staff
and resources are leveraged to the best extent possible.


ÌÌCountry-specific priorities

 estination countries should work toward migration systems that are responsive to economic needs, and consistent

with domestic policies and human capital levels.

    •• With low levels of undocumented migration and a sophisticated system of productivity-linked entry
       paths, Singapore will need to continue to work to build public trust in the migration system and improve
       protections for migrant workers.

    •• With high levels of undocumented migration but a less sophisticated admissions system than Singapore,
       Malaysia will need to work to make its immigration system more responsive to economic needs and work
       to collaborate more closely with both employers and sending countries.

    •• With high levels of undocumented migration, Thailand will need to work to formalize its large population
       of undocumented migrants, rationalize entry procedures that are costly and time-consuming, and rethink
       immigration policies such as levies and a repatriation fund, which exist only in law but not in practice,
       undermining the credibility of the migration system.

    •• As Brunei Darussalam seeks to encourage private sector employment among locals, it will need to ensure
       that a relatively complex system of quotas and levies based on geography, sector, and employer supports
       this goal while also meeting economic needs.

 ending countries should work to balance protection for migrant workers with the needs of economic development
S
while also supporting the reintegration of returned workers and connections to diasporas.

    •• The Philippines has a highly developed support system for migrant workers. However, the country must
       continue to evaluate and improve its services for migrants.

    •• Indonesia will need to improve coordination among agencies responsible for managing labor migration.
       Exit procedures for migrant workers will also need to be streamlined to encourage documented migration.

    •• Vietnam will need to evaluate its current policies for incentivizing out-migration to determine whether
       they are meeting the country’s needs. While the intention of these policies is laudable, other reforms are
       also necessary including review of recruitment agencies’ frequent and at least tacitly sanctioned practice
       of requiring migrant workers to pay a security deposit to guarantee their return, which is frequently not
       repaid. A national migration strategy could help guide reforms.

    •• Lower-capacity Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar should continue considering how migration can fit
       into their economic development strategies, shaping programs to make out-migration less costly and to
       create connections with diasporas to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and capital. These countries can
       look to the experience of the Philippines to develop institutions serving migrants and services such as
       predeparture orientation programs.

II.B.	 Tackling Farm Pollution in Developing East Asia1
                  In developing East Asia, more intensive agricultural practices have been successful in increasing food
                  availability and the output of agricultural raw materials, but have also resulted in serious pollution
                  problems that have adversely affected the environment, human health, and the productivity of agriculture
                  itself. This pattern of highly productive yet highly polluting agriculture is playing out with consequences
                  that remain poorly understood by most policy makers and the public. Agriculture is often portrayed as a
                  victim of industrial and urban pollution, and this is indeed the case. However, certain farming practices
                  have also become a leading source of soil, air, and water pollution in the most intensively farmed
                  parts of these countries. While a range of policy instruments is available to guide farming practices in
                  directions that will lessen their environmental footprint, most public intervention in this area has tended
                  to be more reactive than preventive and, in many cases, inadequate in scale. In many instances, the
                  implementation of sound pollution control programs has also come up against the impact of broader
                  incentive structures that do not rank environmental outcomes prominently. Governments therefore need
                  to make agricultural pollution a higher policy priority in order to reduce the costs of intensive farming.
                  In addition, more multipronged and evidence-based strategies will be needed to exploit the technical,
                  market, and structural opportunities to control and, more importantly, prevent pollution from intensive
                  farming.




The benefits of agricultural intensification

Agricultural intensification, that is, technological upgrading and the increased use of inputs, has boosted
agricultural productivity in developing East Asia and provided a solid footing for its growth. Across much
of the region, agricultural output has expanded rapidly, even as the share of agriculture in GDP has fallen with
these economies’ structural transformation. For instance, during 1990–2011, agricultural value added in China

and Vietnam grew by, respectively, 4.3 percent and 3.9 percent per year on average. Regional agriculture has
contributed to plummeting rates of hunger, even though serious nutritional challenges remain. Since 1990, the
prevalence of food inadequacy has more than halved in China and decreased by nearly 70 percent in Vietnam.
Similar trends can be observed across the region (Figure II.B.1). This achievement has rested centrally on the region’s
ability to multiply its production of grains (Figure II.B.2) despite being land-constrained. In the space of 60 years,
for example, China’s grain output increased fivefold—a doubling on a per capita basis—even though land devoted
to farming remained remarkably stable (Figure II.B.3). Greater use of inputs, irrigation, and mechanization have
played major parts in cereals output growth by helping to improve yields, and often by allowing producers to grow
more crops per year on a given plot of farmland.

 Note: Increases in harvested area sometimes reflect the more intensive use of farmland to grow more crops per year rather than a spatial expansion of farming. This has been especially the case in Vietnam.

Significance of agriculture as a polluter

 espite the above contributions, the breadth and severity of pollution problems to which agricultural development
D
has given rise may challenge the sector’s ability to remain a positive force in economic growth, livelihood provision,
and social stability. Evidence suggests that intensive farming operations have become a major source of water, soil,
ambient air, and climate pollution in China, Vietnam, and the Philippines.

      •• Water. Farming operations have significantly contributed to the contamination of both surface water and
         groundwater in parts of the region, with pollutants ranging from nutrients to organic matter, pesticides,
         and other toxic chemicals. In the Philippines, for example, livestock and other farms have been the largest
         contributors of organic matter pollution in the monitored waterbodies of Manila Bay and Laguna Lake
         (EMB 2014). China’s first national pollution survey found that, in 2007, agriculture was the leading source
         of surface water quality impairment with respect to nutrients and organic pollutants. Consistent with this,
         agriculture has been the leading cause of eutrophication in China’s lakes and in the Yellow and South
         China Seas (Strokal et al. 2014). In northern China, farming activities have also led to serious nitrate
         contamination of groundwater (Zhang et al. 2013a).

      •• Soil. One major form of soil pollution is acidification, a natural process that can be accelerated by
         such farming practices as irrigation, fertilization, and the removal of crop residues from farmland. Soil
         acidification can, in turn, favor the loss of soil nutrients as well as crops’ absorption of heavy metals. In
         China, the rate at which soils acidified between the 1980s and 2000s is one that would take hundreds of
         years to materialize under natural conditions (Zhang et al. 2013b).

      •• Air. Ambient air quality impairment is a major concern in many of East Asia’s densely populated
         metropolitan areas, and agriculture is known to be implicated. Fine particle and other emissions from
         agricultural burning, improper manure storage, and fertilizer and pesticide use contribute to air pollution
         and related disease. Ammonia releases from agricultural sources were recently shown to be detracting from
         urban air quality in Chinese cities (Gu et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2013). Open burning of agricultural residues
         has also been tied to an abundance of fine particulate matter in certain cities on a seasonal basis (Zhang
         and Cao 2015). In Indonesia, fire has been a prominent means of clearing land to grow oil palm, from
         which lucrative commodities are derived. The resulting haze has badly affected air quality in both rural and
         urban areas.

      •• Climate. Farming activities—especially livestock rearing, excess fertilizer use, and rice irrigation—are also
         significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the region. They are the second-largest source of
         GHG emissions in Vietnam and the Philippines, without counting emissions related to agriculture-driven
         land-use change (Figure II.B.5 and Figure II.B.6) (based on WRI CAIT 2016). In absolute terms, China’s
         agricultural emissions are far larger, even though they were outranked by industrial emissions after 2005,
         putting them in third place nationally. The implication is that changes in farming practices will be needed
         for countries to meet their international commitments to climate change mitigation.2




2	   By one estimate, Indonesian fires—which are predominantly agriculture-driven—emitted an estimated 1,750 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2-e) in 2015, close
     to the 1,800 MtCO2-e that Indonesia reported in its Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (World Bank 2016a;

Adverse impacts of farm pollution

Changing farming patterns and practices represent a growing concern for human and wildlife health, and
agricultural productivity. Though evidence linking intensive farming practices to these is incomplete, impacts
can be inferred from the levels of pollution being observed based on well-understood impact pathways.

From a health perspective, drinking water contamination is a key concern in the region, as are the
development of drug-resistant microbes, food contamination, and poor air quality. In China, agriculture
bears substantial responsibility for the fact that in 2014, over 61 percent of monitored groundwater sources and
nearly 29 percent of monitored rivers were found to be unfit for human contact, and that 39 percent of major
lakes and reservoirs failed to meet drinking or bathing water standards (China Ministry of Environmental Protection
2015). In Vietnam, livestock farms are reported to be seriously detracting from the safety of drinking water supplies
to Ho Chi Minh City,3 and this is also likely to be the case for Hanoi and Manila, given the intensity of livestock
production in their peri-urban areas. Groundwater pollution has been less well studied, but pesticides used in rice
fields have been shown to compromise the safety of groundwater extracted from wells in Vietnam (Chau et al.
2015). Farm workers and rural populations are the most exposed to pesticide poisoning (Dasgupta et al. 2007;
Nguyen 2016). Meanwhile, a large body of evidence has tied pesticide exposure to elevated rates of chronic disease
such as different types of cancers, birth defects, and several types of neurodegenerative and reproductive disorders
(Mostafalou and Abdollahi 2013). Exposure to chemicals in plastics, an issue of particular relevance in China, may
also have some of these chronic health effects.4 Nitrates in drinking water from animal feces and fertilizer also
increase the risk of various health problems (Naidenko, Coc, and Bruzelius 2012; Morales-Suarez, Llopis-Gonzalez,
and Tejerizo-Perez 1995; Gulis, Czompolyova, and Cerhan 2002).

For wildlife and ecosystems on the front lines of exposure, the health effects of agricultural pollutants can
be even more severe than for people. Mass fish kills are a common occurrence in aquaculture operations in the
Philippines, with over 300 incidents recorded just between 2005 and 2014 (Cuvin-Aralar, Ricafort, and Salvacion
forthcoming). In China, 30 to 40 percent of monitored surface waters are polluted to an extent that has been
associated with biodiversity losses elsewhere. Pollinator disappearance, such as that which has reportedly occurred
in fruit-tree-growing parts of Western China, along with recorded instances of fish kills, illustrate how agricultural
pollution is threatening the survival of critical populations or species on which humans depend.

Agricultural productivity is also adversely impacted. Soil fertility and crop yields are at risk when fertilizer losses,
field burning, and the use of plastic ground covers, irrigation, and other farming activities result in soil acidification,
salinization, warming, and other disturbances. In southern China, where a full 65 percent of agricultural soils have
become severely acidified, fertilizer use has been both a cause and response to soil acidification, fueling a vicious
cycle of degradation (Zhang et al. 2013b). Soil acidification has also likely accelerated the uptake of industrial
heavy metal pollution by food crops, creating a human health hazard and leading to the rejection of these crops by
markets. The loss of pollination and biological control services has already saddled farmers with heavy labor and
pesticide costs, notably in China’s fruit-growing regions. And drug resistance in confined livestock and aquaculture
operations may open new pathways for pandemics that would adversely affect these industries.

The available, although still limited, evidence suggests that the economic costs of farm pollution are high.
One research team, for instance, estimated that China’s excessive emissions of nitrogen, related to the production
of staple food, cost the country 1.4 percent of annual GDP (close to US$49 billion) during 2001–10 (Xia and
Yan 2016). In Indonesia, forest fires tied in large part to the conversion of land for oil palm production cost an
estimated US$16.1 billion in 2015, more than the value added by palm oil production in 2014 (US$12 billion)
(World Bank 2016a).




Sources of pollution from farming practices

T
 hese practices relate to the management of both inputs and outputs in crop and animal agriculture, including the
examples below.

Poor livestock waste management. The dumping of untreated manure and feces-laden waste and wastewater
from livestock and aquaculture operations into the environment is a rampant, often uncontrolled, and expanding
problem, as is its improper storage. For example, an estimated 36 percent of animal waste generated in Vietnam is
directly dumped into the environment without treatment (Dinh forthcoming), and up to 80 percent of animal waste
is disposed of in this manner in some parts of the Philippines (Catelo, Narrod, and Tiongco 2008).

Improper use of feed, drugs, other growth enhancers, and other chemicals in aquaculture and livestock
breeding. Reliance on feeds and supplements is a key feature of industrial animal agriculture on both large and
small scales, and gives rise to pollution in several ways. Aquaculture operations lose most of the feed (or fertilizer)
they add to their waters, and nutrient pollution has become particularly problematic in the open systems that
have come to dominate the subsector, as these entail the release rather than the recycling of excess nutrients.

Furthermore, the prophylactic and growth-enhancing use of drugs, hormones, and heavy metals is now a standard
practice in the livestock and aquaculture industries in the three studied countries, despite being dominated by
smallholders. Over 45 antibiotics are widely used in Vietnamese livestock and aquaculture production (Dương and
Nguyen 2015; Kim et al. 2013; Thinh et al. 2015; Tu et al. 2006). In the Philippines, reproductive hormones have
been used for years in many different forms of aquaculture (Cuvin-Aralar, Ricafort, and Salvacion forthcoming).
Aquaculture operations are also treated with large numbers of potentially harmful chemicals including persistent,
toxic compounds (Nguyen et al. 2015; Tu et al. 2006).

Note: Large discrepancies have been noted in Chinese fertilizer use reported by different sources. In        Vietnam’s Central Highlands (Amarasinghe et al. 2015;
2013, the Food and Agricultural Organization estimated the consumption of synthetic fertilizer at close
to 40 million tons, whereas China’s National Bureau of Statistics estimated its use at close to 60 million   Technoserve 2013). Pesticide use has soared in China

Improper disposal of plastics. Another emerging concern is the use and improper disposal of agricultural plastics,
many after only a single growing season. This is a particular concern in China, where the use of plastic film “mulch”
has transformed and enabled the expansion of vegetable and cotton production in the country’s cold and arid
regions. In China, plastic film use grew more than 150-fold between 1982 and 2014 in area terms, and 200-fold in
tonnage terms (Figure II.B.8) (Yan 2015; China Rural Statistical Yearbook 2015). The use and disposal of plastics
is associated with many concerns relating namely to soil fertility, food safety and health, and the protection of
wildlife.

Open burning. In many parts of the region, maize, rice, and wheat residues are systematically burned for the sake
of expedience and labor savings. Time and labor scarcity, the lack of market channels for straws and husks, and
certain agronomic beliefs are among the factors thought to contribute to this practice.

Structural and policy drivers of farm pollution

Demographic growth and a societal focus on output and yield growth, shaped in part by policy, have
favored development approaches that regard the environment as a resource for exploitation. Direct and
indirect fertilizer subsidies (as those in Indonesia, Vietnam, and China—China’s are undergoing reform—and,
formerly, in the Philippines), preferential input loans, extension messages, and product advertising have helped
cement a widespread belief among farmers that applying more fertilizer always results in higher yields. This has
contributed to the overuse of fertilizer. Specialization in crop agriculture, the simplification of agroecosystems,
and the move to monoculture—favored by investment in irrigation infrastructure and extension messages, and
sometimes inflexible land-use policies—have accelerated farms’ loss of natural predators and fertility, increased
their susceptibility to pests and disease, and driven a greater reliance on synthetic chemicals to address these. The

expansion of irrigated agriculture, a centerpiece of public investment in agriculture in several countries, has also
unwittingly contributed to agrochemical runoff, soil salinization, and rice-related greenhouse gas emissions.

The sector’s high degree of responsiveness to the emerging demands of urbanizing populations has
resulted in a more polluting mix of products and practices, and a greater proximity of populations to
agricultural sources of pollution. The rise of animal agriculture, including the surge in confined pig and fish
farms, in response to the growth in demand for animal products, has led to increased pollution. The clustering
of agricultural activities and their increasing juxtaposition with dense population centers has increased human
exposure to the sector’s ever concentrating set of pollutants. Chinese agriculture’s response to rising demand
for fruit and vegetables in a water-scarce environment has most recently driven plastic, nutrient, and pesticide
pollution concerns.

Pollution has, so far, been a major downside of the rapid intensification of production. In a region bent on
leap-frogging as a development strategy, the uptake of pesticides and other chemicals in farming has happened
so fast in East Asia that it has sometimes outpaced awareness of their dangers on the part of either farmers
or regulators, the latter’s capacity to regulate them, and the adoption of safe handling techniques. Importing
aquaculture species bred for intensive farming has been a quick way to develop a high-output seafood industry—
yet one that has increased the risk of genetic contamination, disease, and biodiversity loss. Some of East Asia’s
aquaculture activities have developed around potentially invasive species such as trout, Chinese carps, and tilapia,
which can represent a threat to the health and survival of native species.

Limited space for agriculture and the continued dominance of small farm size has challenged producers’ and
regulators’ capacity to moderate pollution. Limited space for farming has detracted from sound environmental
management in some cases. In animal farming, for example, cramped conditions have dissuaded producers from
devoting space to waste treatment facilities, especially in light of limited opportunities for market reward and the
weak enforcement of waste management regulations. The small size (and limited capacity and resources) of most
livestock and aquaculture operations, taken individually, has also possibly dissuaded regulators from imposing
more stringent waste management requirements or even just scrutiny over these, even though they generate vast
amounts of pollution aggregately. Meanwhile, farmers with limited land are increasingly having to seek off-farm
income opportunities to make ends meet, and this sometimes leaves them with insufficient time for judicious farm
management practices.

However, where consolidation is occurring and industrial farms are emerging, the pollution situation is
not always improving. The large, industrial operations that are in fact emerging in the livestock and aquaculture
sectors, especially in China and Vietnam, have a mixed record in terms of cleaning up the industry through the
use of more sophisticated waste management techniques. Similarly, croplands that have been given over to large
players are not always the most exemplary, perhaps because with market dominance and economic strength comes
political influence and regulatory capture.

Current approaches and why they are falling short of expectations

Recognizing the above challenges, governments in the region have started reacting to various degrees.
In China, and to a growing extent in Vietnam, the harmful side effects of agricultural intensification have come
to light and started to drive changes in policy. China has gone the furthest down this path as the heavy costs of
rampant pollution have turned the matter into a simmering public concern. Within the region, China has probably
established the most extensive cadre of agriculture-sector-specific laws, regulations, and incentive programs to
monitor, prevent, and control pollution. In Vietnam, many government efforts to limit and control agricultural
pollution are also underway as its effects are being felt ever more widely.

Still, government interventions remain largely reactive and experimental. In the Philippines, where
agricultural pollution is of lesser severity overall, or rather more localized, the government has put in place fewer
agriculture-specific laws and programs. In all three countries, meanwhile, laws to prevent and control pollution
are commonly ignored, and incentive programs are sometimes too weak. In Vietnam, for example, this applies to
both laws and incentive programs intended to improve the management of livestock waste. And various successful
incentive and demonstration programs have yet to surmount the challenges of sustainability and scale-up. This, for
example, will be the next step for Vietnam’s “One Must Five Reductions” approach,5 now that it has demonstrated
that rice, incomes, and the environment can benefit when farmers manage inputs and resources more judiciously.

Most recently, China and Vietnam have started to embrace a more balanced set of agricultural policies
that not only place greater emphasis on environmental sustainability but also link it to emerging and
long-standing priorities of agricultural policy such as food quality, competitiveness, yield performance,
and food security. In fact, judging from the Sustainable Agricultural Development Plan it adopted in 2015, China
may now be turning a corner in starting to address the issue more strategically, with greater attention to prevention
and to taking successful approaches to scale. To date, the above logic has not been the norm in the three countries,
however, and socializing this way of thinking to see it through is likely to be challenging. This points to the need
not only for efforts on the legal, technical, and economic fronts, but also for institutional reforms encompassing
the incentives, culture, and priorities of regulators. Adequate public sector funding, as well as market participation,
will also help mobilize and sustain adequate resources for such things as monitoring, enforcement, and various
forms of subsidy (for sustainable agriculture).




Toward an effective strategy: Curbing agricultural pollution will require the public
sector to set priorities, effectively compel and motivate farmers, back innovation
and learning, and influence the sector’s structure and growth trajectory from farm to
table

Though imperfect, evidence supports a number of priority areas in which more and better policy intervention
is needed. As noted, the data and knowledge gaps surrounding agricultural pollution and its effects on the region
are profound. Nonetheless, enough is understood to point to a number of farming patterns that are making critical



5	   Developed by the International Rice Research Institute in collaboration with the An Giang Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, this approach calls for farmers to use
     certified seeds (the “one must”), while reducing the use of four production inputs (seed, water, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers) and postharvest losses (the “five reductions”).

contributions to the region’s pollution woes, and to define a number of priorities. A rank ordering of priorities
would differ among countries but, overall, attention needs to be given, among other things, to:

    •• Promoting more “precise,” less wasteful use of fertilizers, thereby cutting farmers’ expenses and reducing
       the range of adverse environmental effects associated with fertilizer losses.

    •• Drastically cutting back on the prophylactic, veterinary use of antibiotics in animal agriculture, the
       commercial benefits of which may be far overshadowed by the costs of drug resistance.

    •• Reducing and better managing the organic byproducts of farming—animal wastes and crop residues—
       including by deriving value from these (for instance, as nutrient resources for crop production).

    •• Professionalizing the use of pesticides and promoting the use of low-toxicity, low-residue, and high-
       efficiency control agents.

    •• Promoting the reuse and recycling of plastics as well as alternative technologies, especially for use in cold,
       dry, and other conditions in which plastics have revolutionized farming.

In relation to each of these areas, a variety of technical solutions exist. In various parts of the region, for
example, nutrient management tools, including ones that bypass soil testing, have proven effective at reducing
fertilizer use along with waste and imbalances. Soil testing kits and laboratories, formula and slow-release fertilizer,
smaller or redesigned chemical containers, and micro-irrigation can also improve fertilizer dosing and reduce
waste. Although it has faced challenges scaling up—namely due to small farm size—integrated pest management
(IPM) has empowered some farmers to reduce the use of pesticides, especially the most toxic ones, by using the
most toxic ones as a last resort, and favoring reliance on prevention and biological controls. Simple protective gear,
if it is worn, can reduce farm worker exposure when chemical spraying is deemed necessary.

In many cases, farmers need public sector support to adopt technologies and practices that make mitigation
a possibility, at least in the near term. In some cases, public sector intervention may only be needed initially
to overcome the hurdles of switching. For example, the World Bank-supported Guangdong Agricultural Pollution
Control Project in China is promoting a new type of housing for pigs that enables their wastes to be composted
on premise, making the wastes more valuable and easier to repurpose as fertilizer on cropland. Together with
automatic feeding, cooling, and ventilation systems, these improvements in waste management are also helping
to create a healthier environment for pigs and reduce reliance on antibiotics, hormones, and heavy metals. The
same project is also promoting no-till farming practices to retain crop residues in the field, conserve water, and
limit fertilizer and pesticide runoff.

Governments have a wide range of policy instruments at their disposal to promote greener farming
practices(Box II.B.1). Many of these are already being used in the region, sometimes on an experimental scale.
Typically, governments will need to develop multipronged programs that use combinations of these instruments,
including “sticks” and “carrots”, to send clear signals to farmers and facilitate effective responses. This is especially
the case where smallholders dominate, and command-and-control regulations will mostly be too costly to enforce.
In parts of the sector that have become more consolidated (for instance, for large livestock facilities), command-

and-control regulation may be appropriate. Yet experience shows that additional measures are needed to motivate
industry to comply and improve program cost-effectiveness. A combination of interventions, sequenced smartly,
can be the key to achieving results.

A strategy that effectively addresses and prevents agricultural pollution will need to extend beyond
the agricultural sector itself, and this calls for greater integration of agricultural, environmental, and
health policy. At the highest strategic level, health and environmental outcomes can become a central focus of

agricultural agencies, and agricultural productivity goals can be defined without losing sight of these. This may
mean taking a long view on yield enhancement that gives more weight to resource conservation. Agriculture’s
contribution to food security may also come to be as much about its contributions to micronutrient content and
diversity as to caloric and protein availability. Concretely, this means that the measurement of agricultural sector
performance needs a rethink.6 Health and environmental agencies can also bring agriculture more fully into their
fold. A greater orientation toward agriculture and food production will help ministries of health and environment
to more effectively curb the rise of chronic disease, and to maintain a productive resource base supportive of food
security and industry.

At the operational level, public resources can be redeployed more coherently, in ways more consistent
with reining in agricultural pollution. Certain uses of public resources are fueling rather than mitigating
avoidable forms of agricultural pollution, and these can be redeployed if addressing pollution becomes a high
enough priority. Examples include subsidies and preferential regulatory dispositions supporting the expansion
of the livestock industry, and direct or indirect fertilizer subsidies. Other uses of resources that have a more
neutral or indirect effect on agricultural pollution (such as farmer income support, and investments in irrigation
infrastructure, tree replanting, and so forth) also represent a missed opportunity in that they could be leveraged
in ways that support greener farming systems.

Also at the operational level, developing programs that cut across levels of government, sectors, and
administrative boundaries is often necessary to achieve environmentally significant results across all
kinds of farms and landscapes. This is acknowledging the fact that environmental challenges do not necessarily
respect political boundaries, thus calling for multistakeholder, multilevel, “landscape approaches”.

Translating this vision or orientation into effective and sustainable action requires investments in
different kinds of knowledge and continuous learning. The needs range in tangibility, going from investments
in hardware all the way to the building of technical capacity, the funding of research, the development of decision
tools, and consensus building among policy, science, and finance communities around impact indicators. For
example, investments in information technology (and training) to lower the costs of monitoring and enforcement
can help improve program targeting and bring mandatory measures into the mix of policies. Investments to
generate more multidisciplinary evidence on the physical and socioeconomic impacts of farming structures and
practices—and on the effectiveness of different interventions—will help guide prioritization efforts as well as
course corrections during implementation.

To get ahead of pollution—to control and prevent it effectively—governments also need to anticipate and
help shape structural change in the sector, from farm to table. Even if government intervenes effectively to
bring about the adoption of existing mitigation technology, and effectively stimulates technical innovation, there
is a limit to what technical solutions can achieve within existing production systems. In other words, structural
solutions are also needed to avert certain path dependencies, effect change at scale, and achieve deeper shades of
green (Box II.B.2). In this respect, industry growth represents a one-time opportunity to develop the food system
more sustainably. The case for this is especially true in the aquaculture, livestock, and horticulture subsectors, since
they are growing particularly rapidly. It is also true with respect to consumer food products and diets, as these are
rapidly changing along with incomes, lifestyles, and food marketing channels.

In general, examining tradeoffs will be central to determining what structural changes are desirable or
needed in the region. Farm consolidation and industrialization, for example, have pluses and minuses when it
comes to the control of pollution. On the one hand, a sector with fewer, more formal players is easier to monitor
and regulate. It may also have a higher technical and financial capacity to innovate and reduce its footprint. On
the other hand, concentration can result in volumes of waste that have the potential to be hugely polluting, and it
may not be economically viable to manage these in nonpolluting ways. To take another example, the consumption
of animal products is highly valued in the region, as evidenced by the boom in their consumption, despite their
high resource intensity and the many health risks these products carry.


    Box II.B.2. What are some of the aspects of farm sector development that the public sector might
    influence?

      •• 
         The number of animals per operation and their spatial density.

      •• 
         The spatial distribution of agricultural activities over the territory; and at the local level, the clustering
         of operations, especially aquaculture and livestock farms.

      •• 
         Farm consolidation, or the ability of small farms to operate as though they were larger ones.

      •• 
         The extent of farm specialization, and the embrace of monoculture versus polyculture.

      •• 
         Land available for agriculture versus other, nonagricultural uses.

      •• 
         The mix of foods and agricultural raw materials that are produced.


Because they are seldom a focus of agricultural policy, it is important to highlight that changes in consumer
product and diet choices, as shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces, can play a determinant
role in directing how the sector and its pollution footprint develop. Consumers can be powerful in expressing
preferences with their shopping baskets, whether through their choice of food groups or production characteristics.
Even though agricultural pollution is tied to production systems, consumers can play a role in shaping these.
Despite this, public sector efforts to mitigate and control pollution have only timidly tried to influence consumption
patterns, or to enable greater consumer feedback in value chains.

Consumer sensitization can be effective if paired with measures to enhance the availability—and hence
the production and marketing—of more benign food products. The promotion of diets centered on plant-based
foods can have a particularly significant impact on the sector’s development trajectory and footprint. Support for
voluntary food standards along with traceability and certification systems are another way of expanding consumer
choice. Economic incentives for marketers to embrace certified products can also help support consumer choice.
Consumer awareness of agriculture’s environmental footprint is often stimulated by their concerns for food safety,
including the presence of chemicals, antibiotics, and various other contaminants in food.

Looking ahead: Tackling East Asia’s agricultural pollution challenge is not only
within reach, but also a business, economic, and leadership opportunity

Doing more to avoid pollution and the worst of its effects is within reach. Rapid change in the region bodes
well for its ability to redirect farming—and the broader food sector—to a path of more durable and self-serving
growth. East Asia’s agricultural performance over the past 50 to 60 years also reflects its inclination for innovation,
its willingness to embrace new technology, and its capacity for transformation. Moreover, the strength, plurality,
and dynamism of regional food cultures can help provide the impetus that will be needed to green food production
and propel these food cultures into the 21st century.

Furthermore, like every crisis, agricultural pollution can be treated as an opportunity. While farming may be
at risk in parts of the region, far more is at stake than farming. And policy actions that will enable the public sector
to act on agricultural pollution more decisively—consistent with the strategies outlined above—may have benefits
that are felt more broadly. In particular, the public sector can position agriculture to thrive as a business and evolve
competitively by being at the service of human and ecosystem health, and domestic market opportunities. Building
domestically oriented capacity to control and prevent agricultural pollution specifically has the potential to help
national food industries remain competitive domestically.

Risks and Challenges

Financial stability risks associated with the rapid buildup
in domestic debt, including by local governments, are a
key near-term challenge. Credit to the government and
private nonfinancial sector increased by 16.2 percent
in 2016, up from an increase of 15.1 percent in 2015.
Although credit expansion contributed to strong growth
in 2016, corporate deleveraging could have an adverse
impact on growth in the short term. Improved resource
allocation and reduced financial vulnerabilities are
critical for sustaining China’s growth over the long

to narrow as domestic demand and imports recover.
The fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 3.7 percent
of GDP in FY2017, with public investment as the key
contributor. Similar trends are expected to continue
in outer years; however, underlying productivity
challenges will cap growth at 3.4 percent even in 2019.

Rising agricultural income in recent years mainly
reflected a global commodity price cycle, rather than
productivity increases in agriculture. As agricultural
prices retreat, growth could become less inclusive,
with the rural poor negatively affected. Constrained by
education attainment and skills levels, a large share
of the poor workers might not be able to reap the full
benefit of the job opportunities in the high-end services
sector. As a consequence, further improvement in living
conditions in rural areas may be more muted.

Continued government investment in basic infrastructure
such as national highways, local roads, community
irrigation, and water and sanitation is expected to
support relatively robust poverty-reduction, both via
improved standards of living and opportunities for
income generation. However, high-cost developments
such as the Tasi Mane project are expected to have only
a very weak impact on poverty reduction in the near
term, and may never yield a social return in a range of
feasible scenarios.


Risks and Challenges

Recent surveys show that since the period of civil
conflict in 2006, Timor-Leste has made good progress
in alleviating poverty, and the benefits of public
investments are becoming evident with sharply improved
access to electricity and significant improvements in
other basic infrastructure services. However, while it
may be appropriate for an initial stage of development,
these investments and the associated gains have
been achieved using a finite resource of oil revenues.
The overriding fiscal challenge for Timor-Leste is to
transition to a more sustainable model and rebalancing
towards private-sector-led growth over the next 5 to
10 years.

The prospect of new oil fields being exploited in Timor-
Leste remains highly uncertain. A recent joint statement
by the governments of Australia and Timor-Leste
indicated that they are engaging in discussions on a
permanent maritime boundary, which would determine
the national claims to the vast majority of viable oil
fields that lie in Australian waters. Even if viable
fields were developed, which is unlikely to happen for
10 years, efforts to diversify towards sustainable models
of private sector growth would be just as important to
provide a range of economic livelihood opportunities
and guard against possible effects of Dutch disease.

particularly since Vietnam’s credit-to-GDP ratio—about
120 percent in December 2016—is already high and
the overhang of past non-performing loans has not
been fully resolved.

Sizable and persistent fiscal deficits have emerged in
recent years. The fiscal deficit averaged 5.5 percent
of GDP during 2011–16, compared to 2.2 percent of
GDP during 2006–10. Preliminary data show that fiscal
pressure remained in 2016, where the fiscal deficit was
estimated at 6.5 percent of GDP. Persistently high fiscal
deficit is the main reason for accumulating public debt
which was estimated to reach the legally mandated
ceiling of 65 percent of GDP at the end of 2016.


Outlook

Vietnam’s medium-term outlook remains favorable.
GDP growth is projected to improve gradually during
2017-2019, driven by robust domestic demand and
export-oriented manufacturing. Inflation pressures
