What is the Lagging Regions Initiative
The scope of the EU Cohesion Policy is to narrow development gaps and reduce disparities between Member
Countries and regions. To this extent, around €454 billion of ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds
have been allocated to help EU regions become more competitive. However, not all EU regions have been able
to fully take advantage of the benefits of EU growth, due to the effects of the 2008 economic crisis and due to
a host of structural problems.

To this end, Corina Crețu, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, together with the Task Force for Better
Implementation has started the Lagging Regions Initiative. The aim of the Initiative is to identify what holds
back growth in less developed regions, and to provide targeted actions for unlocking their growth potential.
Thus, these lagging regions will be assisted to involve a broad range of stakeholders (regional and local
administrations, educational institutions, business support institutions, SMEs, entrepreneurs, investors, NGOs,
IFIs) to help respond to concrete needs they have and to maximize the impact of regional investments. Two
types of lagging regions have been identified:

•	   LOW GROWTH REGIONS, which cover the less developed and transition regions that did not converge to
     the EU average between the years 2000 and 2013 in Member States with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below
     the EU average in 2013. These include almost all the less developed and transition regions in Greece, Italy,
     Spain and Portugal

•	   LOW INCOME REGIONS, covering all the regions with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below 50% of the EU average
     in 2013. This group covers the less developed regions of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

Poland and Romania are the first countries to pilot this initiative, with two regions each – Swietokrzyskie and
Podkarpackie in Poland, and North-West and North-East in Romania. In April 2016, Commissioner Crețu together
with Marshal Adam Jarubas in Swietokrzyskie and Marshal Wladyslaw Ortyl in Podkarpackie have officially
launched the Polish part of the Lagging Regions Initiative called „Catching-up Regions Poland”. The „Catching-
up Regions Poland” is an implementation-focused program that aims at providing tailored support to the two
Polish regions to boost the impact of EU and private investments in specific areas selected by the two regions.

Over a year of joint work, the World Bank provided hands-on technical assistance and helped coordinate five
activities that were selected by the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions in coordination with the European
Commission, Ministry of Economic Development, and the Bank. The five selected activities were:

•	   Improving the commercialization of Research & Development (R&D) results generated by public research
     facilities and enabling better utilization of existing technology transfer centers in the Podkarpackie region.

•	   Strengthening the vocational education and training system in the Swietokrzyskie region, using best practice
     examples from around the world and tailoring them to the regional context.

•	   Activating entrepreneurship in deprived areas in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions.

•	   Identifying ways to improve conditions for starting a business in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie
     regions.

•	   Supporting the creation of in-house financial instruments in the Podkarpackie region.

                                                9
                   This is the final report of Activity 2 of the Poland’s Catching Up Regions Trust Fund.
                   The European Commission specified the Terms of Reference (TOR) for Activity 2, as follows:
                   	Developing and implementing a system to stimulate uptake of services in SMEs, and
                    identifying ways for SMEs to more easily access relevant EU funds. This activity will have
                    as a distinct output a report prepared by the Bank with proposals for how SMEs could
                    better take advantage of services offered by public institutions in the selected poviats and
                    recommendations regarding adjusting services provided to SMEs by the BSIs in the region.

                   Accordingly, this final report is a proposed design for an enterprise support system.
                   Preparatory research was presented in prior reports and is included in Annexes 1, 2, and
                   3. For ease of reference, this scheme will be referred to by its working title: the Enterprise
                   Competitiveness Scheme (ECS).

                   In brief, the ECS is comprised of three windows for enterprise support services:
                   Operational; Strategic; and Group. In all three windows, beneficiary Small and Medium-
                   Size enterprises (SMEs) will receive public financial support for co-financing of business
                   advisory services to improve competitiveness and contribute to regional economic growth.

                   1.	 Operational window. This window distributes small vouchers of 5 000 to 12 500 PLN (2
                       800 EUR) to SMEs fulfilling basic eligibility criteria. These vouchers are designed to support
                       standardized services, which assist the firm in improving or expanding existing operations.
                       Example expenditures are: marketing consulting services; website development;
                       assistance in applications for financing; and specialized skills training. Expenditures must
                       be matched by the SME at a minimum 50% ratio, so the maximum value for the services
                       will be 25 000 PLN.

                   2.	 Strategic window. This window distributes larger vouchers of 15 000 to 120 000 PLN (27
                       000 EUR) to SMEs through a competitive process. These vouchers are designed to support
                       larger, more complex consulting services, which assist the firm in changing its orientation.
                       Example expenditures include: marketing strategies; assistance to enter foreign markets;
                       improving production processes; and strategic planning for new products and markets
                       (either foreign or domestic). Expenditures must be matched by the SME at a minimum
                       40% ratio (i.e. 60% contribution from public resources), so the maximum value for the
                       services will be 200 000 PLN.

                   3.	 Group window. This window distributes a few large matching vouchers between 120 000
                       and 2 000 000 PLN to consortia of SMEs, following a competitive application and review.
                       These vouchers are designed to support joint initiatives between the SMEs that reduce
                       constraints on the competitiveness of multiple SMEs. Examples of potential joint programs
                       include: development of procurement activities (to reduce costs); lobbying (e.g. to obtain
                       mutually beneficial support for purposes to be determined by the SMEs); and products’
                       development (e.g. regional branding or marketing for cultural tourism). Expenditures must
                       be matched by a consortium at a 15% ratio (i.e. an 85% contribution from public resources
                       as a voucher), with a maximum total for the services of 2 352 940 PLN.

                 2.1 Objectives

                         This document proposes a design for an enterprise support scheme in Świętokrzyskie
                         and Podkarpackie regions of Poland. For ease of reference, this scheme will be referred to
                         by a working title: the Enterprise Competitiveness Scheme (ECS).

                         The objective of the ECS is to support further competitiveness of SMEs in targeted
                         regions to increase their contribution to regional economic growth, particularly
                         through jobs. The scheme will boost SMEs abilities to compete with firms outside their
                         region, through increased exports and/or outcompeting imports.

                         The ECS will establish an enterprise support system that is focused on demand
                         for services from SMEs, rather than on the supply of particular support initiatives
                         from BSIs. In recent years, publicly-funded business support measures focused on BSIs as
                         interlocutors to provide create and market advisory and other services to SMEs. Unfortunately,
                         this process created a supply-driven offer, not necessarily matching demand from SMEs. The
                         ECS is intended to be more responsive to firms’ needs, and BSIs’ services should be demand-
                         driven.

                         Funds available for the ECS are likely to be a maximum of 49,5 million Euro in
                         Świętokrzyskie, and approximately 8 million Euro in Podkarpackie (with the ability
                         to increase this allocation over time).2 These funds should be available without major
                         modifications to the regional Operational Programmes (OPs).




                2.2 Context

                         Preparatory research by the World Bank team revealed the following insights. These
                         are described in more detail in Annex 1, and are based upon in-depth interviews with 40
                         SMEs in the two regions during mid-2016.

                         •	   Almost all interviewed SMEs noted how tough competition in their industry is.
                              Many SMEs found it tough to compete successfully inside or outside their region. This
                              often stems from a lack of differentiation of their product, compared to their competitors
                              (thus making it difficult to earn a premium price). SMEs (especially smaller ones) are often
                              subcontractors to larger firms, and have little power to negotiate prices because their
                              products are widely available, and thus they cannot exercise market power.

                         •	   In most cases, SMEs compete on costs and price. Occasionally, companies manage to
                              demonstrate quality, but they remain in markets where only minimal quality standards are
                              required, thus they are stuck in a race to the bottom on price.

    These estimates are made on the basis of the World Bank team’s discussions with Marshals’ Offices in the two regions.

12    i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
•	     SMEs in both regions have potential to grow. Examples are demonstrated by a few
       SMEs, producing tradable goods and services, that have successfully differentiated their
       products, established a ‘niche’ or brand, and have quickly expanded, creating more jobs
       and increasing their revenues from exports. Examples include: a producer of handmade
       glass decorations that now has national and foreign buyers and is increasing its production
       capacity; a manufacturer of specialized mirrors that has increased its production capacity
       25 times in the last 10 years.3

We created classifications for three types of SMEs in the two regions, as shown in Figure 1. It
should be noted that we do not attempt to estimate the proportions of SMEs that fall into
each category.

               markets, producing products of a minimally acceptable quality for low price.

    Many examples of firms in each category are given on pages 13 and 14 of Annex 1.

                                                                                       2 - Rationale and Background   13
                          The aim of the ECS scheme could help: SMEs in Category 3 move into Category 2;
                          SMEs in Category 2 to move into Category 1; and SMEs in Category 1 sustain and
                          improve their ability to compete successfully. SMEs in Category 3 did not have plans for
                          investments or to improve their margins (and in some cases no willingness to do so). SMEs
                          in Category 2 had some ideas to improve their competiveness, but had not implemented
                          investment plans, nor pivoted their businesses towards opportunities for growth. SMEs in
                          Category 1 will need to further adapt and sustain their competitive niche in existing or new
                          markets; they are more likely accustomed to using specialized consultancy services already,
                          but face a difficulty in identifying quality consultants and service providers.

                          Based on the range of needs, a diversity of services will be required—often customized
                          at the individual SME level. Consulting services to support the growth of SMEs must be
                          specialized according to particular industries and particular firms (in order to reveal industry-
                          specific opportunities: for example, market opportunities in apple exports will be different to
                          mirror exports), and according to characteristics of the business (size, management structure,
                          willingness to take risks, etc). It is reasonable to assume that delivery of these services will
                          need to be tailored to the needs of each firm.

                          SMEs’ interest in business development services varied substantially. Several patterns
                          emerged during our interviews with 40 SMEs:4

                          •	    Highly ranked services are often strategic services. (rather than operational services),
                                which can help a business change its practices, develop new products, and reach new
                                markets.

                          •	    Mid-ranked services are those often given by enterprise support programs. (e.g.
                                business planning, specialized training, support in accessing finance), but it is notable that
                                these may not be top priorities overall.)

                          •	    Few firms ranked ‘managerial training’ as a priority, but this need was inferred
                                by interviewers after talking in-depth with managers about: strategic decision-
                                making; supervising daily operations (e.g. a general manager is trying to cover marketing,
                                accounting, and staff management, despite declared shortcomings in their knowledge);
                                and motivation levels amongst workers, which may reflect managerial shortcomings as
                                much as any intrinsic deficit in worker quality.

                          Overall, the interviews suggested there is a shortage of such services. SMEs declared
                          a need and a willingness to pay for a range of consultancy services, but often would pay, “as
                          long as it is of good quality. Sometimes it turns out we know more than the ‘expert.’” SMEs
                          also recognized the need, and the potential benefits, of group services, but were unwilling to
                          pay for them (fearing difficulties in implementation, and a risk of ‘free-riding’ by SMEs who
                          did not pay). These findings are shown in detail in Annex 2, including examples of the types
                          of services SMEs most desired.

                          These findings informed the design of the ECS. They indicate SMEs’ potential growth
                          and increased competitiveness along with a demand for business development service The
                          ECS will address SMEs’ concerns about paying for consulting services.

2.3 Process for designing the scheme

  The ECS was designed through the following process:

  (i) Assessment of demand and needs for business development services by SMEs,
  including in-depth, one-on-one interviews with 40 SMEs to understand the private sector
  context in the targeted lagging districts (the four poviats in which the World Bank team was
  requested to focus its work). The results of this assessment are reported in Annexes 1 and 2 of
  this document.

  (ii) Assessment of current supply of business development services, through interviews with
  approximately 20 BSIs. The results of this assessment are reported in Annex 3 of this document.

  (iii) Stakeholder group meetings (discussion seminars):
  •	   1st June 2016: in Staszów with the powiat authorities, the Governor and representatives of
       the local Chamber of Commerce;
  •	   2nd June 2016: in Staszów with the powiat authorities – including the Mayor, and Deputy
       Mayor, and the Director of the Labor Office;
  •	   3rd June 2016: in Sandomierz with the powiat authorities, including the Governor and
       Deputy Governor, Mayor and Deputy Mayor, and representatives of the local BSIs;
  •	   21st June 2016: in Leżajsk and in Brzozów with the powiat and town authorities—including
       the Governor and deputy Governor in Leżajsk, Mayor of Leżajsk, and Director of the
       Brzozów Labor Office;
  •	   22nd June 2016: in Rzeszów with the Leżajsk and Brzozów powiat and town authorities,
       plus BSIs and the Podkarpackie region’s Marshal’s Office.

  (iv) Review of prior schemes and ‘good practice’ documentation5 The team accounted
  for patterns observed in successful schemes elsewhere in the world.

  (v) Internal team design proposals. In order to lessen the risk of ‘groupthink,’ the team of
  five core members split into two groups and independently designed proposals. The team
  coordinator then selected the best features from each one.

  (vi) Technical discussions with the appropriate technical staff of the Marshals’ Offices
  of Świętokrzyskie and Podkarpackie:
  •	   3rd November 2016: in Kielce (both Marshals’ Offices participated);
  •	   6th December 2016: in Rzeszów (both Marshals’ Offices participated).

  (vii) Key decisions put to the Steering Committee in Warsaw on 10th November 2016. The
  Steering Committee was asked its preferences on several alternatives within each element of
  the scheme’s design.

  (viii) Economic and Financial Analysis. A summary of the EFA is included in this document.
  The EFA aims to forecast the approximate impact of the ECS scheme, including an analysis of
  the core assumptions and their effects on the scheme.

  (ix) Final report drafted and peer reviewed. Three peer reviewers with substantial and
  diverse experience were chosen: John Nasir (Lead Economist, World Bank), Xavier Cirera
  (Senior Economist, World Bank), and Stephen Roper (Professor, Warwick Business School, UK).

                   (x) Feedback and comments incorporated. Written comments were received from the
                   European Commission, the Polish Ministry of Economic Development, and the Marshal’s Office
                   of Świętokrzyskie. Verbal comments were received from the Marshal’s Office of Podkarpackie.
                   A Steering Committee on 3rd February 2017 decided on the remaining unresolved issues, and
                   the final report was revised accordingly.




            2.4 Logical framework

                   The ECS subsidizes the expansion of the business development services’ market. The
                   subsidy is expected to generate the following impacts:

                   (i)	 An increase in demand by SMEs for business development services;
                   (ii)	 As more service providers enter the market, prices will be reduced through competition,
                         while quality should increase;
                   (iii)	 The ECS will be successful if, when the subsidy is removed, the level of demand for
                          business development services remains higher than when the scheme commenced.

                   The logical framework for the scheme is represented in Table 1.

2.5 Monitoring, Evaluation & Improvements

  This section proposes arrangements for monitoring, evaluating, and improving the scheme
  over time.

  2.5.1 Monitoring
  The impacts of the ECS scheme should be tracked to ensure that its financial input
  is worthwhile, based on outcomes. The ECS Administrator should track the following
  metrics on a six-month basis:

  •	   Output indicators. The ECS Administrator must track the following indicators:
  •	   Number of enquiries; number of vouchers awarded; number of vouchers used;6
  •	   Number of enterprises receiving services (by SME size category, industry category, and
       location [which powiat]);
  •	   Type of services for which vouchers are utilized;
  •	   Systematic patterns in ratings and comments on ‘ECS marketplace’ website (e.g. repeated
       problems in delivery of particular types of services);
  •	   Frequent complaints via the ‘grievance redress mechanism’ of the ECS Administrator;
  •	   Positive comments and feedback from voucher recipients about their impact.

  •	   Outcome indicators. These indicators will require that the ECS Administrator remain in
       contact with the SME after reimbursement, in order to collect the data required:
  •	   Description of actual changes made by the SME (e.g. new accounting system; new
       products; expand to more markets; obtain investment finance);
  •	   Increase in sales revenues;
  •	   Increase in export revenues;
  •	   Increase in number of jobs;
  •	   Any repeated use of consulting services.


  2.5.2 Cost effectiveness
  The Economic and Financial Analysis contained in Section 7 of this document includes
  a sensitivity analysis for various assumptions made in design of the project. The analysis
  estimates that the ECS will have a positive net impact if it is able to increase the sales growth
  rate of SMEs by 29% (e.g. raising the annual growth rate from 1% to 1.29%, or from 2% to 2.58%).

  6
    In many voucher schemes, more firms receive vouchers than actually put them to use (due to cold feet, change of circumstances, inability to
  find a satisfactory service provider, etc).
                                                                                               2 - Rationale and Background                  17
                      This target for increases in sales should be taken as a ‘hurdle rate’ for the ECS—i.e. if
                      the rate of a 29% increase in growth rate is not met, then the scheme is not likely to
                      achieve a positive net impact. It is recommended that if this rate is not reached in a given
                      year, a clear action plan should be formed by the ECS Administrator to succeed the following
                      year. If the target value is not reached two years in a row, the scheme should be heavily
                      revised or cancelled, since it is not adequately improving the competitiveness of SMEs.

                      2.5.3 Improvements
                      A systematic assessment of the ECS scheme should be conducted once per year. The
                      assessment should provide recommendations on improving the scheme from year to year.
                      The assessment should review monitoring indicators, and interview a selected number of
                      beneficiaries and service providers to provide feedback so as to make adjustments to the
                      scheme. This assessment can be contracted out by the Marshal’s Office.

                      Depending on the results of the assessment, it is likely that key elements of the
                      scheme can be varied as implementation progresses. In particular, the co-financing rate
                      (public contribution to vouchers) should aim to be reduced over time, as confidence in SMEs
                      builds in the market for consulting services.

                      2.5.4 Evaluation
                      An independent evaluation should be made at the end of the ECS, or every three years
                      (whichever is sooner). This evaluation should include an economic and financial analysis of
                      the scheme, together with recommendations and lessons from the ECS, which can be used
                      to inform future enterprise support schemes either in Eastern Poland or elsewhere.




             2.6 Lessons learned from comparison projects

                      The subsidy aims to respond to opportunities, but it also brings risks (summarized in
                      Figure 2). The scheme is designed to respond to these risks as robustly as possible.

18   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
Several ‘good practices’ of successful comparison projects were incorporated in the design of
this scheme7:
•	   Scheme based on SMEs’ needs analysis (i.e. the scheme design is demand-led);
•	   Clear policy objectives (i.e. increased ability of SMEs to compete successfully);
•	   Simple and clear application criteria, and low-entry barriers compared with traditional
     grant programmes;
•	   Flexibility in use of vouchers (i.e. recipients should have some freedom to decide on the
     best uses);
•	   Availability of an ‘honest broker’ (in the ECS, this is the Independent Advisor (IA))


A lesson from comparator schemes that is not reflected in this design is addressing
supply-side constraints at the same time as demand. Based on experiences with prior
enterprise support schemes globally, it is important to first ensure that there are enough
qualified business support services. This can be done through certification or quality standards
and/or subsidies to providers to develop such services. Accordingly, in preparing the ECS, the
team drafted an extensive section to provide for pre-transaction subsidies to service providers
that respond to an identified gap in the market for consultancy services. However, this
section is not included in the final version of this document, on the decision of the Steering
Committee that other sources of funding (including prior disbursements of the Regional OPs)
have already been used extensively to support service providers, and some other sources of
funding remain for that purpose.8

The team also reviewed other business development voucher programs in Poland for
additional insights to inform the design of this project. Begun in 2008 as a program
of the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development (PAED), these were financed by Polish
government resources. Subsequently, the program was extended (covering options of so-
called ‘small’ and ‘big’ vouchers, depending on the support scale) and continued until 2014-
2015. Simultaneously, similar initiatives were implemented on a regional scale. One of these,
financed under the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) of Kujawsko-Pomorskie (2007-
2013), had a regional Chamber of Commerce manage the voucher program. Some of the
initiatives were evaluated (this was the case of the PAED programs as well as the voucher
mechanism in kujawsko-pomorskie region9). The most important findings of reviews of these
programs were the following:
•	The most crucial ingredient of success is the selection of service providers. Whenever
  possible, the programs should allow only for service providers representing a given
  level of quality and service potential. The selection and verification system is of utmost
  importance to the success of the programme.
•	   The voucher system should specify various types or groups of services and assign
     to them maximum levels of support (public resources co-financing rates). The
     evaluations demonstrate that co-financing (as vouchers) is a strong quality assurance

                       mechanism by giving SMEs a stake in the process. Lower contributions by SMEs (e.g. rates
                       of less than 50%) carry a risk that they do not have a strong interest to offer high-quality
                       services. Typical contributions by SMEs should be around 50%, in order to balance an
                       incentive to participate with an incentive to ensure positive results.
                  •	The voucher systems should be organized to assure fast decision-making processes
                    on applications. Simpler or less costly services should receive a faster decision process on
                    the vouchers.
                  •	There exist various voucher implementation models, including those in which
                    implementation is contracted to an external entity (e.g. in case of Kujawsko-Pomorskie
                    region, an organization external from the managing authority, administered the scheme
                    and managed the funds).
                  •	Adopted solutions were based on the service-costs reimbursement model. This
                    solution is workable, especially in case of smaller vouchers (e.g. 50-100 000 PLN). Higher
                    amounts may necessitate a pre-payment or partial payment mechanism in tranches. This
                    consideration also depends on the type of services eligible for co-financing under a given
                    voucher mechanism).
                  •	To accelerate the vouchers implementation process, the timeframe for services
                    delivery should be limited to programs with potential tangible effects. Therefore, it is
                    important to establish strong indicators for projects financed with vouchers.

                  The system of granting and settling expenditures financed by vouchers should be
                  simple. It should be formalized sufficiently in order to mitigate the risk of fraud or inefficient
                  use of the funds. This is especially important when the implementation process is transferred
                  to an external entity (as was the case of the voucher in Kujawsko-Pomorskie) voivodship.




            2.7 Comparison with other Operational
                Programmes
                  The ECS scheme will co-exist with at least two other Operational Programmes (Ops):
                  Eastern Poland and Rural Development. Some aspects of these OPs are similar to the
                  business support measures proposed here. To avoid duplication, a summary of these OPs was
                  made, and is included for reference.

                  In the Eastern Poland OP:
                  •	   Measure 1.2 supports the improvement of export business models for SMEs. With
                       a budget of approximately 115 million Euro, it provides advisory and financial support
                       in two stages: (i) develop a new business model, based on the internationalization of
                       the SME (up to 50 000 PLN, with public contribution up to 80%); (ii) advisory services,
                       assets (including the purchase of software to support business processes), and travel to
                       implement the business model (up to 500 000 PLN, with public contribution up to 80%).
                       Examples of advisory services include identification of new markets; marketing tools and
                       strategies; finding business partners; adapting products to new markets; or design of an
                       e-commerce solution.
                  •	   Measure 1.3 supports the introduction of new products and the fostering of R&D
                       networks. Applicants for grants for R&D networks should be a consortium of at least five
                       SMEs. The grants can cover services, equipment, construction and property development

20   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
     (up to a limit), and other eligible expenses. The minimum value of eligible expenditures is
     one million PLN, and the maximum is seven million PLN. Co-financing rates from public
     resources ranging from 70% (for investment support) to 85% (for consulting services).
•	   Measure 1.4 supports relatively accomplished SMEs (of at least five employees and sales
     revenue of at least 600 000 PLN), in sectors that are consistent with smart specialization
     priorities. The maximum value of support is 100 000 PLN for Stage I (for financing of a
     ‘design audit’), and three million PLN for Stage 2 (implementation of the design strategy,
     including purchase of machinery, equipment and intellectual property rights). This
     measure carries a budget of more than 144 million Euro.

In the Rural Development OP:
•	   Action 1 provides support for the operation of Local Activity Groups (LAGs), including
     operational expenses and professional development of people involved in the
     implementation of a Local Development Strategy. The support takes the form of a lump
     sum, determined on the basis of the cost of existing LAGs and is dependent on the
     number of citizens living in the area covered by the Local Development Strategy.
•	   Action 2 provides support for the implementation of “cooperation projects.” Cooperation
     projects may involve inter-regional cooperation between LAGs. Support may fund up to
     100% of eligible costs of operations and is paid as reimbursement of costs. The anticipated
     value of each project is at least 50 000 PLN.

The objectives of Measures 1.2 and 1.4 of the Eastern Poland OP are similar to those
of the ECS scheme. However, there are some key differences:
•	   The Eastern Poland OP is substantially more selective: it requires SMEs to be ready to
     export (which is not a requirement that many companies can meet). In contrast, the ECS
     scheme will support a wider range of SMEs, and will help to build a pipeline of SMEs that
     can later apply to the Eastern Poland OP or a similar scheme.
•	   The Eastern Poland OP has a broad range of eligible expenditures (including physical
     investments), whereas the ECS focuses narrowly on business services. The ECS is
     envisaged to solve a specific problem, which is the suboptimal use of business services by
     SMEs in order to improve their operational efficiency, strategic direction, and collaborative
     initiatives—as diagnosed in the analysis and interviews that preceded the ECS, and
     documented in Annexes 1 and 2 of this document.
•	   The Eastern Poland OP concentrates its support in a number of large projects, while the
     ECS will support a larger number of SMEs with smaller contributions. Eligible expenditures
     under the Eastern Poland OP can reach a maximum of 3.1 million PLN per company, while
     eligible expenditures under the ECS can reach a maximum of 200 000 PLN per company.

Finally, there is also some similarity between the ECS and the Baza Usług Rozwojowych
(BUR) schemes, but it should be noted that BUR focuses on training, while the ECS is
geared towards expanding the business services sector. Thus there may be some value
in including BUR service providers in the ECS roster, but the focus of their services is likely to
be different.

Eligibility
criteria




22   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
3.1 Eligible beneficiary SMEs

  Eligible SMEs should fulfill the following criteria:
  •	   Meets standard European criteria to be categorized as an SME;10
  •	   Headquarters or main plant is located in the target region;
  •	   Operational for at least 12 months prior to applying to the ECS scheme;
  •	   Previously received no more than two ECS grants (i.e. maximum three grants can be
       received by a single SME). This criteria would not apply to SMEs that become members of
       a Group services application;
  •	Fulfils de minimis criteria or, if they do not, is classed within article 18 of the Commission
    regulation 651/2014 of 17 June 2014;11
  •	   Engaged in the production of tradable goods and services. Tradable goods and
       services are those that can be traded across geography, rather than produced and
       consumed only in a local market. Examples of tradable goods and services include:
       agricultural products, manufactured goods, ICT services, and tourism. Examples of non-
       tradable goods and services include: retail (shops), taxi services, hairdressing, household
       cleaning services, cafés, plumbing services, and motor vehicle repair. These non-tradable
       goods and services would be excluded from being eligible.

  The exclusive focus on tradable goods and services is for three reasons:
  i.	Tradable goods and services is a reliable way to raise the region’s economic output. They
     increase export revenue, or diminish leakage of income through imports, hence
     contributing most directly to regional income growth.12
  ii.	Firms engaged in producing tradable goods and services are competing predominantly
      with firms outside the poviats and regions. Therefore, support for such firms carries less
      danger of producing a win-lose situation where recipient firms gain at the expense of other
      firms in the same area;
  iii.	Export-oriented tradable goods and services are a route to higher productivity and
       innovation, as has been documented in research literature.13

  This requirement does not mean that recipient firms are already exporters: rather,
  they are engaged in products and value chains that have the potential to be exported.

  In the case of firms that are engaged in non-tradable services as well as tradable goods or
  services (e.g. tourism operator, as well as local taxi services), the application should clearly be
  delineated as being for the tradable part of the business.

  Targeted SMEs. Applicants to the ECS will be scored on several criteria in order to favor
  some categories of SMEs. This approach is already used in the regional OPs, particularly


  10
      As specified here: http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en In brief: less than 250 employees,
  and a turnover of EUR 50 million or less (or balance sheet total of EUR 43 million or less).
  11
     In brief: under de minimis criteria, no more than EUR 200 000 in state aid may be received by the SME in the last three fiscal years. SMEs
  that have already reached that limit would instead fall under the 651/2014 regulation, which stimulates a maximum aid intensity of 50% of the
  expenditure.
  12
     Non-tradable goods and services mainly circulate income around the local economy (through the provision of local goods and services);
  they would expand incomes only if households or firms are consuming more of those services (i.e. eating higher value meals in restaurants;
  having more haircuts per year; cleaning their premises more often). As evident from these examples, economic growth via non-tradable
  goods and services is likely to be marginal rather than substantive, and thus is deemed not to be a strategically strong route to regional
  economic development.

                                                                                                              3 - Eligibility criteria 23
                       Measure 1.4 in Podkarpackie (direct grants for SMEs) and Measure 2.5 in Świętokrzyskie
                       (investment support for SMEs). Under the ECS, these categories could include:
                       •	   Geographical location. Applicants from lagging poviats
                       •	   Business sector. Applicants engaged in business sectors that are consistent with smart
                            specialization priorities could be scored more highly, if required.
                       •	   Size of firm. While the European Union (EU) definition of SMEs includes firms from zero
                            to 249 employees, it is recommended that the ECS scheme subsidize firms between three
                            and 50 employees. Thus, some (but not the smallest) micro-size firms would be included,
                            and firms of less than 50 employees would be advantaged. The rationale for this proposal
                            is as follows:
                            •	   Excluding firms of less than three employees. Ninety-five percent of all firms in the two
                                 regions are micro-size (less than 10 employees).15 The proposal to exclude the smallest
                                 of these micro firms is made because firms of between zero and two employees have
                                 yet to prove themselves capable of scaling-up and contributing to regional job growth.
                                 Opening the program to firms of below three employees will greatly increase the
                                 transactions costs of filtering applications (since there will be a much larger number),
                                 but may not channel funds to firms that have real growth potential. Firms with three to
                                 nine employees can be considered to have ‘self-selected’ as having growth potential,
                                 due to their size.16
                            •	   Preferring firms of less than 50 employees. In view of the wide size bracket for medium
                                 firms (50 to 249 employees), the team did consider whether to exclude medium-size
                                 firms that are larger than, for example, 100 employees, because they already have their
                                 own financial means and technical knowledge to procure business development
                                 services, if and when they are required. However, because medium-size firms are
                                 more likely export, this would not exclude them, but consider them at a lower priority
                                 compared to small-size firms, in order to channel public funds to firms that have the
                                 most limited self-knowledge and financial resources.




              3.2 Eligible and ineligible expenditures

                       ECS funds should be spent on consultancy services that aim to increase the
                       competitiveness of an SME. Demand for these services, according to the team’s background
                       research (see Annex 2), includes the following main areas of consulting services:
                       •	   Production process improvements;
                       •	   Management and administration improvements;
                       •	   Expansion of markets for existing products (including export assistance);
                       •	   Product innovation and differentiation;
                       •	   Legal services;
                       •	   Access to finance for investments;
                       •	   Collaborative initiatives, such as joint product development or regional product branding.
14
   A medium-size firm has less than 250 employees; a small-size firm has less than 50 employees; and a micro-firm has less than 10 employees.
Turnover and balance sheet criteria are also given. See ‘What is an SME?’ article for more details-- http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-

needs, a strict list of eligible services is not provided. Since the ECS is driven by demand,
it is recommended to provide indicative services without adhering to a strict list.

Ineligible expenditures should include the following:18
(i)		 Any goods, machinery or equipment;
(ii)		     Rental of buildings or lease of land;
(iii)		    Lease of tangible and intangible assets;
(iv)		     Non-consulting services (e.g. travel, venue hire, renovation of buildings);
(v)		      Consulting services incurred outside the eligible period (e.g. cost of project preparation);
(vi)		     Operating costs (raw materials, energy,                     fuel,    telecommunications,           heating,
           maintenance, building management, etc.);
(vii)		    Interest on debt;
(viii)		   Contributions to pension or health insurance;
(ix)		     Fines, financial penalties and expenses of litigation;
(x)		      Losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and fees on the exchange rate;
(xi)		     Payments of bonuses to employees;
(xii)		    Bank charges for opening and administering accounts, fees for financial transfers and
           other costs of a financial nature;
(xiii)		   Interest and other financial charges (warranty, etc.);
(xiv)	     Insurance policy charges (including assets acquired from the project);
(xv)		Value Added Tax (VAT) on consultancy services;
(xvi)	     Recipient SMEs’ staff time or services for the project to be implemented;
(xvii)	Consultant services to prepare the application.

Eligible costs are the external fees paid to consultants or other trainers, exclusive of VAT or
other taxes.




17
   These should be for a specific purpose, rather than routine legal services. For example: assistance to negotiate a new or particularly complex
supply contract.
 18
    This is adapted from a list of ineligible expenditures in a similar ERDF call for proposals.


                                                                                                               3 - Eligibility criteria       25

   These window sizes are guidelines and can be reviewed according to demand. The remaining 22% is estimated for overhead costs: the ECS
Administrator; ‘ECS marketplace’ website; IAs; Evaluation Committee; and internal costs of the Marshal’s Offices.
20
   These values show the contribution from public resources. The total size of the services contract will be larger, e.g. the 12 500 PLN maximum
for an operational voucher will yield a 25 000 PLN services contract (@ 50% co-financing rate), and the 120 000 PLN maximum for a strategic
voucher will yield a 200 000 PLN services contract (@ 60% co-financing rate).
                                                                                           4 - Demand-Driven Support for SMEs                 27
                       In each of the three windows, SMEs can apply for partial payment for business
                       consultancy services. Successful applicants will be granted a voucher to use for the
                       services for which they apply. No physical (paper) vouchers will be issued: the voucher is
                       an agreement by the ECS Administrator to reimburse the SME for the partial cost of a
                       contract with a business consultancy service provider. Once the voucher is issued, the SME
                       may decide not to use it for any reason. Reimbursement to SMEs will occur after full delivery
                       of the service, once the provider issues a final invoice.

                       During preparation of this scheme, several options were presented to the Steering
                       Committee, and the Steering Committee expressed its preferences. Those decisions
                       in which clear preferences were expressed are reflected in the design of the scheme. In
                       summary, they are:
                       •	   Service providers will not be limited to BSIs. BSIs will compete with commercial
                            providers of business development and consultancy services, to provide services to SMEs.
                       •	   Service providers will not be limited to those only in Podkarpackie or
                            Świętokrzyskie. In pursuit of greater efficiency and competency, service providers
                            outside the two regions will be able to bid on contracts under the ECS scheme. Service
                            providers based in the two regions may be preferred by the SMEs for some reasons (e.g.
                            proximity, accessibility, prior knowledge, etc), but those from outside the regions will not
                            be excluded from consideration.
                       •	   Some functions to administer the scheme may be contracted out by the Marshal’s
                            Offices, under a management contract. The requirements of the ECS Administrator
                            are detailed in Section 5.1, below.

                       Some other options were considered, but are not proposed for inclusion in the
                       scheme. The following options are not proposed for the following reasons:
                       •	   Variable co-financing rate. Within each of the windows, the co-financing rate could
                            be increased for select categories of SMEs (i.e. those from the poorest poviats). The risk
                            of this approach is that it leads to ‘gaming’ by SMEs—e.g. setting up an office in favored
                            locations. If strong controls are in place, this variable rate could provide more intensive
                            support to SMEs in the poorest areas.
                       •	   Performance contracting. Service providers could be incentivized to exceed
                            expectations by linking their payment to the performance of the SMEs. This approach
                            has been used in some innovative matching grant schemes internationally. For example,
                            service providers could be paid a bonus of 1% of the SME’s profits. Ultimately, SMEs
                            would be free to incorporate it into their contracts, but it is not built into the scheme as a
                            mandatory characteristic (since it may not be suitable in all situations).




               4.1 Operational window

                       The window for Operational services is designed to subsidize smaller, simpler
                       business development services. Examples of such services are as follows:
                       •	   Small-scale marketing plans, website development;
                       •	   Assistance in preparing applications for commercial financing;
                       •	   Legal services; 21
21
  These should be for a specific purpose, rather than routine legal services. For example: assistance to negotiate a new or particularly complex
supply contract.
28   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
•	     Basic assistance in entering foreign markets;
•	     Specialized skills training;
•	     Managerial training.22

Since they are somewhat standardized and commonly known, SMEs will be better equipped
to diagnose its need for such services and to procure them.

4.1.1 Rate of co-financing
The ECS scheme will contribute up to 50% of the value of Operational Services, excluding VAT.

4.1.2 Expected value
The ECS scheme will contribute up to 50% of the value of Operational Services, excluding VAT.
•	     Maximum. The maximum value of the voucher will be 12 500 PLN (2 800 EUR)
       per application—i.e. 50% of a total contract size of 25 000 PLN, excluding VAT.
       Applicants are free to apply for support to contracts at values greater than 25 000 PLN,
       but in those cases, the public contribution in this window will be limited to 12 500 PLN (i.e.
       the applicant would cover more than 50% of the contract value for the larger contracts).
•	     Minimum. A minimum contract size would be set at 5 000 PLN, in order to exclude
       contracts of a negligible size.
•	     Average. We expect the typical voucher to be approximately 11 000 PLN (2 500 EUR),
       given the scope of the services involved, and the willingness of the targeted SMEs to pay.

4.1.3 Maximum duration
The maximum duration of the service provision will be 12 months.

4.1.4 Application process
The application process will be a simple single-stage process, in which the applicant SME
demonstrates formal eligibility of the company and the service.

The application will be made through the online ‘ECS marketplace’ website and accepted on
a rolling basis (i.e. can be submitted at any time). The applicant SME will need to demonstrate
formal eligibility of the company and to describe their needs and desired impact(s) of the
consulting services. The submission will be checked against the eligibility criteria as specified in
Section 3.1 (‘Eligible beneficiar’), focusing on the size of the company, the value of the voucher
requested, and the type of service it will be used for. The number of attachments required
should be limited. The ECS Administrator should aim for a fast-turnaround on every application
(two weeks as a maximum).

4.1.5 Diagnostic process
For simple services, we assume that the SME is capable of diagnosing its own needs. The subsidy
provides a financial incentive for them to use business support services. If the SME meets the
basic eligibility criteria then the application is approved.

4.1.6 Eligibility of service providers
Service providers are required only to register and give their credentials in the online
‘ECS marketplace.’ This information should be sufficient for SMEs to choose a provider,
especially since the basic information will be supplemented with user ratings and comments.


22
     Training services may be removed by the Marshals’ Offices if they are deemed to duplicate training available under the BUR scheme.


                                                                                       4 - Demand-Driven Support for SMEs                 29
                       The ECS Administrator will not be required to approve a service provider before they can
                       enter the marketplace, except to verify that the provider is a legitimate provider of consulting
                       services.23

                       Accreditation or formal quality standards will not be required, though the service
                       provider can choose to mention these on their website in order to attract more interest. Those
                       accredited in the BUR database24 should be automatically registered on the ‘ECS Marketplace’
                       website. It should however be noted that the level of services provided through BUR is likely
                       to be more basic than those required through the ECS.

                       Some additional requirements can be made of service providers at the time of
                       contracting, as specified in Section 6.2 (‘Procurement process’).

                       4.1.7 Quality assurance
                       Quality control will be ensured by two mechanisms:
                       (i)	Basic credentials, and user ratings and comments, on the ‘ECS marketplace’
                           website User feedback will help the SME to assess quality upfront (this will be easier for
                           Operational Services than for Strategic Services, owing to a greater standardization of
                           services).
                       (ii)	Active monitoring by SMEs. The ECS scheme requires some financial contributions
                            from SMEs, therefore the SMEs have a vested interest the good quality delivery of those
                            services. In essence, this joint financing of the services aligns the interests of the Marshal
                            Office and SMEs around good quality services, and thus decentralizes monitoring and
                            quality assurance on the services to the SMEs.

                       4.1.8 Selection of service providers
                       Service providers will be selected in accordance with procurement guidelines
                       detailed in Section 6.2 (‘Procurement process’).

                       4.1.9 Verification and Voucher Reimbursement
                       The ECS Administrator will reimburse SMEs after submission of the following documents:
                       (i)	 Copies of the contract and invoice from the service provider, which is consistent with the
                            approved application for the voucher. The SME is responsible for payment to the service
                            provider;
                       (ii)	 A one-page report produced by the service provider upon completion of the project,
                             detailing the process and outcome. While the bureaucratic requirements of the ECS scheme
                             should be kept to a minimum, this short report is a means to reduce the chance of fraud;
                       (iii)	 Confirmation that the SME submitted a review of the service provider on the ECS
                              marketplace website.

                       Final payment to the service provider will be made by the SME. This payment must
                       be made if the service was compliant with the TOR for the service provider. If the SME is
                       concerned about service quality, they may request an opinion from the IA. This opinion is
                       given informally, but may assist in mediating a payment dispute.

23
   In principle, the ECS Administrator could provide upfront quality control for service providers. However, that option is not proposed here,
given the relatively small size of the scheme compared to the extra costs that vetting would incur. In order to vet service providers, the
Administrator would have had to develop minimum requirements for each service (of which there are many), which is an onerous and
expensive undertaking.
24
   The BUR [Database of Development Services] is a free-of-charge database of service providers in Poland. It is available at the national
level, and lists business services focused on training, vocational courses, counselling, post-graduate studies, mentoring, and coaching. The
database supports SMEs and individual businesses in accessing the most appropriate training and advisory services that can improve their
skills and business operations. The Database Administrator is the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development (PARP). Service providers who are
registered in BUR were verified by PARP, according to their experience, capacity, and quality system. The service provider must demonstrate
implementation of a certified quality system. The list of accepted certificates is published on the PARP website.

4.2 Strategic services

   The window for Strategic support is designed to subsidize strategic consultancy services.
   It will be tailored to the needs of each SME to ensure that they receive the most appropriate
   and highest quality services. Examples of such services are as follows:
   •	   Preparation of complex marketing strategies;
   •	   Production process improvements (cost optimization & efficiency);
   •	   Strategic business planning, product development (branding; differentiation; innovation),
        and market intelligence (competitors + customers);
   •	   Industry trends & technology trends;
   •	   Assistance in entering foreign markets (more complex support than under the Operational
        Services window).25

   On the basis of the team’s background research, SMEs recognize the need for these services,
   yet they are the least willing to pay for them, owing to the perceived high cost and risk of poor
   quality outputs. Nor are SMEs knowledgeable to diagnose their firms’ needs and develop a
   quality scope of work (terms of reference).

   4.2.1 Rate of co-financing
   The ECS scheme will contribute up to 60% of the value of strategic services , excluding VAT.26


   4.2.2 Expected value
   •	   Maximum. The maximum value of the grant will be 120 000 PLN per
        application—i.e. 60% of a total contract size of 200 000 PLN, excluding VAT.
        Applicants are free to apply for support to contracts at values greater than 200 000 PLN,
        but in those cases, the public contribution will be limited at 120 000 PLN (i.e. the applicant
        would cover more than 60% of the contract value for larger contracts).
   •	   Minimum. In order to exclude contracts of that should be in the Operational window
        instead, or which will have only marginal impacts on competitiveness, a minimum voucher
        size could be set, of approximately 15 000 PLN27 (i.e. 60% of a total contract side of 25 000
        PLN, excluding VAT).
   •	   Average. We presume that the average voucher size will be approximately 40 000 PLN
        (9 000 EUR), given the scope of the services involved, and the willingness to pay the
        targeted SMEs.

   4.2.3 Maximum duration
   The maximum duration of the service provision will be 18 months. This is deemed sufficient
   for full delivery of strategic consulting services to an SME.




   25
      Assistance in entering foreign markets may be removed by the Marshals’ Offices if they are deemed to duplicate support available under
   the Eastern Poland Operational Program (POPW). However, there is reason to believe that the targeted beneficiaries under POPW are larger
   or more advanced companies than the potential SMEs of this scheme. See Section 2.7 (‘Comparison with other OPs’) for more details.
   26
      Any SME that cannot fulfil de minimis criteria would be limited to 50% of the value, under the block exemption rule of Commission
   Regulation 651/2014, 17 June 2014.
   27
      Even if the Operational Services voucher has a maximum size of 12 500 PLN, the Strategic services voucher would have a minimum size of 15
   000 PLN rather than 12 500 PLN in order to exclude overlap. (This is because a 12 500 PLN voucher indicates a services contract value of 25 000
   PLN at a 50% co-financing rate, and a 15 000 PLN voucher indicates a services contract value also of 25 000 PLN at a 60% co-financing rate.)

                       4.2.4 Application process
                       The application process will be a two-stage process:28
                       (i)	In the first stage, the applicant SME will need to demonstrate formal eligibility of its
                           company and service. This will be done through an application on the ECS marketplace
                           website, to describe the needs of the company and the desired impact of the consulting
                           services. The submission will be checked against the eligibility criteria as specified in
                           Section 3.1 (‘Eligible beneficiar’), focusing on the size of the company, the value of the
                           voucher requested, and the type of service. The number of attachments required should
                           be limited. The ECS Administrator should aim for a fast-turnaround on every application
                           (maximum of two-three weeks ). Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis.
                       (ii)	 In the second stage, the applicant SME will receive a diagnostic advisory service from
                             the IA. This requirement is based upon the background research done in preparation for
                             this scheme, which found that SMEs tend to have a poor appreciation of the strategic
                             business development services available. The IA will advise the SME on potential services.
                             Revisions to the application may be made at this stage, subject to the SME remaining
                             eligible. The decision on whether to revise the application is the responsibility of the SME;
                             the IA plays only an advisory role.

                       An Evaluation Committee should be comprised of three business people with
                       international experience and/or public officials with substantial private sector
                       experience. A strong understanding of business development and export markets will be
                       important. The Marshal’s Office should appoint the Committee Chair. The time commitment
                       of the Evaluation Committee will be relatively substantial – perhaps two days a month –
                       reflecting the time taken to review and rank applications and attend a monthly meeting.
                       Remuneration for this will be considered an overhead cost to the ECS.

                       An application should be approved only if its benefits are likely to outweigh its public
                       and private costs. For the Strategic and Group windows, a project-scoring schema should
                       be developed to reflect the likely impact of the project and its contribution to the objectives.
                       A pass/fail condition should apply to eligibility. Each member of the Evaluation Committee
                       should independently score project proposals (according to the likelihood of the application
                       to generate the Outcome Indicators specified in Section 2.5 of this document—i.e. increases in
                       sales revenues, export revenues, or number of jobs), and then scores compared.

                       It is recommended that a fixed budget be allocated at each meeting to fund the top rated
                       applications. Where applications are exceptional but cannot be funded in one month,
                       allowance should be made to carry forward applications to the next decision point.

                       This process contrasts with the Operational window, in which applications should be
                       approved based solely on whether they meet the eligibility criteria.

                       4.2.5 Diagnostic process
                       In the Strategic window, the SME should be advised about the benefits of a strategic
                       consultant to help them assess their needs and potential benefits. The voucher
                       provides a substantial financial incentive for the SME to use such services, plus the advisory
                       services of the IA.

                       This diagnostic process should be standardized. Several models for the diagnosis of SMEs
                       are available (such as Growth Mapper,29 Growth Wheel,30 and others). The use of a specific
                       diagnostic process should be specified for the IAs, and basic training should be given in the
                       prescribed technique at the inception stage of the contract between the Marshal’s Office and
28
   Implementation of this process should be made consistent with the respective legal regulations, particularly with the Polish implementing
regulation (ustawa wdrożeniowa), articles 37-51.

the IAs. This diagnostic process is not included in this report, but should be developed in the
Terms of Reference for the IAs.

4.2.6 Eligibility of service providers
Service providers are required to register on the ‘ECS marketplace’ website, as
described in Section 4.1.6 (‘Eligibility of service providers’).

4.2.7 Quality assurance
Quality control will be ensured by three mechanisms:
(i)	Basic credentials plus user ratings and comments on the ‘ECS marketplace’
    website. User feedback will help the SME to assess quality upfront (though this
    will be more difficult than for the Operational Services window, owing to the lack of
    standardization of services).
(ii)	Peer review by the IA. This is proposed because of the relatively complex nature of the
     services. Strategic services are likely to incur more frequent disputes between the SME
     and the service provider about the quality of services provided. The IA will not have formal
     powers, but will advise the SME on whether delivery of the service was satisfactory.
     Contracts can be disputed and payment withheld in case of substandard delivery of the
     services.
(iii)	Active monitoring by SMEs. The ECS scheme requires some financial contributions
      from SMEs, therefore the SMEs have a vested interest the good quality delivery of those
      services. In essence, this joint financing of the services aligns the interests of the Marshal
      Office and SMEs around good quality services, and thus decentralizes monitoring and
      quality assurance on the services to the SMEs.

4.2.8 Selection of service providers

Service providers will be selected in accordance with procurement guidelines, detailed in
Section 6.2 (‘Procurement process’).

4.2.9 Verification and Voucher Reimbursement

Reimbursement for the costs of the contracted service will be made to the SME after
submission of the following documents:
(i)	A copy of the contract and invoice from the service provider, which is consistent with
    the approved application for the voucher. The SME is responsible for payment to the
    service provider;
(ii)	 A short report produced by the service provider, upon completion of the project
      (three pages is a sufficient length), detailing the process and the output. While the
      bureaucratic requirements of the ECS scheme should be kept to a minimum, this short
      report is a means to reduce the chance of fraud;
(iii)	 Confirmation that the SME has submitted a review of the service provider on the ‘ECS
       marketplace’ website.

Final payment to the service provider will be made by the SME. This payment must
be made if the service was compliant with the TORs for the service provider. If the SME is
concerned about service quality, they may request an opinion from the IA. This opinion is
given informally, but may assist in mediating a payment dispute.

In riskier cases (e.g. in high value contracts, or in any other case where the Scheme Administrator
deems there is a risk of fraud), the ECS Administrator may request a second opinion from the IA that
the service was delivered effectively. In other cases, the ECS Administrator should be responsible
for awarding and monitoring the grants, without the need for further technical advice.

                                                                         4 - Demand-Driven Support for SMEs   33
              4.3 Group services

                       The window for Group services is designed to subsidize services provided to a group
                       of SMEs to achieve joint objectives. The grants will solve a problem that stems from SMEs
                       being smaller than the minimum efficient size to procure such services themselves.31
                       •	   Small-scale marketing plans, website development;
                       •	   Assistance in preparing applications for commercial financing;

                       4.3.1 Intended activities
                       Activities to solve common problems may relate to operational efficiency or to
                       strategic choices:

                       Operational efficiencies can be increased through, for example:
                       •	   Joint procurement (e.g. reducing costs of production by procuring supplies collectively
                            at lower prices);
                       •	   Joint lobbying for common needs (to advocate for reforms or investments by local
                            or national decision-makers -- e.g. sector-specific business environment reforms, or
                            investments in shared infrastructure).

                       Strategic improvements could be made through:
                       •	   Development of joint products (such as regional branding for agribusiness products;
                            integrated tourism products which combine agricultural or cultural heritage tours with
                            accommodation and activities);
                       •	   Shared market intelligence or industry trends (the procurement of strategically useful
                            information which can be interpreted by each SME according to their own needs, but is
                            not viable for individual SMEs to commission on their own).

                       A subsidy is required to solve a coordination failure - whereby SMEs recognize the
                       potential benefits from such services, but are disinclined to procure them because of the
                       transaction costs in arranging a group of SMEs to work together, and because of the risk of
                       ‘free-riding’ where other SMEs benefit from the service but have not contributed to its costs.

                       If the subsidy is successful, the beneficiary SMEs should be willing to scale-up their
                       own financial contributions, so that the Group service continues even once the
                       subsidy ends. This scenario may sound unlikely for BSIs who have become accustomed
                       to 100% public subsidies, but international experience does demonstrate it is frequently
                       achieved.32 Within Świętokrzyskie, inspiration can be found in the example of SanExport
                       (located in Sandomierz powiat). SanExport is a limited liability company, established by in 2011
                       as a collective of dessert apples producers, to expand their exports. With four full-time staff,33 it
                       supports activities such as contract negotiations (usually pursued on behalf of a large number
                       of producers, so that they gain more market power to negotiate with overseas buyers).

31
   In most cases, these shared services will fall into two categories (best defined using their technical terms):
•	    ‘common services’ (those which are diminished through their use, yet are difficult or impossible to exclude others from ‘free-riding’—i.e.
      rivalrous but non-excludable);
•	    ‘club services’ (those which are not diminished through their use, but which can be provided to the exclusion of others—i.e. non-rivalrous
      but excludable).
By contrast, services that are rivalrous and excludable are ‘private services’, and services that are non-rivalrous and non-excludable are ‘public
goods.’
32
   According to an international survey of cluster initiatives, approximately 34% of revenues come from private sources such as membership
fees and sales of services. This finding is shown in Lindqvist G., Ketels C., Sölvell Ö., (2013) The Cluster Initiative Greenbook 2.0; Ivory Tower
Publishers, Stockholm.
33
   This information was gathered through an interview with SanExport.
34   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
Successful activities are likely to support a group of SMEs in a long-term initiative. A
more stable structure (funded by membership fees or other means) could oversee repeated,
iterative activities that support the continual evolution of a group of SMEs. This has been
the experience with the most successful cluster initiatives in Europe and elsewhere. But a
key lesson from cluster initiatives is that the most successful initiatives start with specific
activities, rather than starting with an institutionalized organization.34 It is important to
demonstrate value first; then the administrative arrangements can come later.

4.3.2 Initiators
Based on their needs assessment, consortia of SMEs will propose joint services to
solve shared problems. This allows the emergence of group service proposals without
an expensive prior competitiveness analysis.35 However, it also carries a risk because SMEs’
will be limited in their knowledge of xxx, and may not take a sufficiently long-term view on
opportunities for commercial sustainability.36 Therefore, it is recommended that the IA assist
the ECS Administrator with assessing the commercial sense of such proposals.

It should be anticipated that a larger group of SMEs (e.g. 10 SMEs and upwards) might
prefer to engage a service provider (e.g. a BSI) to organize the application for Group
services and transactions with the services provider. In this case, the operational costs
of the BSI can be included in the value of the proposal. The service itself could be provided
by the same service provider (i.e. BSI is the initiator and the provider), or by another service
provider (i.e. BSI is merely an organizer and convener of outsourced services).

4.3.3 Eligible beneficiaries
Each shared service must respond to the needs of a minimum of three SMEs. Potential
beneficiaries should be groups of SMEs operating in the same locality or belonging to the
same or complementary sector of a business activity. The group may be led by an SME, BSI,
or another organizational entity acting as a consortium leader (e.g. a Chamber of Commerce/
industry, sector association, or educational establishment).

4.3.4 Rate of co-financing
The ECS scheme will contribute up to 85% of the value of Group services. The
beneficiary SMEs must pay the remainder.37 This relatively high cofinancing rate of 85 percent
is proposed because of the increased difficulty of encouraging financial contributions from
SMEs to Group activities. The Group services window is designed to provide a large financial



34
   This observation may help explain the weak results of cluster initiatives in previous OPs, and the distaste for cluster initiatives in OP 2014-
2020. According to an evaluation of cluster initiatives, only 20% of targeted enterprises actually reported benefits from the initiatives-- PSDB
(2013), ‘Ewaluacja: Jak zmieniają sie klustry dzięki wsparciu z PO RPW [Evaluation: How do the clusters supported by the OP EPD changed?]’,

35
   An alternative option was considered during preparation of this report: a ‘Directed Call’, in which the Marshal’s Office is the initiator, and
opens a call for proposals to solve a specific problem of competitiveness, which is identified by industry diagnostics and analysis. This approach
would prioritize specific sectors which the Marshal’s Office believes carry commercial opportunities (e.g. the smart specialization sectors), but
requires additional analysis in order to identify specific shared constraints and problems that a shared service can help resolve. In practice,
this process would be outsourced by the Marshal’s Office to a strategic consultant, who should be given terms of reference to identify
opportunities for increased competitiveness within specific sectors of the economy. However, this option is not favoured, because of the extra
complexity and expense that it would involve.
36
   We anticipate this problem on the basis of international experience with the initiatives proposed by SMEs. There is a tendency for SMEs to
prioritize measures, which lower costs of production, but not those that pivot their businesses and change their markets. The latter is difficult
for SMEs to see when they are focused on paying their bills and earning enough revenue to make it through the year, even if it may be more
lucrative in the long-term.
37
   SMEs that cannot fulfill de minimis criteria would be limited to 50% of the value, under the block exemption rule of Commission Regulation
651/2014, 17 June 2014. That means the 85% co-financing rate must be adjusted on a pro rata basis, proportionately to the value of the Group
application of those SMEs.

                       The total permitted value of the project (i.e. the ECS contribution, plus private contributions)
                       should depend on the number of SMEs involved. The upper limit for value per firm could be:
                       •	        30 000 PLN per micro enterprise;
                       •	        40 000 PLN per small enterprise;
                       •	        50 000 PLN per medium enterprise.38

                       The maximum value of the Group services voucher will be 2 million PLN —i.e. 85% of
                       a total contract size of 2 352 941 PLN, excluding VAT.39 Most, if not all, projects would not be
                       close to this threshold, because of the limits on value per firm.40

                       The minimum value of the Group voucher will be 120 000 PLN, in order to exclude
                       contracts that are of negligible value and/or benefit fewer than three SMEs at once.

                       4.3.6 Maximum duration
                       The maximum duration of the service provision will be 24 months. This duration is proposed
                       because of the risk of ceasing a joint service before its value has become apparent to SMEs.

                       4.3.7 Application process
                       A group of SMEs will apply for a Group services’ voucher. Their application will be assessed using
                       the same method as for Strategic services, as described in Section 4.2.4 (‘Application process’).

                       4.3.8 Diagnostic process
                       A group of SMEs submitting a joint application will be responsible for the initial
                       diagnostic work necessary to put together their application. These costs would not
                       be subsidized, though the services of an IA can be requested if the group of SMEs can
                       demonstrate that they fulfill the basic eligibility criteria for beneficiaries (see Section 3.1:
                       ’Eligible beneficiar’)41.

                       4.3.9 Eligibility of service providers
                       Service providers are required to register on the ‘ECS marketplace’ website, as
                       described in Section 4.1.6 (‘Eligibility of service providers’).

                       4.3.10 Quality assurance
                       Quality control will be ensured by three mechanisms:
                       (i)	 Basic credentials plus user ratings and comments on the ‘ECS marketplace’
38
   These upper limits are suggestions and can be revised slightly. They are proposed in order to ensure that Group services applications benefit
a sufficient number of SMEs to be desirable investments with public funds. We do not recommend removing the limits entirely, since that will
remove the discipline of making the Group services demand-led by SMEs.
39
   2 000 000 PLN is 85% of 2 352 941 PLN.
40
   For example, a Group services application would require 50 small-size firms in order to reach the value of 2 million PLN.
41
   In the alternative option discussed for Group services (‘directed call’), the diagnostic would be undertaken by the Marshal’s Office (or a
strategic consultant). In case this option is ever reconsidered in future, that process is noted here for reference:
•	    Mapping of current economic activity in the targeted economic sector;
•	    Review of relevant industry trends and emergent commercial opportunities for targeted firms to differentiate themselves and earn a
      higher profit margin;
•	    Review of the needs of advanced buyers in order to identify key priorities for targeted firms;
•	    Benchmarking of the current activities of firms, and conclusion about priority interventions (to be conducted by public and private
      sectors in partnership).
This methodology is based on the European Foundation for Cluster Excellence (EFCE), and describes the key steps in a ‘competitiveness
reinforcement initiative.’ The EFCE previously provided training in Podkarpackie (see http://www.clusterexcellence.org/podkarpacka-cluster-
academy/). The staff trained in this program should be able to refine and finalize the terms of reference—or even to conduct the work
themselves. The topics for this diagnostic work should be determined upfront by the Marshal’s Office, most likely in industries and sectors
consistent with the Smart Specialisation strategy—leading to perhaps one call per industry or sector.

      website. This user feedback will help the group of SMEs assess quality.
(ii)	 Peer review by the IA. Peer review is proposed because of the relatively complex nature
      of Group services. The IA will not have a formal ‘sign off’ role, but will assist the ECS
      Administrator in verifying the correct use of the grant for eligible expenditures.
(iii)	Active monitoring by SMEs. The ECS scheme requires some financial contributions
      from SMEs, therefore the SMEs have a vested interest the good quality delivery of those
      services. In essence, this joint financing of the services aligns the interests of the Marshal
      Office and SMEs around good quality services, and thus decentralizes monitoring and
      quality assurance on the services to the SMEs.

4.3.11 Selection of service providers
Service providers will be selected in accordance with procurement guidelines detailed in
Section 6.2 (‘Procurement process’).

A detailed budget must be prepared by service providers, and may include direct
costs as well as operational costs (overheads) .42

4.3.12 Verification and payments
In consortium awards, it is anticipated there will be a single Lead Entity (SME, BSI,
or other organization) that acts as the contracting body on behalf of the group of
SMEs. The Lead Entity would contract a service provider on behalf of the consortium. The
Marshal’s Office reimbursement agreement (‘voucher’) would be with the Lead entity of the
consortium. The Lead Entity will be responsible for monitoring service delivery to partner
firms, ensuring sign-off, and collecting firms’ contributions. An allowance of (maximum) 5% of
the total service cost may be paid to the Lead entity for undertaking this administration. This
will be paid quarterly in arrears spread over the lifetime of the project. It should be considered
as an overhead to be paid by the ECS on top of the value of the Group services voucher.

Reimbursement (for the costs of the contracted service) will be made to the Lead Entity after
submission of the following documents:
(i)	 A copy of the contract and a copy of the invoice from the service provider, which is
     consistent with the approved application for the voucher;
(ii)	 A short report produced by the service provider on completion of the project (three
      pages are sufficient) detailing the process that was undertaken and the output that was
      produced.
(iii)	Confirmation that the entity representing the SMEs has submitted a review of the
      service provider on the online ‘ECS marketplace’ website;
(iv)	Confirmation of the financial contribution of at least 15% of all member SMEs in the
     Group. This financial record must be reviewed closely in order to ensure that the service
     has genuinely benefited the applicant group. If a member SME leaves the group or
     does not pay their contribution, the total size of the ECS reimbursement must
     also be reduced accordingly.43

Final payment to the service provider will be made by the Lead Entity. This payment
must be made if the service was compliant with the TORs for the service provider. If the
Group is concerned about service quality, the Lead entity may request an opinion from the IA.
This opinion is given informally, but may assist in mediating a payment dispute.

In higher risk cases (e.g. in high value contracts, or in any other case deemed to have a potential
42
   According to the current interpretation of ERDF rules, reimbursement is based on actual costs. But this will be a strong disincentive for
service providers, who must also cover overheads and operational costs. Therefore, it would be highly desirable for reimbursement to be
permitted on the full development cost (including staff time, overheads, and operational costs). The reasonableness of these costs will be
determined through the bidding process.
43
   This condition is important, in order to ensure that the Group services voucher meets its objective of providing a service that is of value to
the whole group of SMEs.
                                                                                       4 - Demand-Driven Support for SMEs 37
                       risk of fraud), the ECS Administrator may request a second opinion from the IA that the service
                       was delivered effectively. In other cases, the ECS Administrator should be responsible for
                       awarding and monitoring the grants, without needing further technical advice.

                       The Administrator and the beneficiary, on a case-by-case basis, will determine a
                       payment schedule to the service provider. In view of the larger size of the contract, a
                       staggered disbursement schedule may be useful. For example:
                       •	   10% at signing of the contract;
                       •	   60% to be paid in tranches during delivery of the contract, on a case-by-case basis, as
                            determined by a schedule, according to technical content of the subproject;
                       •	   30% on satisfactory completion of the contract (verified by the IA).

                       4.3.13 Monitoring and feedback
                       The service provider should produce a report every three months detailing the process that
                       is being undertaken and the output that is produced. The purpose of this report is: (i) to
                       document outputs and outcomes of the project; and (ii) to verify correct usage of the funds.




              4.4 Repayable vouchers?

                       In preparing the ECS, some alternatives were considered but rejected. One of these was the
                       idea of conditionally repayable funds. The essentials of this idea are recorded here in case of
                       a potential subsequent scheme.

                       Repayable vouchers tailor the subsidy level to the actual needs of the SME. This
                       solution responds to one of the trickiest decisions in any voucher or matching grant scheme—
                       to decide on the rate of co-financing, which must be sufficiently high to incentivize SMEs to
                       use the scheme, but not so high as to be an inefficient use of public resources. Unfortunately
                       that optimal rate of co-financing is likely to be different for every SME, which makes it
                       almost impossible for the voucher scheme to be truly efficient. By contrast, under ‘repayable
                       vouchers,’ the co-financing rate can initially be set high, and then decreased, according to
                       the impact of the voucher on SME revenues. Thus, subsidies will be larger for those SMEs
                       for whom the enterprise support did not work, and less for SMEs for whom the enterprise
                       support was effective.

                       In a repayable vouchers scheme: if the grant is successful, SME revenue grows, a
                       portion of which can be repaid to the publicly funded voucher scheme. The public
                       sector still provides the subsidy (voucher), but where SME revenues grow as a result, some
                       of those benefits can be recouped, This will benefit both entities because repayment will
                       maximize and prolong the impact of the voucher scheme, since funds would be partially
                       replenished over time by repayments.

                       Repayable vouchers would be based on international the experiences of Revenue-
                       Based Financing (RBF). RBF has been utilized commercially and by public bodies in the
                       United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, and Serbia, amongst
                       others.44 The basic principles are as follows:
43
   This condition is important, in order to ensure that the Group services voucher meets its objective of providing a service that is of value to
the whole group of SMEs.
44
   Baptista, António (2015), ‘Revenue-Based Financing in the SME Universe’, part of Benchmarking SME Support Programs, commissioned by
the World Bank, mimeo. Traditionally, RBF has been used mainly in high margin and/or capital-intensive sectors (e.g. ICT, biotech, etc)--- but
some RBF firms have tweaked their model to make it viable to a wider array of sectors (i.e. by extending the maturity, and lowering the cost
of capital).
38 i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
•	    In RBF, (usually in the form of loans), capital is repaid if the investment is successful,
      but is not repaid if the investment fails. The repayment occurs as a percentage of
      revenues (i.e. if revenues dip, for whatever reason, the repayment stops).
•	    When commercial providers use RBF, they set the effective interest rate higher than a
      bank loan, but at a lesser cost than giving equity to investors. The cost of borrowing
      reflects the additional risk taken on by the lender (higher risk than a loan, which must be
      repaid by the SME whatever happens to their revenues). Thus, the downside risk is
      transferred from the SME to the lender.

When adapting RBF in the form of a repayable voucher, some modifications could be
made:
•	    It would not need to be entirely commercially profitable, but would focus on
      extending the life and cost-effectiveness of the funds. The use of a partially repayable
      mode is to recoup some of the benefits where SMEs are successful. Its cost effectiveness
      for taxpayers would thus be higher than distributing vouchers/grants to SMEs as a one-
      time disbursement.
•	    The percentage of revenues taken as repayment from the SME could focus on
      extra revenues. Most RBF schemes take a percentage of SME revenues (e.g. 3% of SME
      revenues). In a repayable voucher scheme, a percentage of extra revenues could be taken
      (i.e. repayment only on the portion of revenues that increase, owing to the subsidized
      investments).
•	    Traditionally RBF is used to pay back the entire investment—but in a voucher
      scheme the repayment could be capped (e.g. SME repays a maximum of 50% of
      the voucher value). The cap would be made in order to further incentivize the SME to
      choose to invest in consulting services and other eligible services in the first place (i.e. to
      demonstrate that it will always be better off, whether repayments are due or not).

Repayable vouchers appear to be possible under EU funding, according to the
relevant guidance documents.45

And, based on team discussions and feedback from the Steering Committee,
repayable vouchers are not proposed for the initial version of the ECS scheme. The
main reason for caution is that repayment conditions will risk dis-incentivizing SMEs from
applying for vouchers. This risk stems from the following contextual conditions in Eastern
Poland:
i.	   SMEs are hesitant to use consultancy services of the type that this scheme will support,
      and are skeptical that the services will be valuable. Repayment conditions could further
      complicate this decision.
ii.	 SMEs are habituated to receiving free (grant) support from public authorities, and will not
     find repayable support attractive.
iii.	 Even if increased revenues are achieved, it will be difficult or impossible to attribute them
      to services received (since they could also have been caused by other investments, e.g.
      machinery, equipment, premises). So SMEs may perceive it as unfair to expect repayment
      for these services when the revenue increase may actually have been from goods
      investment.

Overall, even if repayable vouchers are not incorporated in this first version of
the ECS, conditional repayment could be incorporated in subsequent years of the
scheme, once confidence in the scheme has built amongst SMEs.

Four key parties will be required for the ECS scheme to function successfully:
(i)	 ECS Administrator;
(ii)	IA;
(iii)	 ‘ECS marketplace’ website;
(iv)	 Service providers.

The first three of these will comprise the management costs of the scheme, and can
be considered as overheads. In a total program of 18 million EUR per year, these costs could
constitute approximately 15% of the value of the scheme (approximately 2% to 8% for the
ECS Administrator, 3% for the IAs, 1% for the website, plus costs within the Marshal’s Office to
establish the scheme).

The functions of these four parties are represented in Figure 3 below, and are described in
detail in the following sections.

            5.1	 ECS Administrator

                  The objective of the ECS Administrator will be to ensure the functioning of the scheme,
                  including making adjustments to it, if needed. It requires the following responsibilities:
                  •	   Prior revision of OP plans, if necessary;
                  •	   Publicity and promotion of the scheme;
                  •	   Administration of vouchers, including selection of successful applicants, quality control,
                       payments and financial control;
                  •	   Maintenance of online ‘marketplace’ platform;
                  •	   Monitoring and evaluation of the program to increase efficiency.

                  The Marshal Offices could fulfill most of these tasks, or contract them to an external
                  entity. Such scheme will have to be in conformity with the Common Provisions Regulation
                  and the State Aid Regulation.

                  The following tasks would be required from the administrator of the scheme.
                  According to preliminary discussions with the Marshal Offices, tasks (1) [revision of ROPs] and
                  (5) [evaluation] might be managed directly, while the other tasks would be contracted to a
                  consulting firm or BSI. If contracted out, the contract value for the ECS Administrator might
                  range between 2 and 8% of the total value of the ECS budget, depending on the scope of
                  work. These tasks are as follows:

                  1. Preconditions and establishment of the ECS. The requirements for this activity will
                  be determined by the Managing Authority, but will likely include: revisions to some ROP
                  documents; preparation of the detailed implementation arrangements; and procurement of
                  the IAs, ECS Marketplace, and Evaluation Committee consultants. These tasks may include
                  (for example):
                  a.	 Revisions to ROPs’ “Detailed description of priority axes” document, reflecting new
                      contents of the Programs’ Measure(s) (or sub-Measures) under which the new support
                      transfer models will be carried out. A decision must be made on sources of finance for
                      the new models (voucher / collective services), and on the final amounts of public sources
                      available for implementation of the new models (including the internal allocation for
                      voucher models vs. delivery of collective services). It may also be necessary to specify the
                      means of selection for the ECS Administrator, since non-competitive procurement has
                      been discussed.
                  b.	 ROPs implementation schedules to incorporate the ECS and its related provisions (for
                      example: activation of the online ‘marketplace’ to support implementation).
                  c.	 Public documents containing information regarding access to support under the ECS.
                  d.	Legal documents for granting support under the new models and settling the utilization
                     of the support on the side of the final beneficiary (documents fulfilling requirements
                     being in line with respective conditions / requirements for EU structural funds utilization
                     of support in favor of SMEs under regional programs).
                  e.	 ROPs’ implementation guidelines to reflect specific features of the ECS.

2. Administering the ECS scheme. Administrative mechanisms for implementation and
day-to-day management would include:
a.	 Assignment of staff with appropriate experience to monitor and oversee the tasks
    described here;
b.	 Selection and procurement of IAs, as specified in Section 5.2 (‘Independent Advisor’);
c.	Selection and procurement of a service provider to establish and maintain the online ‘ECS
   marketplace’ website’, as specified in Section 5.3 ( ‘ECS marketplace’);
d.	 Oversight of the procurement process for service providers;
e.	 Administration of the financial reimbursement of SMEs as described in those same sections.
f.	Provision of a grievance redress mechanism. A standard mechanism as per administration
   of EU Funds can be used. It should specify the redress mechanism, which can be used
   by SMEs to dispute a negative decision on their application, and by service providers to
   dispute a negative decision on a contract for which they bid. Standard procedures for
   public procurement and EU Structural Funds may be used.

3. Designing, approving, and implementing a communications plan to promote the
ECS to its intended beneficiaries. The objective of this activity is to raise the interest of
potential beneficiaries in using the ECS measures. The plan would likely include:
a.	Targeting SMEs: publicizing the availability of the ECS, including through the marketing
   channels used for promotion of ROPs, with special emphasis on promoting the ‘ECS
   marketplace’ website; organizing and implementing promotional events for SMEs in the
   two regions, through membership-based business organizations and BSIs; and raising
   awareness amongst entrepreneurs about potential benefits from using business
   development consulting services. This may include a summary of the results of work of
   selected service providers (and similar results from locations outside Poland) in order to
   stimulate the other SMEs to benefit from such services and to take part in the support
   scheme.
b.	Targeting service providers: inform key potential service providers (within the two
   regions and outside of them), probably by e-mail, followed up by telephone calls.

Both channels above should mention the ECS marketplace website as a source of further
information.

4. Day-to-day monitoring of the ECS. Indicators to monitor are described in Section 2.5
(‘Monitoring, Evaluation & Improvements’).

5. Yearly assessment of the ECS, to adjust implementation arrangements, and ensure
a positive impact. In preparing the ECS, an economic and financial analysis was undertaken
(as reported in Section 7 ‘Economic and Financial Analysis’); however it is only an estimate,
done before the scheme is initialized. A yearly assessment, on the basis of detailed monitoring
data, will permit the Marshal’s Offices to determine the cost-effectiveness of the ECS, and to
make necessary adjustments. Further details are recommended in Section 2.5 (‘Monitoring,
Evaluation & Improvements’).

Any person or company fulfilling the role of ECS Administrator must be prohibited
from working as an IA or as Service Provider, in order to avoid a conflict of interest.




                                                                              5 - Roles and Responsibilities   43
            5.2 Independent Advisor

                  The objective of the IA is to catalyze the ECS system. It will be achieved by advisory
                  services to SMEs to improve the efficiency of their choices, and to the Marshal’s Office to
                  improve the efficiency of delivery of services. In essence, the IA acts as a ‘broker’ to ensure
                  a smooth transaction between the SME, the service provider, and the ECS Administrator.

                  5.2.1 Main tasks
                  The IA will focus on five main tasks.

                  The first task is mandatory for all applications by SMEs for Strategic services. The other four
                  tasks are optional and will be performed only if the SME requests them.
                  (I)	 Assist SMEs in diagnosing needs. As part of the application process for the Strategic
                       Services window, SMEs must receive an assessment from the IA about their needs for
                       business advisory services. This requirement is made on the basis of the background
                       research done in preparation of this scheme, which found that SMEs tend to have a
                       relatively poor appreciation of the strategic business development services available. The
                       IA should make recommendations tailored to the needs of each SME, to encourage growth
                       in the following areas: jobs, sales revenue, exports, and/or productivity. The application
                       will include a score from the IA about the strength of the application, according to their
                       diagnostic. The IA should focus on increasing the value of the benefit from the service
                       provision.
                  (II)	 A simplified version of a standard methodology should be employed for the
                        diagnosis. Several models for diagnosis of SMEs are available (such as Growth Mapper, ,
                        Growth Wheel, and others). The use of a particular process should be specified in the TOR
                        for the IAs, and basic training should be given in the prescribed technique at the inception
                        stage of the contract between the Marshal’s Office and the IAs. The diagnostic method
                        must be simple enough that it can be applied within one day of onsite meetings by the IA
                        with SME managers and other key staff, plus analysis of any existing company documents
                        that are made available for the IA (company strategy, quality, management policy, etc.).
                  (III)	Assisting SMEs in preparing applications to the ECS. It is likely that this role would
                        focus mainly on complex services (of which SMEs may not be sufficiently knowledgeable
                        before receiving the service), but it could be requested by the SME for Operational
                        services too. The IA would help the SME write TOR for the service provider (description
                        of tasks, and description of the expected output), according to the needs of the SME and
                        its strategy. This external, professional assistance would increase the quality of the service
                        contract and will aim to increase the likely satisfaction of the SME with the service. SMEs
                        should pass the first-stage of the application process (formal eligibility) before being
                        able to benefit from the IA’s services, in order to optimize the time expended by IAs.
                  (IV)	Assisting SMEs in selecting a service provider. Upon request by the SME, IAs may
                       advise them on selecting a suitable service provider. This assistance will be available only
                       for service orders over a specific value (e.g. more than 50 000 PLN). The advisory role
                       brings two advantages: the IA may be more experienced than the SME in use of the
                       service, and thus be able to advise on a qualified provider; the IA may know the needs of
                       the SME well, especially if he/she assisted in the diagnosis and application preparation.
                       Nevertheless, the SME is ultimately responsible for selection of a service provider.
                  (V)	 Assisting SMEs in monitoring and mediating the quality of service provision. If the
                       SME is concerned about service quality, they may request active monitoring of the service
                       by an IA. The IA may assist the SME in querying the quality or other aspect of the service

44   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
       that does not conform to the terms of reference. In case of continued problems, the IA
       would mediate between the SME and the service provider, and could act as an impartial
       arbiter in case of a payment dispute.

The ECS Administrator, rather than the SME, can request a further task from the IA:
(VI)	Assist the Administrator in verifying delivery of the required service. The
     Administrator may request a second opinion (beyond that of the SME) that the service
     was effective. This option can be utilized in high value contracts, or in any other case
     where the ECS Administrator deems there is a risk of fraud (e.g. the SME indicates delivery
     of a service they never received, in order to receive the subsidy). In other cases, the Scheme
     Administrator should be responsible for awarding and monitoring the grants, without
     needing further technical advice.

The IA would be contracted on a retainer basis, and would be paid at an hourly or daily
rate. The IA would invoice the ECS Administrator for advisory services on a standard schedule
(e.g. verification of a service received by an SME: maximum four hours, plus travel time).

The total costs for the IA contracts are estimated in Table 3, below. The estimates are
approximate and depend on three main factors:
•	     Cost of services. We assume 400-600 PLN per day for a reasonably experienced and
       knowledgeable local consulting firm.
•	     Labour intensity of the given service. The relatively low-number of person days per SME
       is proposed to keep down the transaction costs for the Strategic services window. These
       can be re-assessed after the first year of implementation, if necessary.
•	     Total number of SMEs served. This depends on demand, but here we use estimates that
       are consistent with the economic and financial analysis of the project.

                  The IAs should use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to determine contractors. KPIs
                  would likely be as follows: number of SMEs served; number of service providers selected with
                  the IA assistance; and number of service outputs verified. If appropriate, ratings of IAs can
                  be given by SMEs, and this information would be utilised by the ECS Administrator to take
                  decisions about the renewal of IA contracts.

                  5.2.2 Procurement requirements
                  The IA will be contracted using public funds—i.e. no payments will be collected from
                  SMEs using the scheme. In this sense, the IA can be considered as a ‘free service’ provided
                  to SMEs, to audit their needs and to improve their satisfaction with the ECS.

                  The IA will be selected competitively, based on the following criteria.

                  Formal (‘entry’) criteria:
                  The IA will likely be a commercial entity or a BSI, able to provide its services via a competent
                  group of consultants.
                  •	   Experience in providing consulting services to the SMEs;
                  •	   Minimum turnover for last year (e.g. 1 000 000 PLN);
                  •	   Experience in identifying SME needs;
                  •	   Ability to provide three to six experienced experts, fulfilling certain formal criteria.

                  Technical criteria:
                  The Scheme Administrator should select the IAs according to competitive tender. The
                  following criteria and weightings could be used:
                  •	   Price (according to a standardized schedule of services provided by the IA) (30%);
                  •	   Proposed methodology of identifying SME needs (20%);
                  •	   Proposed rules of cooperation with the SME (how to provide effective communication,
                       how to involve SME representatives in preparation of the necessary documents etc.) and
                       of fulfilling its expectations (30%);
                  •	   Proposed methodology/scope of assessing quality of the outputs prepared by the service
                       provider (20%).

                  5.2.3 Exclusions
                  IAs will not be permitted to recommend service providers with whom they have any
                  commercial, family, or other institutionalized relations. That scenario would constitute
                  a conflict of interest, where the IA recommends a service provider with whom they have
                  a vested interest. The ECS Administrator will be responsible for preventing this conflict of
                  interest, by maintaining a register of all service providers with whom each IA (or staff
                  thereof) has a relationship, and ensuring that those service providers never feature in the IA’s
                  recommendations. The register should be revised on the basis of any confirmed report from a
                  member of the public or other source of information, should that happen.

                  IAs will not be permitted to make any use of the commercial information they
                  learn during the course of their work with an SME. The IA and its experts should sign a
                  confidentiality declaration, concerning utilization of information collected during their work
                  with a given SME.




46   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
5.3 ‘ECS marketplace’ website

  The objective of the ‘ECS marketplace’ website is to provide an efficient way for
  SMEs to find and procure the best service provider for their needs, as specified in this
  section. It should be operational by the first day of the scheme, or before—preferably with at
  least 25 service providers pre-registered (by invitation) in order to demonstrate credibility of
  the program.48

  Creation of the website is likely to be procured from a website design firm. The firm
  should be capable of producing a website that provides information; includes a searchable
  database (of service providers and of IAs); permits an interactive ratings system, including
  comments from SMEs that have utilized the services; and includes an online application
  system for SMEs and for service providers to be registered on the website and to manage
  transactions for using the vouchers.

  Ideally, there would be a single website for both regions. This would be more efficient
  because it would streamline the sign up process for service providers and create a single,
  larger database of service provides. However, a single website is unlikely to be possible in
  practice: joint procurement of the website development and maintenance is complicated
  and there will be some differences between the ECS implemented by each region.

  If a single website is not possible, it is recommended that each region’s website
  has reviews of service providers from the other regions’ and the BUR49 websites.
  This feature would allow SMEs to see a greater number of reviews, and thus gather more
  information on service providers before making their choice.

  The cost of design and maintenance of the ‘ECS marketplace’ is estimated to be between 120
  000 and 160 000 PLN annually.

  Draft specifications for the website are presented, below, for the TOR for the contractor:

  I. General description of the voucher program (welcome page). Description of general
  goals and logic of the support delivery mechanism. Short description of roles of entities
  engaged in implementation of the program, especially the role of service providers and IAs.

This list is provided for the convenience of the Marshal’s Offices when procuring
the website design. It should be regarded as a minimum specification. The site should
meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 standard.

During the design of this scheme, a question was raised about the risk that the online ‘ECS
marketplace’ might restrict the choice of service providers. Its objective is precisely the
opposite by presenting a number of options and an easy method for comparing service
providers without the SME having to engage in a costly search process that is limited by their
own time and knowledge. If the SME favors a service provider that is not already registered
in the ‘ECS marketplace,’ they would encourage that service provider to register in order to be
considered eligible for procurement.

Another question was raised about the sustainability of the platform. The online ‘ECS
marketplace’ would require some ongoing maintenance costs (in terms of web-hosting,
curation, and updates), but this should be of marginal value compared to the initial costs of
creating it. To reduce costs, there are enough common features that the website can be built
for both Marshals’ Offices at once.

                                                                                   5 - Roles and Responsibilities   49
           5.4 Service providers
               (and transition arrangements for BSIs)
                  Eligible service providers in the ECS scheme will not be limited to BSIs alone:
                  commercial providers such as consulting firms will be able to bid for contracts, on
                  the same terms as BSIs. This decision is taken in pursuit of an efficient and effective market
                  for business development services. The movement to demand-based vouchers, as envisaged
                  by the ECS scheme, will be accompanied by more competition in the supply of services.

                  This transition will not be easy for BSIs. Our background research on BSIs in Podkarpackie
                  and Świętokrzyskie (see Annex 3) shows that few BSIs are skilled in responding to market
                  needs, according to demand from SMEs. In view of the large number of BSIs that already
                  exist, and which are largely dependent on public funding, it can be anticipated that some will
                  become insolvent.

                  5.4.1 History and current situation
                  BSIs have existed since the early 1990s, through publicly-funded initiatives
                  supporting local economic development and entrepreneurship. Their number has
                  grown substantially since Poland acceded to the EU, and many of these institutions have
                  evolved since that time, improving their capacity and skills. Another group of BSIs emerged in
                  the 2000s to operate economic infrastructure investments, such as technological parks and
                  enterprise incubators. The key role of BSIs was to help companies, especially SMEs, adapt to
                  the rules of the market economy, the functioning of the EU single market, and growth and
                  innovation opportunities.

                  BSIs have become particularly adept at implementing projects financed by EU Funds.
                  Through recent ROPs, each BSI prepares its own project in response to a call for proposals,
                  in which the Implementing Body defines the scope of work and services for SMEs that were
                  expected from the BSI. The project defines the tasks , expected results, and budget of the
                  project (i.e. the costs of individual tasks and cost of project management). Projects are not
                  permitted to generate profit, and cover only the actual costs incurred (in accordance with the
                  invoices, which had to be shown in final or midterm reports). BSI overheads are paid at a flat
                  rate of 3-7%.

                  Based on prior experiences, the scope and scale of most BSI activities depends heavily
                  on public-financing, especially through European funds. Incentives for BSIs to operate
                  on a commercial basis are relatively limited, particularly for the following reasons:
                  •	   Broad access by SMEs to subsidized services
                  •	   Low demand by SMEs for business support services at market prices

                  Under the ECS scheme, SMEs could demand services from BSIs upon receipt of EU subsidies
                  targeted at them. Indeed, owing to the high availability of EU subsidies, it is perceived that
                  SMEs’ demand for services is strongly determined by which ones are subsidized.

                  As a result, most BSIs focus on these publicly-funded services, with relatively few
                  offered on a commercial basis (usually those not offered under public programs).
                  Revenues generated by commercially-provided services constitute only a small part of general
                  revenues. The main type of service providing a substantial share of revenues is the preparation
                  of applications for EU funds.

                  BSIs’ current service offering includes:
                  •	   Information publicly-funded support programs for SMEs;

50   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
•	   Preparation of applications for EU and other public funds;
•	   Training for SMEs’ staff;
•	   Regional development services / elaboration of local development plans;
•	   Advisory services;
•	   Financial instruments – loans and guarantees;
•	   Provision of office and production space for SMEs;
•	   Assistance in entering foreign markets;
•	   Provision of book-keeping services.

Most BSIs provide general services and do not specialize in any specific economic
sector or type of service. This helps the BSIs to diversify their offerings and strengthen
their sustainability through economic declines, but can make it more difficult to achieve a
comparative advantage on the market.

This low-level of specialization also means that BSIs’ services are rather basic, and
only some of them are able to provide more advanced services. Most BSIs declare a
capacity to mobilize high-class experts, if such a need would arise. But interviews with SMEs
reveal that they perceive BSIs’ services of poor quality.

Quality assurance mechanisms are not well developed. Few BSIs monitor the satisfaction
of their clients or evaluate the impact of their services on enterprises’ economic outcomes.
Hardly any BSIs interviewed for this project publish reports on their websites about their
activities, based on monitoring or evaluation (e.g. information about the number of enterprises
supported, or jobs created).

Some prior projects have encouraged BSIs to develop commercial activities, but have
not been widely successful. Mostly because of increasing pressure from the European
Commission, several attempts have been made to commercialize BSIs’ services, but in general
these have not been very successful. These attempts included piloting some services assumed
to be realistic for future commercialization.50 One explanation for the lack of success is that the
servicemarketing component was somehow neglected; but a more convincing explanation
seems to be the underdevelopment of a commercial market for such services, combined with
the simultaneous access of SMEs to subsidized services.

Implementation of a demand-driven approach to the financing of business support
services would require a lot of effort and preparation on the side of existing BSIs.
These efforts should include building closer links with enterprises and capacity for tailored,
accessible, services for enterprises. In the long term, this can help to build a more advanced
market for such services and may have a positive impact on the regional economy; however,
in the short term, it will be painful for many BSIs.

5.4.2 Transition arrangements for BSIs
In a relatively short space of time, BSIs will need to transform their operating model
to be commercially viable. Either they should become conventional enterprises—most
likely specializing in business development services and other consultancy services—or they
should become membership organizations providing shared services; or some combination
of the two.

  For example, tested services included: (1) ‘Consulting and training service concerning optimization of managing enterprise finance’, (2)
“Consulting service concerning marketing and sales of products for firm operating in the food-processing branch; individual marketing
plan for a firm”, (3) ‘Consulting and training service concerning managing the energy efficiency on the level of an enterprise, (4) ‘Pilot service
concerning application of information technologies for the enterprise management needs”, (5) “Planning enterprise development and utilizing
repayable funding sources.” https://www.parp.gov.pl/files/74/81/626/19707.pdf

                                                                                                    5 - Roles and Responsibilities             51
                   Several models do exist for commercially viable industry support organizations. Many
                   such organizations have diversified their financing sources to a mix of public and private
                   sources. Sources of private funding may include:
                   •	   Membership fees. Membership fees are paid by each enterprise covered by collective
                        services. Fees can vary according to the turnover of each company, or according to
                        numbers of employees, or some other method for categorizing members. The fee usually
                        covers club services (close to public goods).
                   •	   Service-related fees. Service-related fees are paid by enterprises on a ‘per service’ basis—
                        for example, for participation in trade missions or receipt of training. These types of fees are
                        usually related to private services (i.e. those that can be provided to individual companies,
                        rather than group services).
                   •	   Other revenue-generating activities. Such activities may include the leasing of office or
                        commercial premises or venture capital (angel investments or other equity investments).
                        Some BSIs in Podkarpackie and Świętokrzyskie already engage in such activities.

                   How can this transition be assisted?
                   •	   In Świętokrzyskie, substantial funds are channeled towards BSIs in 2016.This includes
                        two calls for proposals for SW ROP measures 1.3 and 2.1 with the goal of professionalizing
                        BSIs to deliver specialized services, tailored to the needs of firms. Grants under the measures
                        cover up to 85% of costs, and BSIs are expected to contribute 15% of their own resources. BSIs
                        prepare projects by presenting the competencies they need to acquire in order to generate
                        value for businesses, together with a plan to acquire those new skills and the costs that are
                        associated with it. In these activities, BSIs receive grants only if they specify clear objectives
                        and expected results. BSIs are anticipated to specialize in provision of specific services.

                        In order to assist the transition of BSIs towards a commercial approach, it is
                        recommended that the Marshal’s Offices inform BSIs about the substantial
                        differences in subsequent calls for proposals after 2016. The proposals should have
                        initiatives that will offer financial support to help BSIs become more commercially viable
                        by specializing in services demanded by SMEs. In 2017, if the ECS scheme elaborated
                        in this document is put into practice, BSIs must be able to compete in the marketplace
                        with commercial consultancy firms in winning contracts for service provision, and must
                        be attractive enough that SMEs are willing to contribute some financial resources to
                        the costs of services provision. It should be clear to BSIs that they need to use funding
                        available this year to transform their organization in order to compete in that market.

                   •	   In Podkarpackie, no BSI support schemes are currently financed within ROP.
                        Thus, BSIs should be ready for to move towards the commercialization of their services.

                        The region’s authorities plan to build a regional system of service providers to support
                        SMEs with high-quality advisory services. The system will concentrate on the fulfillment
                        of SMEs’ needs using a demand-driven approach (SMEs choose service providers and
                        public financing will cover a portion of the costs). Existing BSIs are considered potential
                        service providers, but will be in competition with other service providers present on the
                        private market.

5.4.3 Accreditation of service providers
During discussions with the Marshal’s Offices and the European Commission,
questions were raised about ensuring that service providers are accredited.
Accreditation of BSIs aims to provide SMEs with access to high-quality services provided
by institutions that demonstrate certain operating standards, and adequate potential and
resources.

However, there is a fundamental problem that mandatory accreditation will be (i)
costly, and (ii) complex. Preparing an accreditation system necessitates the development
of minimum requirements for the delivery of certain services. In view of the broad range of
consulting and advisory services available under this scheme, that process could be lengthy
and difficult to specify.

In view of these difficulties, it is proposed that accreditation requirements depend
on existing schemes. Pre-existing national accreditation schemes can be used, such as BUR,
created by PAED, or the system of accreditation implemented by the Ministry of Development
for those implementing pro-innovative services.

It is recommended that quality accreditation requirements are optional rather than
mandatory. SMEs will make their own assessment of the most qualified service provider,
based on their needs. Quality will be assured by three mechanisms:
1.	 The ‘ECS marketplace’ website, which includes reviews and basic information about the
    service provider.
2.	 The IA, which can be requested by the SME to provide quality control on provision of the
    services.
3.	 The SME will have a strong interest in monitoring quality of the services provided (owing to
    its own financial contributions), and would terminate the contract in case of unsatisfactory
    delivery.

6.1 Flow of Funds

  Two alternative models are presented here. Figure 4 shows the basic model, with some
  possible variations. Overall, Model 1 is recommended for the scheme.
  •	   Model 1 (basic model)
  	    The overall system is based on reimbursement of costs. An SME utilizing the
       voucher will be responsible for selecting the service provider, ordering the
       requested service, accepting its quality and paying the provider. The ‘voucher’
       provides an agreement between the Marshal’s Office and the SME that the MO
       will partially reimburse the SME for the costs of the services procured (subject to
       the thresholds, co-financing rate, and eligible services specified in the voucher).

       The appointed IAs, acting as ‘brokers,’ to lubricate the transaction between the SME,
       service provider, and ECS Administrator, will support implementation of the service.

       After delivery of the services, the SME will be reimbursed by the Marshal’s Office, once
       delivery of the service is properly evidenced with accounting documents confirming the
       payment settlement. The SME will apply for the service costs reimbursement directly to
       the ECS Administrator or to the Managing Authority (depending on the configuration of
       financial responsibilities decided by the Marshal’s Office before launching the scheme)
  •	   Model 2
  	    In this alternative model, the flow of financial support for the SME (as beneficiary
       of the ECS) is directed to the service provider. Services will be paid partially by the
       Managing Authority and partially by the SME (two transactions per service). The public
       contribution will be specified in the voucher. This solution implies the adoption of a
       tripartite agreement at the beginning of the process, stipulating rules and conditions
       of implementation of the supported advisory services. This also means that the
       service provider will have to be selected by an SME at the initial phase of the process.

       Similar to the previous model, the IA, acting as a ‘broker,’ will assist the process.

       The advantage of this scheme is that the ECS Administrator would have fewer payees
       to deal with (a smaller number of service providers than the number of SMEs). On the
       other hand, both the financial transactions (partial payment by two parties of a single
       contract), and verification (the ECS Administrator will still need to confirm with the SME
       and by other methods the full delivery of the service before issuing payment) will be more
       complex.

6.2 Procurement process

   Procurements of service providers should be made according to the guidelines on
   selection of external service providers prepared by the relevant Managing Authority.51
   The relevant guidelines are formulated for procurements by entities (such as most SMEs) that
   are not obliged to use the Polish procurement law regulations (referred to as PZP). These
   guidelines describe the procurement procedures for selection of service providers and are
   rather similar to the PZP regulations, but are substantially simplified.

   In summary, the following procedures are usually specified:
   a)	 For contracts with a value exceeding 50 000 PLN: Tender Procedure (TP)52
   b)	For contracts with a value between 10 000 PLN and 50 000 PLN: Simplified Tender
      Procedure (STP)
   c)	 For contracts with a value below 10 000 PLN: Call for Quotations (CQ)

   If possible, the ECS scheme should utilize several revisions to the standard
   procedures:
   •	   Selection of a service provider from those registered on the online ‘ECS
        marketplace’ website. Technically, this may be a deviation from the guidelines, and the
        Managing Authority should confirm that it is possible. On the surface, it does not seem
        to be an important problem, although this issue has to be described in the respective
        guidelines, presenting rules of application and ways of taking part in the support schemed
        concerned.
   •	   Increasing the threshold for the CQ procedure, up to a maximum of 20 000 PLN
        (instead of 10 000 PLN).

   Several other standard features for the procurement procedures should be noted:
   •	   Publication of tenders. According to the procurement guidelines the formation
        about the competition and about the process of selection of service provider has to be
        published on the dedicated website run by the Ministry of Economic Development (TP)
        or by the Marshal’s Office (STP). Minimum time between the publication and deadline
        for submission of the proposals should take seven days. For CQ procurements, it is not
        necessary to provide elaborated selection procedures, besides written proof that the call
        for quotation was sent to at least of three potential service providers.
   •	   Conflict of interest. Service providers taking part in the tender/competitive procedures
        have to sign a declaration that they are not related (legally or personally) to the SME and
        there is no threat of possible conflict of interest. Also the SME representative taking part in
        service provider selection has to sign impartiality declarations.
   •	   Scope of work / Terms of Reference. The scope of work for the potential service provider
        should be clear and detailed and should not prefer (directly or indirectly) any potential
        service provider. For bigger projects, additional support for the preparation of the scope
        of work and selection criteria can be provided by the IA, selected by the Marshal’s Office.

                        SME representatives make the selection decision. The guidelines do not require any
                        specific procedure.53

                        The selection criteria should be proposed by the SME for each selection, and should be broken
                        down into formal (entry) criteria and technical criteria:

                        Formal (“entry”) criteria:54
                        •	   Experience within the last five years in the provision of consulting (or other) services in
                             the area expected by the SME, proven by documents (e.g. references) issued by entities
                             purchasing the given service from the service provider.
                        •	   Ability to provide experienced expert/s, proven by his/her CV attached.

                        Technical criteria:55
                        •	   Price (40-70%)56
                        •	   Short analysis of the area within which the service would be provided: given branch or
                             market description, analysis of the given problem (20-30%)
                        •	   Proposed way of providing the given service (10-20%)
                        •	   Short description of contents of the final product - report, analysis – if applicable (10-20%)
                        •	   Experience of the service provider in the given area (10-20%)57
                        •	   Experience of the experts proposed in the given area (10-20%)58

                        The contract will be signed between the SME and the service provider. The ECS
                        Administrator will pay the value of the voucher to the SME when the conditions for payment
                        specified under each window have been fulfilled (these conditions are described in Sections
                        4.1.9, 4.2.9, and 4.3.12 respectively for Operational, Strategic, and Group vouchers).




53
   In public procurements, it is a relatively standard practice to take such procurement decisions by a committee of at least 3 persons, accompanied
by written evidence (decision signed by the selection committee). However, as far as the team understand, this is not strictly required.
54
   Using formal criteria is recommended but not compulsory.
55
    The guidelines are not clear if it is possible to use criteria related to the experience of service provider and experts; such criteria are not
allowed within PZP (except for training services).
56
   In principle, price can be the only criterion for services below 50 000 PLN, but this should not be recommended. In practice, the weighting
assigned to a price criterion may depend on the intensity of the co-financing. A lower contribution from the ECS scheme would probably
cause the SME to assign more importance to price, since the SME would benefit less from a subsidy.

                    The proposed enterprise support scheme will finance vouchers for different types of business
                    development services to SMEs producing tradable goods and services in the Podkarpackie
                    and Swietokrzyskie regions of Poland, with the goal of enhancing the output of the businesses
                    and their contribution to the economic growth in the two regions. The project is expected to
                    disburse 10 million Euro between the two regions over two years, which will be awarded in
                    the form of approximately 1,000 Operational vouchers, with expected rate of co-financing of
                    50%, and approximately 830 Strategic vouchers, with expected rate of co-financing of 60%.

                    In the economic analysis of this project, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is calculated over
                    three years due to the project’s short implementation timeline and the marginal improvements
                    expected from the supported services (e.g. the program is not targeted at innovation). The
                    ERR in the model is expected to be 72% with an NPV of 13.3 million Euro at a 10%
                    discount rate. (This discount rate is set deliberately high in order to provide a conservative
                    NPV). The overall income increase of beneficiary enterprises due to voucher support exceeds
                    the cost of the program. The various assumptions underlying the model and analysis of their
                    sensitivity is included, below.

                    The Economic and Financial Analysis focuses on Operational and Strategic vouchers. The gains
                    from Group services should be tracked over time, but are less accurate to forecast upfront,
                    and have not been included here.

                    7.1.1 Assumptions
                    a.	 The data on turnover, value added, and growth rates are taken from the Euro Stat
                        database. An average level of turnover, growth rate in turnover, and value added per
                        firm, for each category of size of firm, is calculated based on the trend from 2010 to 2014
                        (last available data) and is then projected forward as the trend in the baseline scenario.
                        Regional data on average turnover per size of firm was not readily available for the two
                        regions of focus, so the sensitivity of the baseline average level of turnover is tested to
                        highlight the potentially lower baseline average turnover in the two regions.
                    b.	 Receiving business development services through the voucher scheme is expected to
                        enhance the beneficiaries’ average turnover. As different size firms have varying average
                        growth rates, the impact of voucher support is estimated separately for each size of firm
                        and is assumed to lead to a 50% increase in growth rates over the baseline trend.
                    c.	 The program will include micro firms but will not target them disproportionately, so
                        the initial model assumes that 244 vouchers will be received by firms with zero to nine
                        employees, 566 by firms with 10 to 19 employees, 566 vouchers by firms with 20 to 49,
                        and the remaining 456 by firms with 50 to 249 employees.
                    d.	 The effect of the voucher on turnover growth is assumed to last two years, after which
                        point the boost from the service received dissipates and their growth rate defaults back
                        to the long term trend. 80% of vouchers are assumed to be successfully implemented and
                        to lead to turnover growth above trend.

7.1.2 Costs
The costs of the program are a sum of investment costs, which include the cost of the vouchers
(we assume 10 million Euro over two years),59 as well as the matching contribution from the
private sector, estimated at approximately 7.5 million Euro over two years, assuming a 50%
co-financing rate for Operational services and 60% rate for Strategic services. In addition, the
operating costs of the scheme are assumed to be equivalent to 20% of the voucher cost, the
average operating cost of similar projects in Europe. This cost includes the administration of
calls for proposal, reviews by expert judges, and regular monitoring, and will be 2 million Euro
over two years. The overall costs also include implicit costs such as the opportunity costs of
management time to prepare a proposal and to report regularly to the program administrator.
They are estimated to be 5% of voucher costs, totaling 0.5 million Euro. In sum, the present
value of all costs is 17.4 million Euro, using a 10% discount rate.

7.1.3 Sensitivity analysis

a.	 Starting average level of turnover. If the baseline average turnover per firm is 10%
    lower than assumed across all firm sizes, the ERR reduces to 58% and the NPV to
    10.2 million Euro, and if the baseline average turnover is 30% lower, the ERR is further
    reduced to 30% and the NPV to 4.1 million Euro. The NPV turns negative if the
    baseline average turnover per firm is about 56% of the level assumed in the model.

b.	 Growth rate of turnover. If the growth rate of turnover after the voucher is
    only 40% higher than it was at baseline, the ERR lowers to 44% and the NPV
    to 7.1 million Euro. The hurdle rate for the NPV to turn negative is a growth
    rate after the voucher that is 29% higher than the baseline growth rate.

c.	 Average size of grants. If the average cost of Operational services (assumed to be 5,000
    Euro in the base model) increases to 10,000 Euro, the ERR of the program becomes 52%
    and the NPV is 8.9 million Euro. If the average size of Strategic services (assumed to be
    15,000 Euro in the base model) is instead increased to 20,000 Euro, the ERR becomes
    47% and the NPV is 7.8 million Euro. The NPV of the program turns negative if the
    average size of Strategic services exceeds 38,000 Euro (keeping average for Operational
    services at 5,000 Euro). The NPV also turns negative if average size of Operational grant
    is increased to 9,000 Euro and average size of Strategic grant is increased to 26,000 Euro.

   The EFA examines only the Simple and Strategic vouchers (which are anticipated to account for approximately EUR 14 million of the EUR 18
million program). The benefits from Group services are less accurate to forecast upfront.
                                                                                      7 - Economic and Financial Analysis                61
                   d.	 Distribution of grants between different sizes of firms. If Operational services were heavily
                       targeted at micro firms (zero to nine employees) and they received a total of 560 Operational
                       service grants (instead of the 160 in the base model), the ERR of the scheme is still very
                       positive at 56% with a NPV of 9.8 million Euro. If Strategic services were less heavily biased
                       towards medium-size firms (50 to 249 employees), and they only received 167 grants (instead
                       of the 416 in the base model), the ERR decreases to 27% and the NPV to 3.4 million Euro.

                   e.	 Share of successfully implemented grants. Reducing the share of successfully implemented
                       grants to 70% for each year of implementation, reduces the ERR to 55% and the NPV to
                       9.4 million Euro. A 60% rate of successful implementation further reduces the ERR to 37%
                       and the NPV to 5.6 million Euro. The NPV of the scheme turns negative when only 45%
                       of vouchers each year are successfully implemented, with all else remaining constant.

                   f.	 Years of additionality. If the additional growth in average turnover, due to the use of the
                       voucher service, lasts one year instead of the assumed two, the ERR of the projects is
                       reduced to 40% and the NPV is 5.7 million Euro. As the size and growth rates of turnover
                       are reported annually, we cannot calculate the hurdle rate of the additionality in terms of
                       fractions of a year, but if it only lasts a year, the hurdle rate for the scheme to have negative
                       NPV is a growth rate after the voucher that is 38% higher than the baseline growth rate.

Introduction
This report constitutes the first of the following two milestones in Activity 2 of the Trust Fund named above, due
at end-September 2016:

   1.	 Short analysis of SMEs’ characteristics in the selected areas based on available quantitative data as well
       as gathered qualitative information. This activity will have as a distinct output a short report prepared by
       the Bank on the characteristics and needs of SMEs in the two selected poviats. (Research note 1)

   1.	 Analysis of the qualitative information gathered from a sample of SMEs in the region on entrepreneurial
       readiness and identification of measures to increase access to services to activate/enhance entrepreneurship
       in SMEs. In addition, the issue of accessing EU funds by SMEs in the regions will be analyzed. This activity
       will have as a distinct output a short report prepared by the Bank identifying key barriers to entrepreneurial
       activity and with recommendations for enhancing entrepreneurial activity in the region and for making
       the access to EU funds easier for SMEs. (Research note 2)

64   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
         In this section, we use secondary data to summarize quantitatively the characteristics of firms,
         particularly SMEs, in the two regions.




         Intensity of entrepreneurial activity

         Overall, Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie exhibit a lower than average intensity of
         entrepreneurial activity. Using Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS) data, summarized
         in Figure 1, we can see that Podkarpackie region ranks last in Poland in terms of number
         of registered enterprises per capita and number of start-ups (in 2015). Swietokrzyskie ranks
         marginally better, being a few places from the bottom in two rankings respectively. In both
         regions roughly half as many new businesses are registered per capita as in Mazowieckie.

         Entrepreneurial activity tends to concentrate in urban and peri-urban areas of the
         two regions. As shown in Figure 2, Rzeszow and Kielce have the highest rate of start-ups
         in their regions, followed by secondary cities, and then the suburbs of the main urban areas.
         The only major exception to this rule among both regions is the Bieszczady Mountains region,
         where the concentration of start-ups is particularly high. We suppose this reflects the strong
         specialization of the area in tourism, which is a rapidly growing industry.

                           Size distribution of enterprises is similar to the national average. In both regions micro
                           enterprises (0-10) account for 95% of all of the registered enterprises, and more than 99% of
                           enterprises fit the definition of SMEs, which is consistent with the national picture1. Data on
                           employment by size of enterprise is not available, thus we cannot fully assess the contribution
                           of businesses of different sizes to the local economy. Table 1 provides this data in summary form.

Structure of the economy by sector

Agriculture remains the predominant form of economic activity for the population
of Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie—and even more so in the four poviats. Analysis
of sectoral structure of employment (shown in Table 2) reveals that agriculture accounts for
one-sixth of jobs nationwide, one-third in the two regions, and around half or more in the
four poviats. Meanwhile, services accounts for a smaller share of employment than in the rest
of the country, particularly in financial other high value services, where the four poviats show

                       The high share of agriculture in employment should be caveated, since this may
                       represent hidden unemployment. The southeast of Poland has the highest rates of
                       employment per unit of farmland, as shown in Figure 3. This raises the possibility that a large
                       proportion of the working age population maybe underemployed, or engaged in subsistence
                       or small scale low productivity agriculture, due to lack of other economic opportunities.

                       Analyzing economic output by sector provides a more reliable picture, and indicates
                       some areas of specialization. Our analysis2—shown in Table 3—implies that Podkarpackie has
                       a strong specialization in manufacturing of transport equipment and significant specialization
                       in manufacturing of motor vehicles. Other areas of specialization in Podkarpackie regions
                       (manufacturing of plastic and rubber and non-metallic products) may also benefit from the
                       links with the aerospace supply chain. In Swietokrzyskie no sector reveals such a strong
                       level of specialization. The most overrepresented industry, according to LQ ratios is wood
                       products, which however only employs 5000 people. The largest industry of specialization is
                       manufacturing of food products.

                       Conversely it is notable that several sectors are substantially underrepresented in
                       the two regions. The same Table shows the relative absence of industrial sectors such as
                       telecommunications, TV and film industries, architecture and engineering, scientific research
                       and development, and computer programming. This is troubling, especially if such sectors are
                       considered as a proxy for the level of innovation.

  Here we use Location Quotient (LQ) analysis using total output by 3-digit sectors. LQs help evaluate the structure of economic activity in
a given geographical area compared to the rest of country. They are calculated as the ratio of the share of employment or output (in this
case, we use output) that a given sector contributes in the regions and the share the same sector contributes nationwide. LQ values above
“1” indicate that the industry is overrepresented, and can be considered an industry of specialization; values below 1 indicate the industry is
underrepresented. The larger the LQ – the more pronounced is specialization of the region in a given industry; and vice versa.

Examining at a more detailed level, we find some variation between communes in the
four poviats, but a general pattern of sectors consistent with the region-wide trends
above. This analysis is shown in Table 4. Key trends are for food and beverages, wood and
furniture, metal production, chemicals, and repair of machines.

Finally, we note the relative lack of exported output from Podkarpackie, and
particularly from Swietokrzyskie. As shown in Figure 4, exports form a relatively low
share of GDP in both regions of interest. This is problematic, since exports have a symbiotic
relationship with firm-level productivity and innovation—as has been well documented3. The
lack of exports means that firms in those two regions are stuck in a catch-22 situation: they
are missing out on opportunities to innovate and sustain their competitiveness, which further
disadvantages them in export markets.

Nevertheless, it is impressive that Swietokrzyskie—and especially the two poviats of
our focus—have been increasing exports at a faster rate than nationwide in Poland.
In other words, exports in those poviats are ‘catching up’ with the rest of Poland (but from
a very much lower level: there is a long way to go). This data is shown in the green column
in Table 5. Unfortunately in Podkarpackie, exports are increasing, but at a slower rate than
nationwide—hence the region is falling further behind national rates of exports. It must also
be remarked that Sandomierz poviat has achieved a much higher level of exports per capita
than Swietokrzyskie region on average. Given it is a relatively small poviat, we may presume
this is from the influence of a relatively small number of successfully exporting firms.

  Expanding and diversifying exports is closely related with increasing productivity and fostering innovation. The fact that the more
productive firms are more likely to export has now been confirmed in studies for a large number of countries by Wagner (2007). On the other
hand, exporters tend to be more productive than non-exporters, as documented by Bernard and Jensen (1995, 1999, 2004a and 2004b). A
robust, positive relationship between firm level innovation and productivity as well as some innovation inputs, such as R&D and productivity
has been documented by Hall (2011) and Hall et al (2011), respectively. Product innovations such as the upgrading of the quality of existing
goods or services allow companies to escape competition by differentiating their products as discussed by Cusolito (2009) and Bloom, et al.
(2012). Product innovations, like the creation of new goods, also help firms diversify their portfolios, conquer new markets, and reduce the
effects of external shocks (Klinger and Lederman, 2006).

Unfortunately, exports were not resilient to economic shocks. As can be seen in Figure
5, Staszowski and Sandomierski poviats experienced a fast increase in exports during the
period 2005-07, but a sharp drop during 2007-09. Similar (though slightly less extreme)
fluctuations were observed in Brzozowski and Lezajski poviats—as shown in the same Figure.

74   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas   2 - Rationale and Background
In this section, we report the findings from our work under this intermediate stage of Activity
2, which aims to gain a more solid understanding of the characteristics and needs of SMEs.
These findings will form the foundation for development of a menu of enterprise support
services under the subsequent stage of Activity 2.




Interview Methodology

We developed a plan to interview 40 firms in the two voivodeships4 (8-12 in each
poviat). As noted in the inception report, firms were to be selected through purposive
sampling, to focus on firms that possess characteristics of most interest to this work. The
selection criteria were:
•	     producing tradable goods or services5, in sectors in line with local specializations;
•	     being micro, small or medium-sized.

The focus on tradable goods and services is for three main reasons:

       (i)	 firms engaged in producing tradable goods and services are competing
            predominantly with firms outside the poviats and regions: their market is by
            definition regional, national or even international. Hence support to such firms carries
            less danger of producing a win-lose situation where recipient firms gain at the expense
            of other firms in the same area;

       (ii)	 tradable goods and services, in being export-oriented, offer a route to higher
             productivity and innovation, as has been well-documented in research literature
             (see footnote 3);

       (iii)	tradable goods and services by definition either increase export revenue, or
             diminish leakage of income through imports, hence contributing most directly to
             regional income growth. In other words, tradable goods and services offer a reliable
             pathway to regional catch-up

The interview guide is annexed to this document in Annex 1.

The distribution of interviews across the poviats and firm size categories is summarized in Table 8.

  Tradable goods and services are those that can be traded across geography, rather than produced and consumed only in a local market.
•	   Examples of tradable goods and services would include: agricultural products, manufactured goods, ICT services, tourism, and others.
•	   Examples of non-tradable goods and services would include: hairdressing; household cleaning; plumbing.

                       We wish to note that the process of obtaining interviews was not always easy. Many
                       firms approached refused a meeting. Reasons for refusal were mainly: they were too busy
                       to meet; they did not anticipate any value from the meeting; they had committed time
                       previously to interviews yet never saw anything in terms of follow-ups; they declared they
                       do not need public assistance; and they do not experience problems accessing bank loans.

                       Firms were selected through recommendations by poviat authorities according to
                       their records on which firms were active in such industries. Any remaining gaps were
                       then filled through internet searches on appropriate companies.

                       In terms of industry, firms tended to be active in the following areas (consistent with the local
                       economic specializations of the poviats):

                       •	   Brzozow: most companies interviewed were active in metal processing, furniture, wood
                            products (including housing), food production, and packaging materials industries.

                       •	   Leżajsk: most companies interviewed were active in metal processing, furniture, and
                            construction industries.

                       •	   Sandomierz: most companies interviewed were active either in the apple production
                            industry (apple growing, sorting, and juices) or in tourism.

                       •	   Staszow: most companies interviewed were active in manufacturing and in construction
                            services. We were unable to interview firms involved in food processing, despite this sector
                            being part of the poviat strategy: such firms were located but refused to participate in the
                            interviews.

                       Detailed summaries of all interviews were prepared (3-4 pages per company, for all
                       interviews) in order to ensure a rigorous analysis of the interview data. These summaries
                       include: the strategic direction of the company; the company’s evolution over time; its main
                       strategic and operational concerns; and its needs and desires for support services. In order
                       to respect our assurance to companies that their views will be treated anonymously, these
                       summaries are not annexed here, and will be kept confidential6. A list of firms interviewed is
                       provided in Annex 2.




                       Contextual observations on SME
                       characteristics and needs
                       Based on these qualitative interviews, some observations can be made about the characteristics
                       and needs of SMEs in the two regions. This qualitative data enriches and deepens the
                       quantitative data presented in the first section of this document. Key insights are as follows.


                       1	         Firms in both regions do have some potential to increase their growth in
                                  tradable goods and services. We were inspired by a number of remarkable and
                                  successful firms, such as the following:

                                  (a)	 a meat processing plant emphasizing traditional meat products produced in a
                                       traditional and high quality way—which has expanded regularly during its 17-year
                                       existence and sells to approximately 300 shops;

6
 In a larger study area it might be realistic to ‘sanitize’ the interview findings and remove company names, but in this small study area it would
still be easy for readers to infer which firm gave which interview.
76   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
     (b)	 a processor of cabbages and cucumbers (producing approximately 5500 tonnes
          per year), employing 30 full-time employees, and exporting through commercial
          networks and across Europe;

     (c)	 a group of fruit producers specializing in dessert apples, harnessing approximately
          940 hectares of orchards and selling to Eastern Europe and Central Asia;

     (d)	 a small firm producing natural, cloudy apple juice using an innovative method
          which does not require preservatives yet has a shelf-life of 12 months and stays
          fresh up to 14 days after opening;

     (e)	 a manufacturer of components for water filtration and separation, with applications
          in mining, chemical, food, and electricity generation, employing more than 240
          people and having evolved since its establishment in 1982, most recently into
          architectural applications of wire mesh and welded wire.




2	   Many firms in the four poviats have already been attempting to expand,
     though their attempts have not always been successful. For example:

     (a)	 a processed food manufacturer tried selling online, but customers were not
          accustomed to buying such products directly online, preferring shops instead;

     (b)	 a confectionary firm opened, then closed, a shop in Rzeszów because it could not
          adequately supervise quality handling of the goods by sales staff.



 	   Almost all interviewed firms noted how ‘competitive’ their sector was.
3    However: usually that is because they have not sufficiently differentiated
     their product. In many cases, firms are aiming to compete mainly on price, without
     fully differentiating their product from competitors. Occasionally companies have
     managed to demonstrate quality, but they remain in markets where only minimal
     quality standards are required, and competition is predominantly on costs and price.
     For example:

     (a)	 tourism operators compete downwards their price and aim to receive good
          reviews on booking.com, but have made only limited investigations to launch
          more attractive products, such as integrated hotel and niche tourism offerings
          (e.g. ‘wellness’ weekends; guided circuits; etc).

     (b)	manufacturers of construction materials and components are competing
         predominantly on cost, since large construction firms have accumulated the
         power to set price for their suppliers;

     (c)	 manufacturers of furniture and household goods are competing in low-cost
          segments of those markets, producing products of a minimally acceptable quality
          for low price.


4	   Firms (especially smaller ones) are also tending to be ‘price takers’ from larger
     firms, because they have little market power. A striking number of firms are stuck
     in subcontracting relationships with scant profit margins available. As examples:

     (a)	 a construction materials contractor noted how “the company has a weak
          negotiation position, especially with large companies, which often dictate unfair



            Research note 1: SMEs characteristics and needs in four poviats of Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie   77
                              contract terms and are trying to shift the risks associated with the implementation
                              of the contract onto the contractee”.

                          (b)	 a producer of packaging materials noted that their clients are predominantly
                               international corporations, ordering massive amounts of goods, but having a very
                               strong purchasing position resulting in a very low profit margin.




                   5	     However, a few firms have successfully differentiated their product and
                          established a ‘niche’ or brand. For example:

                          (a)	 a producer of handmade glass decorations since 1995 has acquired both national
                               and foreign buyers, and sells even in Harrods in London and Fifth Avenue in New
                               York City. They are currently planning a new production plant, and to increase
                               production capacity, while diversifying their offer to sell in less demanding markets
                               where they can increase scale.

                          (b)	 a manufacturer of mirrors has increased its production capacity by approximately
                               25 times within the last 10 years, and they now offer approximately 500 designs.
                               Their competitiveness is boosted by being able to respond quickly to new orders,
                               with flexible production processes and short production series.

                          (c)	 a company constructing and installing roof systems has increased its margin owing
                               to entering production of ventilating flaps and exposures. The firm’s revenues are
                               growing by 5-10 percent each year.




                   6	     Such firms rely on some distinctive skills or product. This insight is actually one
                          of basic economic theory: the more competition a firm has in its market, the lower its
                          profit margin; conversely, if a firm finds a ‘blue ocean’ market (where it is unique or
                          one of only a few suppliers relative to the market) then it can achieve positive margins.
                          As examples in the two regions of focus:

                          (a)	 the glass ornament manufacturer is dependent on their skilled designer—one
                               person—who has generated the products with which they compete successfully.

                          (b)	 the roofing system contractor is dependent on its own design studio, which
                               generates new models and offers the firm a competitive edge.




                   7	     Some firms that had not yet successfully differentiated their product did have
                          investment plans prepared in order to do so. Many of these would allow the
                          company to move into new and more differentiated product lines. Typical investment
                          plans included:

                          (a)	 equipment to allow production of new technological lines;

                          (b)	 equipment to expand production capacity, including for buyers for which scale of
                               production is a necessary condition to enter contracts;

                          (c)	 construction works to expand hotels: building new facilities, rooms, conference
                               center, leisure center.




78   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
 8	      Where companies had not implemented these investment plans, they were
         constrained either by:

             (a)	 Lack of motivation on the part of firm owners to take risks and innovate.
                  Often these owners were aged in their 50s and 60s and were anticipating
                  retirement. Their priority was to ‘get by’ until being able to retire, especially
                  where there was no clear successor in their family or their staff. Hence there
                  may be a demographic (and hence systemic) issue for a lack of innovation in
                  these firms;

             (b)	 Lack of willingness by lenders to finance investment projects (focusing
                  instead on working capital loans). Banks were prone to be relatively
                  conservative in their decisions on long-term investment loans for SMEs. The
                  reasons for this were unclear, but could either be rooted in a deficiency in
                  techniques to assess risk in SMEs, or because of assumptions about the risk in
                  particular industries (e.g. assuming that new products have uncertain markets),
                  or because of some other reason;

             (c)	 Low availability of production sites and land. This problem seemed
                  to afflict Brzozów county because of its hilly areas, and to some extent
                  Sandomierz because of the lack of available land that is not already farmed
                  or in use. New regulations on purchasing agricultural land were passed in
                  mid-2016 have made it more difficult to rezone land from agricultural use to
                  industrial/commercial use. This issue was observed to be more important for
                  small and medium-sized family firms which are unwilling to relocate their
                  production sites to other poviats, because of attachment to their home poviat
                  and because of difficulties in retaining their employees after a move.




 9	      Other firms had not prepared plans and did not know what to do to improve
         margins.




10
 10	 The  preceding observations allow us to present a typology of three main types of
     firms in the lagging regions:

             A.	 Rising champion. These are firms that have successfully developed a
                 differentiated product, and hence are able to generate a profit margin.

             B.	 Constrained potential. These firms have become stuck in a price-taking rut
                 of undifferentiated goods and/or a very competitive market, where they are
                 often subcontractors. However they have recognized their problem, and in
                 some cases even prepared an investment plan to fund product development
                 and differentiation.

             C.	 Declining dipper. These firms are stuck in a similar rut, but have not managed
                 to identify a way out.

 It should be noted that all of these firms are active in industries where it is potentially possible
 to develop a product and increase growth, since they are in tradable goods and services, with
 access to a large and open European market.

Annex 1: SMEs Interview Guide
Introductions and guidelines:
Interview should be conducted with the CEO/owner or another representative of company
management. As a rule the interview/s should not be recorded to increase the openness of
the respondents. Interview can be conducted jointly with 2-3 persons from one company

The main goal of the interview is to discuss the main barriers in development of the company
and to what extent the business support institutions can assist in its development and in
which areas.

Starting the interview:

     1	   Present the idea of the lagging regions project.
     2	 Present the institutions implementing the project – the World Bank, the European
        Commission and the Ministry of Economic Development.
     3	 Inform the interviewees that their responses to this questionnaire will inform our work
        to improve the services provided by business support institutions—and that we seek
        their open and comprehensive guidance to do this well.
     4	 Confirm, that the data and opinions collected during the interview will be used solely
        in relation to the implementation of the project and any of the collected opinions and
        statements will not be ever presented in connection with the given institution. Also,
        no data on the individual companies would be presented and analysed.

                  Production structure
                  This section particularly applies to businesses with manufacturing processes, but it is also
                  relevant for agricultural producers. The focus here is to understand production structures and
                  the use of capital and labor, but this is also the key discussion around costs, margins, and
                  productivity. Key issues to cover include:
                  •	   Structure of production and main technologies used
                  •	   Potential areas of constraint to discuss:
                  	         • Difficulties in fulfilling quality/ standards (national and global).
                  	         • Nature of business – size, competitiveness.
                  	         • Labor: skills, availability, cost.
                  	         • Investment and working capital finance.
                  	         • Business regulatory environment issues.
                  •	   What are the constraints impacting productivity (skills, energy, etc.)? How can these be
                       addressed?



                  OPTIONAL – AND PROBABLY FOR MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZE BUSINESSES ONLY:

                  Supply Chain
                  This section focuses on understanding the sources of supply and in particular the current level
                  and nature of purchases in the local supply chain, and the main constraints to expanding local
                  sourcing. Key issues to cover include:
                  •	   Source of supply of key inputs and services.
                  •	   Main barriers to sourcing more from local suppliers, particularly small scale / microenterprises
                       (e.g. scale, quality, standards, reliability, etc).
                  •	   Efforts to support suppliers through technical assistance / examples of success.
                  •	   What more can be done to support integration of small, local suppliers into the value chain?

                  Skills and workforce development
                  This section is crucial to understand the current skill set of the different businesses in the local
                  value system. Only then will next methodological steps be able to bridge the gap between
                  the professional skills needed by the business fabric and training providers in the local labor
                  market. Key issues to cover include:
                  •	   Current workforce
                  	    •	   Recruiting: What types of workers do they recruit? From where? What are the 		
                       	    constraints to finding staff?
                  	    •	   Skills: current and future needs in terms of specific occupations and skills.

                    	   technical schools?

                  Access to finance

                  4.	 Do you use external financing to finance your activity – bank or non-bank loans, leasing,
                      other sources or instruments facilitating access to finance - guarantees?

                  5.	 Do you experience any barriers in access to finance?

6.	 Is the offer of financial institutions adequate to the needs of your company? Which
    products or their parameters are not adequate to the needs of your company? Which
    actions should be taken to facilitate access to finance?

Business environment (local / global) and industry collaboration
This section aims to identify the main determines of competitiveness and assess the perception
on current / future competitiveness and the main constraints to be overcome. It also discusses
the structure of current collaboration in the industry and dialogue both intra-industry and

Introduction
This report constitutes the second of the following two milestones in Activity 2 of the Trust Fund named above,
due at end-September 2016:

   1.	 Short analysis of SMEs’ characteristics in the selected areas based on available quantitative data as well
       as gathered qualitative information. This activity will have as a distinct output a short report prepared by
       the Bank on the characteristics and needs of SMEs in the two selected poviats. (Research note 1)

   2.	 Analysis of the qualitative information gathered from a sample of SMEs in the region on entrepreneurial
       readiness and identification of measures to increase access to services to activate/enhance
       entrepreneurship in SMEs. In addition, the issue of accessing EU funds by SMEs in the regions will be
       analyzed. This activity will have as a distinct output a short report prepared by the Bank identifying key
       barriers to entrepreneurial activity and with recommendations for enhancing entrepreneurial activity in
       the region and for making the access to EU funds easier for SMEs. (Research note 2)

                                                                       - Roles and    Background
                                                                                   Responsibilities
One of the main benefits of qualitative interviews is that it permits a rich understanding
of a firm’s predicament, strategic priorities, and its decision-making process. As
noted in Research note 1, the interviews covered topics such as the strategic direction of the
company, the company’s evolution over time, its main strategic and operational concerns, and
its needs and desires for support services.

As such, we were able to assess the declared demand of SMEs for enterprise
support services, and also to note the inferred demand, according to the interviewers’
observations on the key constraints facing the firm. Both these sets of demands were
noted at the end of each interview. A summary of these declared and inferred demands is
presented in Table 1 below.

  Research note 2: Barriers to entrepreneurial activity and recommendations in four poviats of Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie     87
                          Several insights can be noted from the summary data in the Table:

                               •	   Highly ranked services are often strategic services (rather than operational
                                    services), which can help the firm change the way it does business, develop new
                                    products, and reach new markets.

                               •	   Mid-ranked services are those often given by enterprise support programs
                                    (e.g. business planning, specialized training, support in accessing finance), but it is
                                    notable that these may not be top priorities overall.

                               •	   Very few firms ranked ‘managerial training’ as a priority, but this need was
                                    inferred by interviewers after talking in depth to the firm’s manager about strategic
                                    decision-making in the firm; division of labor in managing daily operations; and
                                    motivation levels amongst workers.



                          We were alert to the extent to which needs differed between Medium, Small, and
                          Micro firms1. While a sample size of 40 is rather small to draw statistical conclusions (and
                          firms were not selected on a random basis), we observed the following patterns:

                               •	   Medium. By definition, medium-size firms had general achieved considerable success
                                    already, having grown to the point where they employed over 50 employees. Their
                                    challenges arose from needing to identify how to expand the business further and
                                    enter new markets, or how to sustain their competitiveness edge given increased
                                    competition from other companies. They were more likely accustomed to using
                                    specialized consultancy services already, but faced a residual issue in finding it difficult
                                    to identify quality consultants and service providers.

                               •	   Small & Micro: Both these categories exhibited the three types of firms typologized
                                    on the previous page: Rising Champion; Constrained Potential; and Declining Dipper.
                                    No systematic differences were observed between the needs of Micro and Small
                                    firms, especially since the categories are rather blurred, with a firm of 9 employees
                                    counted as Micro and a firm of only one more employee counted as Small.

                          What would the most highly-ranked services look like in practice? On the basis of
                          interviews with the companies, example services are presented in Table 2. We have retained
                          a distinction between the sub-categories of services recognized readily by the SME versus
                          services inferred by the interviewer at the end of the interview.

    We use the conventional European definition here of size categories: Micro is up to 10 employees; Small is up to 50; and Medium is up to 250.

Research note 2: Barriers to entrepreneurial activity and recommendations in four poviats of Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie                    89
                  It should meanwhile be noted a few ‘usual suspects’ for enterprise support were
                  not noted by firms particularly often—or were specifically noted not to be problems. In
                  particular:

                      •	   Access to labour. Overall, human capital of workers is not usually a binding
                           constraint on firm-level growth in the poviats. In most firms in these two regions,
                           required labor skills are still relatively basic and easy to learn. Most firms noted a need
                           for low-skill labor rather than trained, skilled labor—and as such did not face technical
                           labor scarcity. Hence new employees can be found and trained.

                           The main labor constraint noted by firms was a lack of workers that were
                           motivated to work hard. Some firms noted a relatively high rate of labor turnover, as
                           they discontinued contracts with workers who were not sufficiently committed and
                           productive. Some firms reported that the better workers tend to go abroad in search
                           of higher salaries, and the remaining workers seem to favor seasonal employment. In
                           general, we would suggest this situation can often result from a deficiency in managerial
                           skills, rather than an innate retardation of workers in these two regions of Poland.

                           However, this is likely to change when firms begin to specialize, innovate,
                           develop new products, or otherwise evolve to require specialized labor
                           skills. For example, some firms reported that “graduates of the vocational
                           schools are not very well prepared to work, also because in schools they use
                           only very simple and not very modern machines. The preparation of the new
                           employee takes even 1-2 years.” A hotel noted that the local vocational school for
                           hospitality does not produce graduates with sufficient skills to function well in
                           a modern and competitive hotel. And two or three firms noted that they found
                           it very hard to find skilled personnel in sales and marketing who can help firms
                           respond to more demanding customers and innovate towards market demand.


                      •	   Training. While some firms have taken and benefited from training programs (for
                           example, an IT software company that took Microsoft training in Kielce financed by the
                           European Social Fund), the same firms noted that training needs may sometimes be
                           too specialized to be provided ‘in region’, and thus vouchers could be more suitable—
                           to be used for specialized trainings in larger cities at specialized institutions, rather than
                           trying to build the capacity of BSIs in the regions. For example:

                               •	   in the household sewage plant industry, the best innovation knowledge
                                    resides at the University of Poznań;

                               •	   for the apparel manufacturer, there are no local vocational schools which
                                    prepare employees sufficiently for the apparel industry.

                           This topic is explored in greater depth under Activity 1, so we will not investigate
                           further here.

                      •	   Access to finance. Many firms declared that they had built up trusted relationships
                           with local banks and faced few if any problems securing credit for working capital. For
                           investment loans, opinions differed, with some firms having managed to obtain credit,
                           and others finding that banks were rather risk-averse for their projects. A number of
                           firms said they were not seeking credit at all, since on principle they wished to run
                           their business entirely with their own financing. Thus in the table of services above,
                           we focus on (i) helping firms identify sources of financing which may be most suitable
                           for their needs; and (ii) helping firms appraise such options. It seems plausible that
                           firms would be more willing to invest if they receive fuller information on the options
                           available and are able to assess the risks involved.
90   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
We also asked firms to note which services they would most be willing to pay for. The
results are shown in Table 3. Two key observations can be made:

   •	    Firms often caveated their declared willingness to pay with the condition “as long as
         it is of good quality. Sometimes it turns out we already know more than the ‘expert’”.
         So quality is a key concern.

   •	    There is a broad correlation between declared need and willingness to pay, but with
         some exceptions—e.g. 13 companies identified a need for collaborative services, but
         only 2 were willing to pay for them (fearing the likelihood of free-riding by other firms);
         23 companies in total would prioritize better knowledge on technology trends and
         industry trends relevant to their production, but only seven of those would pay for it.
         Both of these may suggest a role for publicly-provided services, rather than fee-based
         consultancies.

                  Finally, a special need was observed amongst construction firms: for a revision of the
                  current public procurement regime. This is rather outside the scope of this project, but
                  given that the poviats of interest have a substantial construction sector, and that so many
                  construction firms mentioned it, it is worth noting. The main point made by firms is that
                  the public procurement regime, even after some recent changes, has one dominant criterion
                  for selecting contractees: price. Formally, price accounts for approximately 60 percent of a
                  procurement decision, and other criteria account for 40 percent—particularly two criteria of a
                  guarantee on contract performance, and a guarantee of quality for up to 8 years. But according
                  to construction companies, those other criteria are fulfilled by virtually all companies (since they
                  know they will definitely lose the tender if they do not fulfil them)—hence in practice there
                  is only one real dimension for competition: price. That results a in lower quality of projects,
                  since the focus of companies on cost efficiency above all other considerations (innovation,
                  product improvement, sustainable quality, etc). Further, in some firms’ experiences, even bids
                  with clearly unrealistic prices (e.g. 50 percent of estimated costs) have been accepted. This
                  substantial obstacle to firms in the construction industry is thus worth noting, since it may be
                  incentivizing cost efficiency, but it will not be contributing to a competitive industry in other
                  dimensions, especially in innovation over time.

Initial observations
on EU funds

                  Proposals for services and delivery mechanisms are the topic of the next report, rather than this
                  one. However, the team was asked to note at this intermediate stage any insights obtained
                  from the interviews about ease of access by enterprises to EU funds.

                      (i)	     Overall, several firms interviewed had benefited from EU funds and were
                               happy with the results. For example:

                               a.	 A specialized food processor had achieved a substantial expansion and
                                   modernization of its machinery thanks to EU grants from the 2007-2013
                                   programming period. This had contributed to their successful growth and
                                   increase in employment;

                               b.	 A manufacturer in the metal industry received EU grant funding between
                                   1998 to 2006 to increase its production capacity and upgrade its equipment.
                                   These contributed to the rapid development of the company, and triggered
                                   an upgrading in products towards more innovative solutions, including one
                                   patented product;

                               c.	 A package producer received a EU successfully utilized to implement
                                   computer-based management system automating some business processes
                                   concerning cooperation with suppliers and business clients;

                               d.	 A furniture producer was benefitting from several EU grants under pre-
                                   accession programmes (Phare) as well as from the Structural Funds and
                                   manage to upgrade substantially machines used in furniture production;

                               e.	 A company providing laser cutting services managed to finance purchase of
                                   specialist laser cutting equipment, which enables cutting big sizes of metal
                                   sheets. Possession of such equipment is a substantial competitive advantage
                                   for this company on both local and regional market.

                               f.	   A food producer had taken part in many EU funded programmes aimed at
                                     promoting export activities, which contributed to its substantial increase of
                                     exports (now accounting for 50 percent of its total sales).

                      (ii)	    Several firms also voiced their perception that accessing EU funds requires
                               a lot of paperwork, is bureaucratic, and confusing. For example:

                               a.	 One firm recounted its negative experience concerning delivery of a grant for
                                   improvement of workplace safety. The grant application was made in 2015,
                                   but transfer of money is expected only in early 2017.

                               b.	 One firm noted that training subsidies required so much paperwork that they
                                   decided to opt for commercially-provided training programs instead.

                      (iii)	   More fundamentally, several firms noted that they either decided not to
                               apply for EU funds—or their applications were not successful—because
                               such funds under the 2014-2020 OP are specifically oriented towards
                               innovation. For example:

                               a.	 One firm underlined that it considered applying for support under current
                                   regional operational program, but finally did not find a sound justification
                                   for “innovativeness” element, present as an important selection criterion. The
                                   would-be investment concerned purchase of new / modern technological


94   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
                 equipment that would raise production efficiency, production quality, and
                 would lower energy consumption.

            b.	 Another manufacturing firm had previously benefited from EU funds in 2007-
                2013, which allowed it to modernize its equipment and become competitive
                in international markets; yet expressed a deep disappointment that the
                requirements for projects in the 2014-2020 round had excluded it from being
                eligible to participate.




   (iv)	    This is paradoxical since—as noted in the prior sections of this document—
            companies in the two regions show a critical need to innovate their
            products, processes and businesses. As discussed above, we noticed a distinct
            need for firms to differentiate their products in order to be able to increase
            profitability and growth.



   (v)	     We may reconcile this paradox by observing that innovation in firms in the
            four poviats under study is most likely to be ‘pragmatic innovation’, rather
            than sophisticated innovation by dealing with R&D units of universities. By
            ‘pragmatic innovation’, we mean product and process development that is marginal
            rather than dramatic, and is based on existing firm capabilities. Hence it is plausible
            that the criteria for innovation under the 2014-2020 OPs has become rather too
            restrictive for firms in catching-up regions and poviats to be able to use it.




Next steps
As envisaged in the Terms of Reference, the team will now be engaged in developing and implementing a
system to stimulate uptake of services in SMEs, and identifying ways for SMEs to more easily access relevant EU
funds. This activity will have as a distinct output a report prepared by the Bank with proposals for how SMEs could
better take advantage of services offered by public institutions in the selected poviats and recommendations
regarding adjusting services provided to SMEs by the BSIs in the region.

                      •	   Foundation of Regional Development

                      •	   Staropolska Chamber of Commerce




                  Evolution of BSIs over time
                  Majority of interviewed BSI were established in the first half of nineties, what was a
                  consequence of political and economic transformation, economic crisis and the need for
                  supporting local economies. Initiatives for establishing these institutions came from different
                  groups or institutions:

                      ·	   local entrepreneurs
                      ·	   local self-government,
                      ·	   senator and US consulting firm,
                      ·	   regional self-government (at the beginning of the next decade).

                  New institutions operated mostly as non-governmental organisations (associations or
                  foundations). At this initial phase they were supported mostly by US funds (US Aid) as well as
                  European Funds (e.g. Program of Local Initiatives financed by PHARE). First programs were
                  addressed mostly to unemployed, start-ups and small local enterprises. Some of them receive
                  capital support and established loan or guarantee funds, easing local enterprises access to capital.

                  The first decade of the new century brought growing access to funds for such institutions,
                  mostly from EU funds, but also others (e.g. US AID). These institutions became very effective
                  beneficiaries of these funds, implementing numerous projects financing actions targeted
                  toward unemployed, start-ups, local initiatives, enterprises, improving access to finance (in
                  the form of loan or guarantee funds). Most of them became also a part of national networks
                  of business support institutions, such as:

                      ·	   National System of Services (KSU) for small and medium enterprises, offering
                           information, basic advise services and more advanced,
                      ·	   National Association of Loan/Guarantee Funds
                      ·	   Network of regional centres of European Social Fund (providing information and
                           advice on application for ESF funds).

                  The institutions were particularly active in the period 2007-2015, when plenty of resources
                  were available both from ERDF and ESF. At this time new, representative offices were build,
                  new branches in other cities were established etc. For example the Konskie Assotiation of
                  Supporting Enterpreunership in the peak period implemented 19 projects. Currently, due to
                  the gap between the previous and the current financial perspective the level activity of all
98   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
institutions is much lower, limited to existing sources of financing and economic activity.
Some of interviewed institutions developed significantly through these years from very small,
local organisation to important players at regional and even national level (e.g. Konskie Association
for Supporting Entrepreneurship changed its name to National Association for Supporting
Entrepreneurship). Some of them as an indicator of growth present information on the size of
their office. One institution present on its web page proudly information on the growth from the
small office of 100 m2 to new, representative building with the space of 1200 m2.

Another institution decided to act mostly locally, but adapted interesting business model,
building fancy hotel, generating additional funds for its activities.

Any of interviewed organisation does not publish on its web site reports on its activities,
neither monitoring nor evaluation. The website does not also provide any information on
number of enterprises supported, results of support such as number of job places created,
improved economic situation etc.

IT should be underlined, that institutions playing the role of BSI often simultaneously play
also other functions, e.g. training centres, providing activation services to unemployed,
supporting social enterprises etc. In fact these functions are often implemented by the same
staff members, therefore different spheres of activities




Financing

The most important source of financing of BSI are European funds. Therefore the scope of
activities and model of financing is strongly influenced by the scope and rules of European
Funds. On the other hand BSI try to recognise and understand needs of enterprises and plan
services accordingly, in order to avoid problems at the stage of recruitment (which is often
assessed by project providers as the most risky).

Good examples of services with strong influence of the European Funds are trainings. Several
respondents underlined, that due to a plenty of European Funds this market is spoilt, which
means that enterprises do not want to pay full market prices for trainings. And although the
BSI has the wide range of experts available, in practise about 80% of offered training is offered
in the frame of projects financed by European Fund (mostly European Social Fund). 20% of
training is offered on the commercial basis, usually on specific demand of local enterprises
(e.g. wood producer, planning development of services, asked for specific training for its staff).
(However this observation is not confirmed by researches. According to available data, 79%
of employers financed training of their employees using their own resources and only 15% of
enterprises used public finance. More important may be very low demand for investment in
skills, which in świętokrzyskie is one of the lowest in Poland. (BKL, 2015)).

Another type of service, heavily financed by the European Funds (ESF) is support for start-
ups (including mostly grants or loans for start-ups). In practise this service is fully financed
by European Funds (ESF) and there is limited space for commercial services for this group.
However during consultations it was underlined, that in some cases more specialised, specific
for the sector, advise services would be needed.

The main rule of European Funds is reimbursement only actual costs of projects (staff, office,
equipment etc). Any fee for project providers is not eligible (however project providers often
are able to hide fees in the actual costs – but this was not discussed during interviews).

                                                                           Research note 3: Observations on BSIs   99
                  The only type of service in which case the fee is eligible are financial services: loans and
                  guarantees. Two of interviewed BSIs in fact work as operators of such instruments and
                  according to their declaration, this seems to be very popular form of support among small
                  and medium enterprises. BSIs have their own capital, but also received additional capital from
                  European Funds. As operators they receive a fee.

                  Most of BSI supports firms in the investment processes: initial assessment of investment
                  plans, identification of sources of financing and support in preparation of application. This
                  service is usually offered at least partially for free for enterprises (particularly first, initial phase
                  of assessment and identification) and partially commercially (preparation of application form).
                  For the latter part of the service BSIs usually charge the success fee (flat rate or percentage
                  of grant). One of the interviewed BSIs estimated, that 7,5% of their revenue comes from such
                  commercial services.

                  One of BSI indicated as source of revenues simple advise services (taxes, social contributions,
                  marketing, creation of www), however the firms are mostly interested in rather basic services
                  and are ready to pay rather limited prices (according to BSIs 1 thousands PLN is acceptable
                  price for the service). According to the interviewer, in this case about 80% of services is offered
                  commercially and 20% co-finance by public funds.

                  Other sources of finance are fully commercial services, offered to enterprises. The most
                  common are:

                      ·	   Accounting and HR services (one of BSIs offers such services for enterprises which
                           were created with its support),
                      ·	   Storage of documents for firms (one BSI adapted available space for this purpose),
                      ·	   Energetic audits (however BSIs assess, that this market is too competitive and prices
                           offered by their competitors are too low),




                  Current offer for SMEs

                  Information services
                  Most of information services provided by interviewed BSIs can be assessed as basic information.
                  However there are a few groups of clients of such services and particular BSIs have their own
                  specialisation.

                  One group are persons planning start their own business. Mostly they are interested in
                  availability of grants or at least preferential loans for start-ups. If they are not eligible (see
                  services for start-ups) they are interested in basic information on rules of setting-up a business
                  (taxes, legal issues, marketing etc.).

                  Existing enterprises are much less interesting in information services and demand is practically
                  restricted to information on existing sources of finance. Demand for such services occurs
                  when a firm has a liquidity problems or development plans. Demand for more advance
                  information services, such as market or product analysis -- industry trends; market intelligence
                  and attractiveness; industry cost structure was not identified. This is not clear whether such
                  services are not provided because BSIs have limited capacity to offer them, or there is lack
                  of demand for such services (at least conscious demand). It can also be a case, that more
                  advanced firms (medium) searching more “professional” services providers and are ready to
                  pay for such services on the market.

Advice services
This type of service is often closely linked to information services. As it was mentioned in the
previous chapter, often information services (on sources of financing) is continuing as advise
service, focused on preparation of grants.

There is a common observation, that demand for advice services is rather limited. Firms are
not expressing the need for such services, which may be linked with common belief that
firms owners have high skills in firms management as well as with image of BSI rather as a
distributor / facilitator in access to the European Fund then the source of expertise.

One BIS opened in 2012 a special unit specialising in advice services, however now this is
assessed rather as failure due to limited demand.

Demand for advice services is linked with two common situation:

    ·	   Difficult situation of company (problems with liquidity) – in such cases firms are
         looking for additional sources of financing and often are offering additional services,
         aiming at improving condition of firm)
    ·	   FDevelopment plans – in such cases firms are looking form financing opportunities
         and advise services related to specific investment.

On the basis of interviews a hypothesis can be formulated, that BSIs located in smaller cities
are more often offering basic advice services, while BSIs located in Kielce are prepared to offer
more advanced services. Examples of such services were identified:

    ·	   Optimisation of management and production process (on of BSI specialises in such
         service, however usually it requires a lot of preparation effort to convince the firm for
         such service)
    ·	   Support in entering new markets and internalisation of the firm.

If such more specialised services are successful, the firm often is willing to use services of BSI
in following years.

Trainings
Some of interviewed BSI develop offer of trainings, mostly financed by ESF and recently
national source (National Training Fund – KFS).

Trainings are offered to persons starting their own business (foundation of running a business).

In case of employees of firms the most popular trainings are vocational, finished with officially
acknowledged certificate allowing conduct specific occupation (e.g. transport of danger
substances, computer driving licence). Training are usually short (about 100 hours) and
relatively chip, therefore their quality can be also rather low.

One example of more advance and longer training was identified: a postgraduate study on
management for entrepreneurs and managers. The course was offered for 25 persons from
4 poviats, a year-long and implemented in close cooperation with the Denmark School of
Management. The quality of the course was very high, however the cost of the training was
covered by project (finance by Swiss Funds). The BSI considered continuation of the training
in future on the commercial basis.




                                                                         Research note 3: Observations on BSIs   101
                   Support for start-ups.
                   One common service, particularly offered by BSI in smaller cities, is support for start-ups,
                   consisting of three types of services:

                      ·	   Training on entrepreneurship,
                      ·	   Advice,
                      ·	   Grants.

                   This package of services is usually financed by ESF rather as part of active labour market policy
                   then support for entrepreneurship. Therefore the services are usually targeted to specific target
                   groups, in more difficult situation on the labour market, such as youth, older, unemployed,
                   living in rural areas etc.

                   The scope of services is usually highly standardised and some interviewers underlined the
                   need for more specialised services, particularly in more regulated fields of business (e.g.
                   health services). Due to limited amount of grants, most of start-ups are created in low-cost
                   services (e.g. hairdresser, trade, mechanics). On the other hand the available studies show, that
                   survivability of these firms is higher then average on the market.

                   Financial support
                   Financial support for firms is offered in two forms:

                      ·	   Grants – distributed directly by the Marshal Office (in this case BSIs can play supportive
                           role, helping preparing applications for grants)
                      ·	   Loans and guarantees – distributed by BSI experienced in such services (usually
                           managing their own loans or guarantee funds).

                   This type of service is assessed as very successful in terms of the pace of distribution of
                   funds. One of the interviewed BSI managed to distribute in relatively short period of time 20
                   million PLN of loans to firms.

                   Lobbing / representation
                   Some BSIs are also an important actor at the regional or even national level, participating
                   in many committees, working groups, meetings etc., representing interests of firms and
                   BSIs (however the distinction between these two functions is not always clear), influencing
                   regional and national policies supporting enterprises.

                   However the challenge is low capacity of some BSIs, particularly currently in the gap between
                   two financial perspective and lack of financial sources. For some of them fulfilling these
                   functions is very time consuming and without public support (in form of grants or financing
                   services) this is difficult to manage. One example are consortia for smart specialisations on the
                   request of the Marshal Office. The regional authorities are expecting that consortia will play
                   an active role in integration of enterprises in the specific sector, but members of consortia are
                   not able to play such a role without financial support.

                   Development and assessment of services
                   Most of interviewed BSIs do not conduct any formal process of needs assessment. Usually it is
                   based on informal consultation with firms, ideas of BSIs management and staff. Some of BSIs
                   are present relatively long on the market and therefore they express strong conviction that
                   they have good understanding of needs of firms.




102   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
Only one BSI collects and analyse information from clients on their needs (as part of evaluation
form). This institution also developed a formalised note on contact with clients, containing
the most important information on client’s situation and its needs in terms of services.
Development of such procedures may be a result of more advance approach to quality of
services and implementation of appropriate ISO norms.

The relevance of assessments of needs of enterprises may heavily depend on the skills and
capacity of BSIs consultants and time spend on analyses of firm’s situation and needs. The first
and directly expressed needs of firms are often very basic and intuitive, but not always correct.
In some cases the staff of BSIs is more experienced in managing EU projects then understanding
business, managing and production processes and identification of potential gaps or needs.

This may be caused by low level of trust of firms to BSIs (firms do not willing to uncover their
internal processes, problems and challenges, treating BSI’s consultants as competitors).
Most of interviewed BSIs do not also conduct evaluation of clients satisfaction. In fact one
such institution was identified, which conduct surveys, produce on that basis reports and
introduce changes in their offer. However the BSI do not publish these reports and did not
agree to give the example of report to consultant. This shows clearly that there is a lack of
transparency and sufficient supervision of public funds (there is no obligation to conduct and
publish reports on clients satisfaction).

Any of interviewed BSIs do not conduct a rigorous evaluation of results of their support and its
impact on firms conditions. Such evaluation is also not conducted by the regional authorities.




Perceptions of SMEs

The BSI’s perception of SMEs seems to be rather negative. During interviews it was many times
mentioned that SMEs are not aware their needs, not interesting in buying support services
and representing low level of trust. Such opinions were formulated mostly in the case of micro
and small enterprises. Medium enterprises are assessed as more aware of their development
needs and ready to invest in supporting services, however some of them have internal units
able to provide some of services (e.g. training) and some of them are buying such services in
bigger cities, like Warsaw or Cracow, from national consulting firms.

BSIs acknowledged also needs for supporting collective services, particularly to firms operating
in smart specialisation, e.g. metal-cast sector. However interviewers underlined huge
diversification of potential of firms in this sector, from very small, family owned, traditional firms
offering rather simple and not competitive products to bigger, very innovative companies,
cooperating with the biggest firm in the Europe, offering highly specialised and high quality
products. Therefore needs of such diversified sector varies significantly.

Evolution of BSIs over time

The BSIs in podkarpackie region we evolving over time. The majority of key BSIs were established
long time ago: Regional Development Agency (RDA) IN-MARR in Mielec in 1991, Rzeszów
RDA and the Regional Chamber of Commerce in Sanok in 1993, Bieszczadzka RDA in 1994. At
the moment of their creation they were usually projected as local / regional organizations put
in place to support general local development, including implementing of various measures
to support entrepreneurship and (mostly) micro and small firms. Then, throughout last 20
years, there were implemented many (mostly EU funded) programs supporting BSIs, both
in podkarpackie and other Polish regions, allowing for steady development of all this kind of
organizations. The programs were mostly aimed at:

    •	   Stimulating international cooperation, especially with neighbouring countries (in case
         of podkarpackie: Ukraine and Slovakia);

    •	   Training BSI staff to enable them to provide the SMEs sphere with general as well as
         specialized consulting services;

    •	   Development of financial instruments (microloan funds and loan guarantee funds),
         in order to limit finance access barriers typically encountered by the lower end of the
         SME sector, especially within underdeveloped territories;

    •	   Assistance in implementation within the region of various national development
         programmes (the BSIs to take care for local / regional promotion of such programs, in
         some cases the BSIs were also playing the role of the representative of the national
         agency in the region and in this respect being responsible of some kind of “middleman
         services” respective to the programs / projects’ scopes, for instance: collecting funding
         applications, executing formal evaluation; sometimes the BSIs were also engaged
         in supporting the programs’ implementation phase: offering day-to-day hands-
         on administrative assistance to the programs’ beneficiaries, monitoring of projects’
         implementation and timelines, controlling projects’ expenditures, undertaking
         evaluation of applications to amend the grant contracts etc.).

    •	   Stimulation of training for SMEs employees / owners – provision of specialised training
         and offering / servicing training grants.

In general most of the BSIs, both in Poland and in the region, have not been concentrated on
any specific branches of economy (therefore dominate general scopes of activity), however
with few exceptions - for example the Chamber of Commerce in Stalowa Wola has been
developing so-called welding cluster, the Aviation Valley Association (not interviewed BSI,
because in Brzozów and Leżajsk poviats aviation industry is almost non-existent) concentrated
its activity on aviation industry (building it on the basis of the fact that in podkarpackie region
there are placed many aviation companies, mostly in within the area of Rzeszów and Mielec)
and the RDA in Tarnobrzeg being a co-organizer of a cluster uniting automotive industry firms
from South-Eastern Poland. In general such BSIs were relatively the most successful ones,
since they had close links with the SMEs and other enterprises.


                                                                         Research note 3: Observations on BSIs   107
                       Most of the BSIs took part in various national networks. The most important one (so called
                       National Service Network) was managed by the national governmental agency - the Polish
                       Agency of Enterprise Development1. Participation in this network brought many positive
                       results in terms of BSIs human and organizational development - the PAED sponsored many
                       projects, including training and human development, allowing the participating BSIs to gather
                       many, earlier not present, skills and competencies. At the moment, however, the network is
                       not operating and most probably - sooner or later - it will probably stop its activity.

                       There were also (however not many) projects stimulating BSIs to develop fully commercial
                       activities. There were several attempts, but in general not very successful, mostly implemented
                       in 2010-2013 period. This happened because of increasing pressure from the European
                       Commission to commercialise BSIs services. This tries included testing of some SMEs directed
                       services, assumed as adequate for future commercialization2. This however, so far, have not
                       been converted into practice. The service marketing component was somehow put aside.

                       The most successful period for the Polish BSIs took place within the years 2006-2011 when
                       there were many support programs available, especially funded from the European Social
                       Fund resources. On the other hand, however, some of these projects, probably quite many,
                       were not very efficient and their results were not worth money spent (at least at the moment
                       such assessment opinions completely prevail). For that, since 2011-2012 access to money for
                       BSIs became much more difficult and after completion of projects financed within 2007-2013
                       financial perspective, situation of many institutions both in the region and nationwide have
                       become quite difficult, resulting in reducing of employment and limiting typical range of
                       activities. Those BSIs which had stable sources of income (even limited) such as rents from the
                       incubator or technology park tenants or interest rate from the loans issued were in a much
                       better situation than all the others, which sources of income were mostly generated from the
                       projects’ related activity.




                       Financing

                       Most of the BSIs depend strongly on the EU funded projects and if the amount of funding
                       available still decreases they might experience further substantial problems. The key source of
                       funding for many BSIs was the reimbursement of costs within implemented grant projects.
                       In such cases the BSI (usually after taking part in a competitive procedure) within the given
                       project was obliged to organise certain number of training events, study visits, audits on site
                       etc. and for that it was eligible to receive reimbursement of the agreed amount of expenditures
                       incurred (salaries, office rent, transportation costs etc.). Usually the scope of services was
                       decided by the Contracting Authority, so the BSI was looked upon rather as a typical project
                       managing unit, responsible for implementing it and for settling financial accounts.

                       Many BSIs were also providing training services for SMEs. In most cases these training events
                       were substantially (or totally) financed by the EU funds and share of private funding was
                       usually very limited.

108   i Activity 2 - Activating Entrepreneurship in Deprived Areas
Very many BSIs were also engaged (on a fully commercial basis) in preparation of applications
for EU funds for the other institutions (local government entities, NGOs and enterprises).
Some of BSIs were excluded from this, because the played important role in implementation
system of the EU funds (e.g. RDAs in Rzeszów and Mielec, depending on the period). In this
area, however, there was also strong competition from the fully private consulting companies
sector (in some cases established by the former BSIs employees).

In some areas local or regional authorities decided to entrust the BSIs management of
business incubators or technology parks. In some cases the BSIs were also playing the role
of real estate developers. In this respect they were responsible for supervision of building
of the buildings and preparation of the necessary utility infrastructure (water, electricity, gas
etc.) - they played a temporary role of general construction-site supervising body.Some BSIs
benefitted also from income of rented offices and production space as well as other services
for the firms located in a given building or on a given area.

For some BSIs also one of sources of income were fees and interest rate from operating
of financial instruments such as loan and loan guarantee funds and (if they were still
implementing projects to establish such instruments) reimbursement of costs of managing
of these instruments. In general the income from such source of activity, especially after
completing the respective projects and stopping covering management fees, was not that
high. It applies especially to the guarantee funds, which charge only very limited guarantee
fees (because of competing EU and national schemes). In case of loan funds the situation was
more complicated, but again many BSIs were implementing the easiest strategy, limiting fees
charged and also charging very low interest rate.

In general in podkarpackie region the sector of loan funds is quite developed: 3 the largest (in
terms of capitalisation) loan funds were run by: Mielec Regional Development Agency (loan
capital amounting to 52,2 mln PLN, 350 loans granted in 2015 for the total value of 22,7 mln
PLN), Regional Chamber of Commerce in Stalowa Wola (loan capital of 31,1 mln PLN, 81 loans
granted in 2015 for the total value of 8,8 mln PLN and the Leżajsk Development Association
(fund’s capital amounting to 17,5 mln PLN, 74 loans granted in 2015 for the total value of 7,7
mln PLN)1. The guarantee funds were much less active (as is the also the case of most of
other Polish regions). There are only 2 guarantee funds in the region of which the bigger one,
Podkarpacki Regional Guarantee Fund operates the amount of 20,4 mln PLN of guarantee
capital and in 2015 issued 61 guarantees for the total value of 14 mln PLN2.

  This line of activity used to be one of the most important in case of most of the BSIs participating in the National System of Services organized
/ managed by Polish Agency of Enterprise Development. For many ears such services (“Legal and administrative issues of economic activity”)
were co-financed by the Agency. In fact, this allowed to set-up quite high competencies of BSIs as regards servicing needs concerning
individual economic activity development. In case of the BSIs that manage financial instruments (maintain loan funds / lending activity), this
became also a kind of clients (borrowers) supply mechanism - a BSI could offer a full path of business development assistance, starting from
advisory on micro business establishment issues and ending on offering initial debt finance.

Perceptions of SMEs
The vast majority of interviewed representatives of BSIs in Podkarpackie region underline a
big difficulty in implementing advisory services on commercial basis. This conclusion concerns
especially the case of SMEs representing the lower size end of the regional SME sector,
definitely dominating the populationof enterprises in Podkarpackie. The interviewees tend to
underline three the most important barriers, concerning:

    1.	 Lack of financial resources, available for ‘investing’ in receiving consulting assistance,
        especially of a strategic dimension,

    2.	 Lack of knowledge on needs for consulting assistance

    3.	 Limited potential of the most of micro and small size businesses to up-take the
        consulting process and to properly utilize its results.

In case of microenterprises and a quite large fraction of small firms such services are - in
the most cases - unaffordable by the majority of potential recipients. According to BSIs
representatives the ‘financial’ factor ranks as the most important barrier to deliver any services
against fees, even if set-up on a moderate level. Since the positive economic / financial result
of a consulting offer may not be guaranteed (such is the nature of most consulting services),
it is of extreme difficulty to convince a micro / small firm to invest its - by the rule - limited
resources. This in fact means that to market any consulting offer one (the entity offering it)
must invest and implement at least a part of a service for free. And in this way building a room
to continue the service against payments, provided the initial result will be assessed positively.
The representatives of BSIs point out that the BSIs limited resources practically do not allow
to adopt this kind of approach.

According to interviewed BSIs representatives, besides the ‘finance’ capability factor there
are two other reasons strongly limiting readiness to up-take consulting services by small and
micro enterprises in the podkarpackie region.

The first very often underlined factor concerns the lack of knowledge on consulting needs
on the side of the most micro and small enterprises. Being completely engaged in day-to-
day firms’ operation management their owners are not able to recognize areas of required
serviceable assistance, especially of a strategic (long-term) importance. The owners usually
underline their needs concerning assistance in the sphere of book-keeping, pay-rolls and
taxation, that is a very tangible and practical issues in case of each economic entity. In fact,
according to the interviewees, there are examples of assistance projects in which their
business participants were offered initial screening of the firms development needs, then
used to set-up a concrete block of consulting services, that were finally welcomed and - in
many cases - occurred efficient for the firms after implementation. But these were sponsored
actions - in fact offered for free or for a very limited (symbolic fees). Summarizing the issue
here is how a BSI may convince the recipients on usefulness of up-taking external assistance
and in what fields in case of a given enterprise such services may be beneficial. According to
BSIs representatives, this kind of a ‘screening’ will always be extremely difficult to be delivered
on commercial basis, because of its results uncertainty (the screening - being costly - may
however conclude that there is no space for any feasible consulting assistance). This kind
of actions should rather be perceived as a sort of an investment required to be financed
by the service provider. This however is very much dependant on financial and operational
capabilities of BSIs that are in a way put in a position to invest in building the market, and - as
described at the beginning - possess very limited resources to invest.



                                                                         Research note 3: Observations on BSIs   111
                          The next reason importantly limiting interest in acquiring consulting services relates to micro
                          and small firms capability to up-take the consulting service, both, during its delivery period
                          and later on in the business practice of the service beneficiary. In fact, this is an important
                          limitation, very much justified by the size and therefore firms’ capability to in-take the whole
                          consulting process and - later on - even its outcomes. The result ofthis factor is - in (rare)
                          cases of firms that are ready to accept consulting assistance - that the entrepreneur expects
                          external consultant to deliver the service without special engagement of the firms human
                          resources. Of course, in most of consulting cases it is not possible - it undermines efficiency
                          of a consulting process. Therefore, the only way to deliver such assistance is to implement it
                          in a format of a day-to-day co-work of the consultant within the structures of the recipient.
                          According to BSIs’ representatives, such model would be workable, but on the other hand
                          will always be expensive and very much demanding as regards availability of experts working
                          directly in the premises of the service beneficiary.




                          Potential new services and funding models

                          Many BSIs are looking for the new market niches, but at the competitive market it is not so
                          easy to identify such areas. Moreover, some BSIs are still used to the ‘traditional’ model of
                          operation, mostly based on the implementation of the publicly funded projects.

                          The areas in which BSIs can develop their services (with partial public support) is the general
                          and specialised support for start-ups. Many BSIs have long and rich experience in providing
                          services concerning setting-up and initial phase of business development. Some of them
                          also take part in consortia implementing projects within Sub-measure 1.1.1 of the Operational
                          Programme Eastern Poland aimed at support and development of innovative start-ups.

                          Podkarpackie region has also strong links with neighbouring Ukraine. Many Ukrainians work
                          or study in the region. Some of them might need targeted assistance in setting up companies
                          or (for the ones possessing so called Pole card, certifying Polish origin) in starting economic
                          activity as sole trader (individual economic activity of a physical person - dominating in Poland
                          form of conducting micro size businesses).

                          The BSIs closely linked to the specific group of firms, operating in a given industry (some
                          Chambers of Commerce and Aviation Valley) are also providing and developing specific
                          services adjusted to the needs of those companies. This is very promising area of activity,
                          but limited to few BSIs having strong links with concrete branch of industry. In this respect,
                          at least some of them, could be capable of promoting and organizing groups / networks of
                          firms (micro-clusters) preparing common product / service offer based on local / regional
                          unique assets7. The core role of BSIs within such projects could be identification of market
                          potentials, organizing the common products / services delivery and taking care its marketing
                          issues.
