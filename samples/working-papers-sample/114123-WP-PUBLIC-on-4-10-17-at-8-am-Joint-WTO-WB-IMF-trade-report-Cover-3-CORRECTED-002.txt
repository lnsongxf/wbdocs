EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The role of trade in the global economy is at a critical juncture. Increased trade integration helped to
drive economic growth in advanced and developing economies in the latter part of the 20 th century.
Since the early 2000’s, however, a slowdown in the pace of trade reform, a post-crisis uptick in
protectionism, and risk of further reversals have been a drag on trade, productivity, and income
growth. At the same time, trade is leaving too many individuals and communities behind, notably also
in advanced economies. To be sure, job losses in certain sectors or regions in advanced economies have
resulted to a large extent from technological changes rather than from trade. But adjustment to trade
can bring a human and economic downside that is frequently concentrated, sometimes harsh, and has
too often become prolonged. It need not be that way. With the right policies, countries can benefit
from the great opportunities that trade brings and lift up those who have been left behind. Those
polices ease adjustment to trade, as well as strengthen overall economic flexibility and performance.

At their meeting at Hangzhou in September 2016, G20 leaders called for domestic policies to share
the gains from trade more widely. They also called for action to better communicate the benefits of
open trade to a public that may have become more skeptical, especially in advanced economies. This
paper aims to guide the response to these calls. It starts by surveying related long-term economic
trends, discussing the benefits from trade, and examining how trade can lead to difficult adjustments
that pose hardships and draw away from public support for trade. This sets up the discussion in the
latter parts of the paper on how domestic policies can help mitigate the adjustment process and the
role trade policy can play going forward in supporting strong and inclusive global growth.

Trade openness, underpinned by the expansion of the multilateral trading system, has brought about
higher productivity, greater competition, lower prices, and improved living standards. Trade-related
shifts in the allocation of resources across sectors and firms and adoption of new technologies have
generated productivity gains. On the consumption side, open trade has led to wider choices and lower
prices of many goods and services, benefitting especially lower-income households who consume a
disproportionately higher share of tradeable goods and services. Trade is estimated to have reduced by
two-thirds (one quarter) the price of the household consumption basket of a typical advanced economy
low-income (high income) household. Recent research suggests that trade has also helped to advance
certain other social objectives.

Trade has, however, negatively impacted groups of workers and some communities. Recent evidence
on the effect of import competition on manufacturing jobs in certain locations in Europe and the United
States demonstrates how harsh such impacts can be in the absence of accompanying policies.
Dislocations depend not just on the size or abruptness of the trade shock, but on broader
circumstances, such as the health of the economy, labor market rigidities, and other impediments to
resource reallocation, as well as the adequacy of social protection policies. Moreover, policies that help
to sustain strong economic and job growth can ease the costs of adjustments to trade. Understanding
the various factors driving dislocations is critical to designing appropriate domestic policies to address
them.

Domestic policies to address trade-related adjustments are critical. Easing worker mobility across
firms, industries, and regions minimizes adjustment costs and promotes employment. Active labor
market policies play an important role in supporting these initiatives. If well-designed and tailored to
country circumstances, they can facilitate reemployment and augment worker skills; such policies
include job search assistance, training programs, and, in some situations, wage insurance. Important

social safety nets like u nemployment insurance and other “p assive ” labor market policies can provide
workers directly affected by import competition with an opportunity to retool on their own. While they
have had a limited impact thus far, if well targeted and adequately financed trade adjustment
assistance programs could take on a greater role.

Approaches beyond labor market policies are also needed. Education systems need to prepare
workers for the changing demands of the modern labor market, and policies in areas such as housing,
credit, and infrastructure need to facilitate mobility. Measures aimed at reviving hard-hit communities
could also be considered. Dealing with dislocations early and comprehensively is critical since the
impact may otherwise become entrenched in the community, leading to outcomes that are harsher and
longer-lasting. Measures that support competitiveness and productivity growth can also help to ensure
that displaced workers find new opportunities.

Further trade integration is important to reinvigorating global growth and advancing an inclusive
trading environment. Traditional areas such as agriculture need further attention, while sectors such as
services, as well as digital trade, represent areas where further trade reform can make a particularly
strong contribution to growth. And while bilateral and regional agreements can play an important role
in securing more open trade, the innovations from these agreements should eventually be brought to
the global level. Going forward, mitigating trade adjustment costs needs to be a more integral part of
trade reforms to avoid costly social and economic remediation and to ensure wide support for trade.

A strong global trading system centered on the WTO remains critical. Strong, well-enforced trade rules
help to promote competition and to reassure citizens that international trade is evenhanded. The WTO
dispute settlement function has proven to be a powerful tool for enforcing rules regarding tariffs and
other conventional trade measures, but also those regarding subsidies and other “behind -the-border”
measures that potentially distort trade. Sustaining the dispute settlement system, further recognizing
the value of transparency and other key functions, as well as continuing to build on recent successes to
revive the WTO's negotiating function—including through the use of more flexible approaches to attain
multilateral outcomes or through plurilateral agreements, as appropriate —is more important than
ever. Continued efforts in these areas would also discourage all types of protectionism, and further
demonstrate that trade agreements provide a system of rules that is evenhanded to all.

I.       INTRODUCTION
1.      Longstanding tension between the benefits of open commerce and public support for
it has become particularly salient today. “Free trade,” Thomas M acaulay observed in 1824, “one of
the greatest blessings which a government can confer on a people, is in almost every country
unpopular.” Policymakers face this conundrum regularly. At the Hangzhou Summit, G20 leaders
pledged to work harder to build an open world economy and to promote greater inclusiveness.
They called for action to communicate better the benefits of open markets to the wider public and
for domestic policies to distribute those benefits more widely.1

2.      G-20 leaders saw the issue not as a tradeoff between openness and inclusiveness, but
as a challenge to achieve more of both. To understand this framing it is useful to break down
Macaulay’s observation.

    Is open trade beneficial? Section II examines major trends, with a focus on the role of trade, while
     Section III looks at conceptual arguments and real experience. The record of more open markets
     in delivering opportunity and higher living standards is a reminder that trade is a tool for
     increased prosperity, not simply a textbook ideal. Yet building awareness of the benefits has too
     often been left to economists alone, and the paper provides examples of government efforts to
     communicate better the benefits of trade to the public. Turning away from trade has in the past
     created economic malaise, dislocations, and global conflict. Trade itself is not the problem, but
     rather can—with the right supporting policies —be part of the solution.

    Why is trade often “unpopular”? Public opinion surveys show support for trade remains broader
     than is often recognized, despite sometimes taking the blame for unrelated ills. Yet, as Section
     IV explores, recent experience shows that too many individuals and communities, notably also in
     advanced economies (AEs), have been left behind by trade: there are legitimate reasons for
     discontent. At the same time, it can be difficult for individuals to separate the adjustment
     pressures related to trade from those that result from technological change and innovation.

3.     Improved domestic policies and further trade reform can stimulate growth that is
more inclusive. Addressing the source of discontent is important in its own right and also critical to
shoring up support for trade.

    Domestic policies are key. Section V underscores that early action to improve labor mobility
     should take center stage, by reducing the impediments to workers moving across firms,
     industries, and locations. The trade-related dislocations tend to be long-lasting and costly, and
     when they do occur it is important to provide appropriate assistance promptly. While there is no
     one-size-fits-all strategy for mitigating the adjustment costs that can arise from trade, there is
     room for active labor market policies, social protection, and complementary policies in the areas
     of education, housing, and credit. Trade policy itself can also play a supporting role.

 The importance of coherence between domestic and international policies has been emphasized on many
occasions; the discussion in this paper shows that it remains as relevant for developed as for developing economies.

    Further trade reforms are needed to boost global growth and to strengthen rules t hat promote fair
     competition. Tackling the high barriers to trade that remain in some key areas of the global
     economy stands to strengthen productivity growth and spread increased prosperity. Section VI
     examines what can be done, stressing also the WTO’s key role in the global trading system, and
     the need to sustain its dispute settlement, transparency, and other functions.

4.      This paper draws on a wide range of recent policy analysis. Existing studies from
international organizations provide greater depth in a number of areas that goes beyond what is
possible in the present paper (Box). Throughout the paper, references to key pieces of research and
policy analysis from academics, think tanks, and international organizations help to document the
statements made and provide options for readers who wish to delve into certain topics. Lessons are
also drawn from country experience.

The ILO recently examined the role of labor provisions i n international tra de and investment agreements (ILO, 2016). It
found that trade agreements with labor provisions i ncreased labor force participation ra tes, particularly of females.
Moreover, the inclusion of l abor provisions did not i mpact the extent to which trade increased under a new a greement.

been shown in practice to bring greater economic growth and greater employment, so long as it is complemented by
a ppropriate macroeconomic and supporting policies. Rapid i ncreases in i mport competition have been associated with
i ncreased unemployment initially, but over the longer term tra de openness is a ssociated with more and better jobs. This
fol l owed a s tudy of the experience of 16 countries with Economic Reform in this Era of Globalization (G-20, 2003).

II.            LONG-TERM TRENDS
Trade and Growth
5.       The volume of world trade expanded at an unprecedented historical pace in the latter
twentieth century. From 1960 to the eve of the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2007, global trade in
goods and services grew at an average real rate of about 6 percent a year, which was about twice
that of real GDP growth during the same period (Figure 1). This expansion was supported by
important reductions in trade costs—through changes in policy (such as tariffs) and technology
(transport and information). Reductions in trade costs have facilitated the expansion of global value
chains (GVCs), which have become a strong driver of productivity and manufacturing exports since
the early 1990s. In advanced economies (AEs) as well as emerging and developing economies
(EMDEs), the rising living standards that came with greater trade openness lent widespread support
to the view of trade as a key engine of economic growth.

6.      While trade integration has brought greater prosperity, the extent to which it has
powered economic growth has depended on country characteristics and supporting policies.
Differences in the growth benefits of trade openness across countries reflect economic structures—
notably the nature of export specialization and degree of production diversification (Henn and
others, 2015)—and the quality of institutions (Rodrik and others, 2004). Cross-country evidence
nonetheless links greater trade openness to higher per capita income (Frankel and Romer, 1999;
Feyrer, 2009). It also links trade reform (proxied as reductions in tariffs) to higher rates of
productivity and income growth (Figure 2), and declining poverty (see Annex A on Trade and
Poverty)—suggesting that the causality may run mainly from trade reform and trade, to higher
incomes (Section III).

7.       The sharp slowdown in global trade in recent years is both a symptom of and a
contributor to low growth. After a sharp drop during the GFC and a brief rebound in its immediate
aftermath, trade and output growth again slowed, with trade being unusually weak relative to past
performance. Recent analyses attribute the trade slowdown, in varying degrees, to such factors as
changes in the composition of economic activity away from import-intensive investment, a slowing
pace of global value chain growth and trade liberalization, and an uptick in trade protectionism.2
While rates of investment and of economic growth have weighed on trade, recent trade growth has
been some 1 to 2 percentage points a year less than would have been expected based on the
historical relationship between trade and these macroeconomic factors (IMF, 2016a).

8.      Trade integration since the early 1990s has also been associated with important
changes in the country composition of global trade . Merchandise trade among AEs, as a share of
total world trade, fell from about 70 percent in the early 1980s to less than 40 percent by the early
2010s (Figure 3, left panel), as trade involving EMDEs grew rapidly. Rising commodity prices and
other factors discussed below played a role in EMDEs’ rising share of global trade.

9.      These changes have been accompanied by far-reaching shifts in manufacturing across
countries. Increased EMDE manufactures exports have been accompanied by relative declines in the
share of manufacturing to output in many AEs, where service sectors have generally grown more
rapidly (Figure 3, right panel). This development, however, has not been uniform, as manufacturing
sector shares in some AEs have increased. The experience of EMDEs has also varied: manufacturing
output has increased most rapidly in countries with greater involvement in value chains, such as
China, and other Asian and Eastern European EMDEs.

10.     Expanding services trade has been supported by new business models in areas like
financial services and information and communication technology. The growth in services trade
has occurred despite the fact that policy barriers to services trade remain substantial in many areas.
Services comprise some two thirds of global GDP and employment, and a quarter of global trade 3
(nearly half of global trade measured on a value-added basis). According to WTO figures, global
commercial services imports grew at some 5 percent a year during 2010 –15, compared to 1 percent
growth for merchandise trade. Moreover, innovation in digital technology and other services has
helped to reshape the trade landscape and spurred the development of GVCs.


Trade Policy Landscape
11.     The rapid pace of trade opening from the late 1980s to early 2000s has slowed sharply
in recent years, even as trade restrictions in some areas remain high and the stock of new
restrictions put in place since the global financial crisis continues to grow. Tariffs have declined
considerably, but with little recent progress they remain high for some products in some countries.
Moreover, cuts in applied tariff rates have not been locked in by corresponding reductions in WTO

 Services trade is commonly measured on the basis of BoP data. These data do not include all forms of supplying
services, which are nonetheless covered by the measures of barriers to services trade discussed here.

tariff ceilings (“bindings”). Non-tariff measures also remain pervasive with respect to trade in goods.
Services trade restrictions may be particularly damaging, given the sector’s size, its potential
contribution to aggregate productivity growth, and innovations that make trade in many types of
services more feasible. Regional trade agreements have brought down trade costs, increasing in
number and depth and sometimes going beyond the realm of the WTO, but lack the institutional
and legal strengths of the WTO-led system. The share of G20 imports affected by trade-restrictive
measures put in place since the global financial crisis continues to rise gradually, reaching
6.5 percent as of November 2016.

Trade Costs
12.      As far as trade is concerned, the world is not “flat.” The costs of trading goods are
estimated to range from 50 to 400 percent on a bilateral basis.4 They reflect factors as diverse as
distance, investment climates, language, logistics, and transport, as well as trade policies. Certain
factors such as distance are beyond the reach of policy, but others such as air connectivity and
shipping are not (Arvis and others, 2013). Trade policy, regional partnerships, regulatory policies,
and the investment climate are mostly under the direct influence of policymakers. Overall the costs
of trading goods tend to be higher for EMDEs (often double those of AEs) and for agricultural
goods. Over the last twenty years, most countries showed a modest reduction in these costs, with
more rapid reductions by certain fast-growing EMDEs. The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA),
which entered into effect in February 2017, is expected to contribute greatly to further reductions in
some types of trade costs.

13.      As with trade in goods, the costs of trading services reflect both exogenous factors
and policy. Factors such as the extent of digitization of a service may be only partially influenced by
policy, but policies that inhibit investment flows and the establishment of service suppliers, the
cross-border delivery of services, or the free movement of professionals bear importantly on services
trade costs. Services trade restrictions protect domestic services suppliers from competition,
allowing incumbents to charge inflated prices that harm consumers and make it more difficult for
downstream users (e.g., other service industries, farmers, and manufacturers) who need the services
concerned to compete internationally.

Tariffs and Non-Tariff Measures
14.     Tariffs were steadily reduced from the 1980s to the early 2000s under multilateral,
regional, and unilateral reforms. EMDEs cut tariffs considerably to averages below 15 percent,
while advanced economies cut average tariffs from around 6 percent to below 3 percent (Figure 4).
However, a large gap remains between the ceiling rates bound in the WTO and applied tariff rates.
G20 developing countries, for example, have nearly a 20 percentage point excess of bound over
applied tariffs (Handley, 2014). The possibility that applied tariff rates could be substantially

increased can inhibit investment and trade, particularly in the presence of broader economic
uncertainty (Pierce and Schott, 2016a; and Constantinescu and others, 2017). “Peak” tariff rates
(above 15 percent) remain on 31 percent (11 percent) of agricultural tariffs of G20 developing (G20
developed) countries. A pattern of tariff escalation, with higher rates on more processed agricultural
products, protects higher value added activities from competition; advanced economies’ tariffs on
finished agricultural goods average 9 percentage points above those on raw agricultural products
(World Bank, 2015).

15.      Non-tariff measures (NTMs) are pervasive. Some NTMs represent the manifestation of
domestic regulations as applied to imported goods. While these may impact trade flows, their stated
aim is to protect health, workplace safety, the environment, or consumers. And while NTMs do not
typically discriminate between domestic and foreign producers, regulatory cooperation —where it
has been pursued—has helped to reduce costs and facilitate trade. Other NTMs, such as quantity
and price controls, act to interfere with the market pattern of trade more directly.

16.     The profile of NTMs differs across sectors and countries (Figure 5).5 Official data from
50 countries show that the share of imports subject to regulatory NTMs —including sanitary and
phytosanitary standards (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT) —is higher for AEs than for
EMDEs, reflecting AEs‘ more elaborate regulatory systems. In contrast, quantity and price controls,
which are more likely to distort trade directly, are more prevalent among low-income countries.
Across all income groups, regulatory NTMs are more prevalent for agricultural trade than for non -

agricultural trade; this is particularly true for low-income countries, where reported regulatory NTMs
for non-agricultural trade are less common.

Services
17.      Despite the overall importance of services in the economy, services trade remains
hampered by substantial policy barriers. While measuring restrictiveness in services trade faces
data and methodological challenges beyond those in goods trade, two mutually supportive
international initiatives, one led by the OECD, the other by the World Bank and WTO —provide
similar overall messages. The World Bank Services Trade Restrictions Database (and its
accompanying STRI) reveals that restrictions on entry, ownership, and operations of foreign service
providers remain common.6 Opaque and discretionary licensing can make market access
unpredictable in many countries, even when there is no explicit discrimination (Figure 6).7

 The database covers 103 countries and 5 major services sectors and the relevant modes of service delivery (Borchert
and others, 2014). Most information pertains to 2008–2010, with further updates for some countries.

    The index takes values from 0 (completely open) to 1 (completely closed).

18.     Services trade restrictiveness varies greatly across regions and sectors, and over time .
According to the OECD ’s Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (Figure 7), professional and transport
services are among the most protected industries in advanced as well as developing countries.8
Since 2014, a number of reforms aimed at reducing service restrictions have been adopted by a few
countries, including the lifting of foreign equity limits in one or more sectors (China, India, and
Indonesia), the liberalization of the telecommunications sector (Mexico) and easing of requirements
on establishing corporate residency (Japan). That said, countries have adopted tighter restrictions on
the temporary movement of people to provide services through Mode 4,9 such as subjecting
temporary services suppliers to tighter quotas and labor market tests, and shortened durations of
stay. Some countries have imposed new restrictions on the cross-border transfer of personal data.

    The OECD STRI, launched in 2014, covers 44 countries and 22 services sectors. See http://oe.cd/stri

  The WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) identifies four modes of services trade; Mode 4 refers to
the temporary movement of natural persons to supply services in another country. Others are the cross-border
supply of services (conceptually similar to trade in goods), consumption abroad (e.g., as a tourist), and the provision
of services by establishing a commercial presence in the other country (a concept related to foreign direct
investment).

Trade Agreements
19.     Bilateral and regional trade agreements have expanded dramatically in scope and in
number. The number of agreements notified to the WTO has risen from about 50 in 1990 to around
280 in 2015, while their scope has also expanded (WTO, 2011). A new World Bank database
documents the increasing “depth” of agreements, examining 52 policy areas and their legal
enforceability (Figure 8).10 More recent preferential trade agreement (PTAs) cover substantially more
policy areas than earlier PTAs, which focused primarily on tariff liberalization. Evidence points to a
strong link between trade agreements and exports, particularly with respect to “deep” agreements
that have broad policy coverage (Annex B).

20.      More than half of the PTAs include “deep” provisions in policy areas both within and
beyond the current mandate of WTO. The “WTO+” provisions include areas such as customs
regulations, export taxes, countervailing measures, and technical barriers to trade. Regarding areas
outside the current WTO mandate, a core subset of such “WTO-X” provisions (competition policy,
investment, movement of capital, and intellectual property rights protection) are included in one
third of PTAs.

Attitudes Toward Trade
21.       Although public attitudes toward trade remain generally favorable, they are down
slightly, especially in advanced economies. In AEs overall, the trough coincided with the onset of
the GFC; and while there has been some recovery since, attitudes in some countries remain less
favorable toward trade than in the early 2000s. However, public opinion surveys can provide mixed
messages about the level and direction of public support for trade , with attitudes at the “micro”
level (i.e., regarding the effects on individuals and localities) being generally less favorable than at
the macro level. For example, a recent Gallup Poll for the United States showed that 72 percent of
respondents viewed foreign trade as an opportunity, rather than a threat, the highest favorable

heterogeneity (Figure 9). Attitudes tend to be more positive among emerging Asian economies
with expanding manufacturing employment (Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam) and the
more open advanced economies with trade surpluses (Germany, South Korea, and Spain). Earlier
cross-country data indicate that perceptions toward trade are negatively influenced by increases in
the unemployment rate, increases in the trade deficit, and contractions in the relative output of the
tradeables sector (Hays, 2009).

23.      People more vulnerable to possible employment and wage impacts have been more
skeptical of trade . Overall, the public in AEs seems generally more skeptical of claims that trade
creates jobs and increases wages, especially in countries where manufacturing import penetration
has been stronger (Figure 10). This is also consistent with survey data showing that the attitudes
toward trade are less favorable among unskilled or less educated workers in those countries,
possibly because they may bear a disproportionate share of the dislocation costs from import

change—their jobs being at much greater risk of being replaced by developments in automation
and robotics.13 Meanwhile, data for EMDEs suggest little difference in attitudes across skill education
levels, and a far more favorable view on its impact on jobs and wages, especially in countries where
exports are labor intensive.

  A 2014 Pew Research Center survey finds a ten percentage point difference in favorable trade attitudes between
individuals with college and non-college education. Differences across education and skill levels are also found in
cross-country econometric analyses using earlier data (Scheve and Slaughter, 2001; Mayda and Rodrik, 2005). An
October 2016 Pew survey report suggests that differences also reflect the negative impact of technology and
automation trends on the less skilled (http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/10/06/the-state-of-american-jobs).

III. BENEFITS OF TRADE
24.     Trade integration is a powerful tool to raise growth and improve living standards.
(Annex C examines cross-country evidence on trade and growth.) Trade’s beneficial impact operates
through a number of channels, some of which are described in this section, but its role in promoting
productivity growth is central. Within sectors, greater competition that results from trade promotes
an expansion of the most productive firms and contraction or closure of the less efficient. And trade
makes available a wider range of intermediate production inputs, lowering firms’ cost s. Beyond
“production- side” benefits, trade also makes a wider variety of goods and services more accessible
to consumers at lower prices—a channel that tends to benefit lower-income households in
particular. This section will also touch on some of the wid er “non- economic” benefits from trade.

Increasing Productivity
25.     Experience demonstrates that international trade increases aggregate productivity.
A 138-country study attributed large positive productivity effects to trade openness, finding that a
1 percentage point increase in openness raised productivity by 1.23 percent in the long run (Alcala
and Ciccone, 2004).14 Within their sample of countries, this implies that an increase in openness from
the twentieth percentile to the median value raises productivity by 160 percent. More recent
evidence backs this up: for instance, Ahn and others (2016) estimate that a one percentage point
reduction in tariffs on inputs used in a sector improves total factor productivity in that sector by
2 percent.

26.     Individual country studies also point to significant sector-level productivity gains due
to trade for both advanced and emerging markets. For example, the Canada-U.S. FTA increased
Canadian labor productivity in the most impacted export-oriented industries by 14 percent, and that
of the most impacted import-competing industries by 15 percent (Trefler, 2004). Other studies have
documented how the same FTA also benefits the United States. Lower industry-level trade costs led
to substantial productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing during the late 1980s and the 1990s
(Bernard and others, 2006). Brazil’s 1988 -90 trade reforms brought large and widespread
productivity improvements across industries (Ferreira and Rossi, 2003): total factor productivity
growth increased by 6 percent, with a similar observed impact on labor productivity.

27.     Innovation and technology upgrading are key channels for increasing productivity.
Trade boosts productivity by promoting reallocation of resources, with production shifting toward
sectors and firms with comparative advantage and higher efficiency (De Loecker and Goldberg,
2014). But other productivity channels are also important. The ability to sell to a bigger market can
encourage firms to invest in innovation; for example, following the elimination of tariffs due to the
U.S.-Canada FTA, increased innovation by Canadian plants caused a 14 percent productivity increase


14
  The studies of trade and productivity address the reverse causality from productivity to trade by using instrumental
variables, such as the geographic component of countries’ overall trade (see Frankel and Romer, 199 9, and Annex C).




                       INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 19
(Lileeva and Trefler, 2010). Argentine firms increased technology spending by 20 to 30 percent in
response to Brazil’s reduced tariffs under Mercosur (Bustos, 2011). Import competition can also spur
technology upgrading. For example, as much as 15 percent of Europe’s technology upgrading over
2000 –2007 has been linked to increased competition from China (Bloom and others, 2015).

28.      Knowledge spillovers contribute to productivity growth as well. Firms also learn by
exporting. In Slovenia, this effect has been found to raise firms’ productivity level by 4.1 percent
(De Loecker, 2013). Studying 77 developing countries, Coe and others (1997) show that total factor
productivity is positively related to knowledge creation in trading partners. And an open trading
system contributes to knowledge diffusion through trade-related spillovers: Lumenga-Neso and
others (2005) demonstrate that the knowledge a country’s trading partners have access to (through
their trade relations with other countries) indirectly benefits that country as well.

29.     Trade enhances productivity indirectly by encouraging institutional reform, improving
governance, and contributing to financial deepening. Trade openness can weaken the political
power of existing business groups that might otherwise block institutional reforms. Promoting a
competitive environment and increasing growth opportunities may raise the needs of entrenched
firms for external capital and increase support for reforms that promote a deeper financial system;
greater trade openness is associated with a deeper financial sector (Rajan and Zingales, 2004; WTO,
2013). At the country level, a body of research links greater trade to less corruption, particularly as
trade opening reduces rent-seeking behavior (Krueger, 1974; Gatti, 2004). The ease of doing
business is strongly correlated with a country’s level of trade integration. At the firm level, trade
integration promotes better corporate governance and transparency (Tong and Wei, 2014),
management practices (Bloom and Van Reenen, 2010), and product quality (Amiti and Khandelwal,
2013).

Benefits for Consumers
30.      By lowering prices and providing access to a wider variety of goods and services, trade
and trade reform have major benefits for consumers through higher real incomes and greater
choices. Trade integration reduces consumer prices—directly, through lower tariffs on imported
final consumption goods (and related pro-competition effects), and indirectly through the
associated productivity gains of domestic and foreign firms. India’s trade liberalization, for example,
is estimated to have caused prices to fall by 18 percent, 15 with the largest reductions coming from
goods in industries with greater liberalization (Goldberg and others, 2010). Liberalization can also
lead to very large increases in the variety of goods available, and it is well known that the
introduction of new goods can have major effects on the cost of living (Hausman, 2003). In the




15De Loecker and others (2016). Marginal costs fell more than prices, implying additional short-run profits that firms
may have used to spur innovation. Indeed, Goldberg and others (2010b) attribute 31 percent of the new products
introduced by domestic firms to the impact of lower tariffs on inputs.




20    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
United States, for example, the value to U.S. consumers of the increase in import varieties between
the 1970s and the 2000s has been estimated at 2.6 percent of GDP (Broda and Weinstein, 2006). 16

31.     Just as lower tariffs can benefit vast segments of a country’s population, the
imposition of tariffs can be costly and have third-order effects on downstream industries. This
was evident in the case of the U.S. imposition of additional tariffs on Chinese tires imports in 2009,
which cost at least $900,000 for each job saved on an estimated annual basis —about 22 times the
average wage of those workers —and was associated with three times as many job losses in other
sectors (Hufbauer and Lowry, 2012).

32.     There is a strong “pro-poor ” bias in the benefits of lower prices and consumer choice
that comes with trade . Faijgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) estimate the effect of trade-induced
price changes on the real incomes of low-income and high-income households in forty different
countries. Relative to a hypothetical situation where countries close off trade altogether, the effect
of current levels of trade on prices has a pro-poor bias in all forty countries in their sample

16
  Completely eliminating trade has been estimated to reduce real income across a broad set of countries by an
average of 4 to 40 percent, depending on model specifications, largely due to the related reduction in consumption
and production varieties available to the country in autarky (Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare, 2014, Table 1).

(Figure 11). The pro-poor bias arises because poor consumers spend relatively more on sectors that
are more traded (e.g., food and beverages) and thus experience larger price drops upon opening to
trade. Higher-income households spend relatively more on less-traded sectors (e.g., some services).

33.      These important consumption-side effects of trade extend to certain other groups. For
example, single-parent households—which also typically spend more on tradable goods than
households at the top of the income distribution —tend to benefit disproportionately. The pro-poor
bias is stronger in advanced economies like Japan and the United States—opening up to trade
reduces the relative prices of the products on which a country is not specialized, and in advanced
economies those products happen to be the ones mostly consumed by the poor. Moreover, higher
trade openness reduces the incentives to pursue inflationary policies, which are themselves
particularly harmful to lower-income households (Romer, 1993).

              Example: Compared to existing trade patterns, in Germany (DEU) the real income of the
              poorest 10 percent of the population would be 56 percent lower if no trade was taking place;
              the gap for the richest 10 percent is far smaller (21 percent).

Other Benefits of Trade
34.      Trade can also contribute to greater social inclusion. Some of these additional benefits
are believed also to work indirectly to strengthen aggregate economic performance. Intensified
competition as a result of more open trade reduces the ability of firms to practice within-sector
wage discrimination against disadvantaged groups (Becker, 1957).17 In U.S. manufacturing from 1976
to 1993, Black and Brainerd (2004) find that the gender wage gap narrowed rapidly in initially more
concentrated industries that experienced larger increases in competition with trade reform. CEA
(2015) shows that U.S. industries with larger tariff declines experienced larger relative income gains
for female employees during 1989 –2009. Trade also has been associated with reduced racial wage
discrimination: Essaji and others (2010) find that trade reduced the U.S. race-related wage gap by
1.4 percentage points during 1983 –93. Klein and others (2010) confirm this pattern for German
manufacturing sectors from 1993 to 2007, demonstrating that increasing exports diminished the
gender wage gap as well as the pay gap between immigrants and non-immigrants. Research by the
ILO points to trade agreements that contain labor provisions promoting labor force participation,
particularly for females, such as by strengthening the social dialogue on labor conditions (ILO, 2016).




17The reasoning is that trade openness intensifies the competition and transparency to which domestic firms are
exposed; to survive, a firm needs to reduce inefficiency factors such as gender discrimination.

IV. TRADE AND ADJUSTMENT
35.     The reallocation of resources necessary to reap the substantial benefits that trade has
to offer can also have adverse consequences. To be sure, trade is not a main factor behind
increased inequality overall, as technology has played a key role (Helpman, 2016).18 However, recent
findings highlight that when reallocation is costly, adverse effects on certain individuals and
communities can be large and long-lasting if not addressed properly and promptly; these costs are
lower when growth is strong and labor markets are functioning smoothly. Understanding trade-
related adjustments costs is vital to formulate effective policies to mitigate them (Section V). This
section examines these trade-related costs and their sources.

36.      Trade triggers a reallocation of resources that changes the demand for labor and skills
and can affect wages, even in the absence of adjustment costs . When sectors differ in the
amounts of capital and labor they use, the relative expansion of the capital (labor) intensive sector —
whether because of trade or other reasons —tends to increase the relative return to capital (workers).
Furthermore, when workers differ in their skills and abilities, the impact of trade liberalization on
individual wages depends on the skill intensities of the exporting and import -competing sectors.
Within sectors, trade allows the more productive firms to expand and gives them incentives to
invest, including through technology upgrading. This tends to increase demand for skilled workers
in particular, and to put upward pressure on the skill premium even in low-skill intensive economies
(Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2007).

37.      These adjustments are essential to realizing the gains from trade, but may not be
smooth or immediate. The costs involved in resource reallocation can be large and long lasting
when adjustment is impeded, such as by mobility frictions and skill mismatches in the labor market,
leaving behind certain workers and communities. A growing literature aims to measure and
understand such trade-related adjustment costs, and views them as analogous to adjustment costs
arising from technological change or other forces.

38.      Studies of the reallocation process show that labor mobility frictions make adjustment
more costly and prolonged. These impediments include the costs of switching occupations,
industries, or regions, as well as labor market frictions such as those related to job security
legislation and imperfect credit markets.19 They can also lead to region- or industry-specific wage
differences (McLaren, 2017). Factor mobility frictions tend to be higher in developing economies
(Artuç and others, 2015). Higher frictions for female, older, and less skilled workers can exacerbate
the impact of trade adjustment on these workers (Artuç and McLaren, 2015).


18 The review by Helpman (2016) concludes that “the prevalent view that globalization is primarily responsible for the large inc rease
in inequality of labor compensation has no basis in evidence,” with factors such as technological change the main determinants.
19 Labor mobility costs may pertain to housing, retraining, and earnings forgone due to transitional unemployment. Capital mobility
frictions may also slow labor-market reallocation, and these include fixed costs or irreversibility of capital investment. Domestic
constraints such as poor institutions or underdeveloped infrastructure and capital markets that inhibit export expansion can also
affect wages (Hallaert and others, 2011).




24     INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
39.     Several studies attribute negative findings on trade and employment to such mobility
and labor market frictions (Menezes-Filho and Muendler, 2011; Kambourov, 2009). Evidence
suggests that Indian workers accept lower wages in a declining industry rather than move to cities
with expanding export industries, creating large wage differentials —in particular when declining
industries are located in poorer rural areas (Topalova, 2010). According to simulation exercises,
adjustment frictions in AEs can lead to transition periods of up to 10 years and reduce the gains
from trade by up to 30 percent (Artuç and others, 2013, Dix-Carneiro, 2014). (See also Annex D.)

40.     An unusual period of sharply increased import competition that began around 2000,
along with other factors, appears to have negatively impacted regional labor markets in some
AEs. Evidence on most episodes of trade increases suggests that the impact on aggregate labor
market outcomes has been mild.20 When EMDEs began to play a greater role in global
manufacturing trade, in part reflecting the impact of pro-market reforms in China, a series of studies
examined the impact on local labor markets during that period (Autor and others, 2016; Pierce and
Schott, 2016a). These studies show that areas more exposed to competition from Chinese
manufactures due to their industrial structure saw significant and persistent losses in jobs and
earnings, falling most heavily on low-skilled workers.

41.      These effects also impacted local services industries. Worker-level evidence suggests that
the decline in earnings of low-skilled workers is driven mostly by those who leave the manufacturing
sector and switch occupations. Taking into account cross-industry supply linkages and aggregate
demand effects, one study attributes to Chinese import competition some 17 percent (about
1 million) of total job losses in U.S. manufacturing during the period 1999 –2011, as well as
1.4 million non-manufacturing jobs (Acemoglu and others, 2016). This effect seems to have been
strongest during the period 2000 –07 (Autor and others, 2013). Estimates for France and Spain
indicate smaller impacts in those countries (Donoso and others, 2015; Malgouyres, 2016).

42.     These studies highlight the need for appropriate adjustment policies, rather than for
closing markets. Specific bilateral trade relationships tell a partial story; the negative labor market
outcomes that are the focus of these studies may be offset by positive outcomes from trade with
other countries (Ebenstein and others, 2015). For example, a study for Germany that looked at both
exports and imports finds that trade with China and Central Eastern Europe has led to net job
creation (Dauth and others, 2014). Also, the experience with intensified import competition from
China should not be overgeneralized: (i) Chinese output in the late 1990s and early 2000s grew
considerably faster than demand—a trend that is already reversing as China's GDP composition
changes; (ii) in the United States, labor market disruptions associated with the dot-com bubble burst
in the early 2000s may have exacerbated the negative impacts of import competition (Davis and
Wachter, 2011).


20
   On NAFTA, for example, see O'Leary and others, 2012. On the other hand, Trefler (2004) found that the 1989
Canada-United States FTA, while raising Canada’s manufacturing labor productivity by 6 percent on a sustained basis,
raised for about three years the level of unemployment in Canada.

43.      Overall, trade openness is associated with somewhat higher levels of employment.
Many labor market frictions are sector-specific, and unemployment spells tend to be longer in
sectors that face higher frictions. Evidence suggests, however, that the impact of trade on
unemployment through this channel is minor (Carrere and others, 2016). This finding is in line with
cross-country studies relating trade openness to long-run unemployment rates, which tend to show
that openness has small but positive effects on employment (Dutt and others, 2009). In explaining
long-run unemployment rates, economists point instead to the more relevant role of labor -market
institutions and technical change in driving employment (Berger and Frey 2016; Blanchard 2006 ).

V.      DOMESTIC POLICIES TO MITIGATE TRADE
        ADJUSTMENT COSTS
44.     Policies to facilitate adjustment can go far in addressing the potential downsides of
trade. Inattention to the adjustment pressures resulting from intensified import competition allows
the problems to become entrenched, which may also undermine public support for trade.21 This risk
is present with other types of shocks or policy changes, although several considerations favor policy
action to mitigate the adjustment costs resulting from trade policy changes in particular (Trebilcock,
2014). Different from other shocks, “trade shocks” in the form of intensified import competition
often arise from deliberate policy decisions to reduce protection.22 Mitigating adjustment costs can
help to alleviate resulting negative attitudes toward trade (Section II) and make trade openness
more socially sustainable.

45.       Challenges arising from trade liberalization resemble those due to technological
improvement. Both bring net benefits, but at the same time generate similar worker adjustment
costs that may be long-lasting if not properly addressed. Given the similarities of their impacts, and
difficulties in disentangling the effects of these shocks, policies aimed at mitigating trade-related
losses also help to mitigate shocks originating from technology and similar forces.23

46.     Special features of trade policy shocks are relevant in the design of mitigating policies.
Trade policy changes are typically permanent and their impact asymmetric across sectors, regions ,
and worker types. The impact is positive for some sectors (e.g., exporters) and negative for others.
The losses are often concentrated in import-competing sectors, leading to long-lasting
displacements as well as large earnings losses (OECD, 2005; Kletzer, 2001). 24 Moreover, workers
displaced from manufacturing tend to be older, less educated, and longer-tenured in the lost job
than workers displaced from other sectors, and in turn tend to take longer to return to work, which




21
   The need to complement trade liberalization with domestic policies was also a key message coming from the case
studies presented in G20 (2003). Observing a positive cross-country correlation between trade openness and
government spending, Rodrik (1996) points out that governments seek to mitigate the heightened external risks
emanating from openness by providing stronger social safety nets.
22
  Intensified import competition can also occur for other reasons, including market-opening reforms by the
exporting country, or subsidies by the exporting country.
23
   However, trade targeted programs can be cheaper than those that cover all shocks. See OECD (2005) and Kletzer
(2001) for a discussion of pros and cons of general versus targeted policies.
24
  The estimates of long-term average earnings losses from displacements range from 7–16 percent, depending on
the dataset and methodology employed (Couch and Placzek, 2010). Losses due to time spent out of work seem to
account for more of the total losses than lower wages after reemployment (OECD, 2012). Consistently, Fallick and
others (2012) argue that the earnings outcomes after a separation depend less on whether the worker was displaced
than on whether the worker experienced a jobless spell.




                       INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 27
exacerbates the associated losses (OECD, 2005; OECD, 2012; Kletzer, 2001).25 Such long spells of
unemployment also lead to worse health outcomes, higher mortality, lower achievements by
children of affected workers, and other adverse consequences (Pierce and Schott, 2016b; Autor and
others, 2015; Davis and von Watcher, 2011).

47.      Early and comprehensive action to improve labor mobility is a priority. Immobility
across sectors, regions, and skills is an increasingly important impediment to adjustment, and
policies to improve labor mobility should take center stage. Recent work analyzing the case of the
United States suggests declining interstate labor mobility (Dao and others, 2014), substantial non-
participation in the labor force after mass layoffs (Foote and others, 2015), and limited worker
migration from regions exposed to import penetration from China, resulting in increased
unemployment, decreased labor-force participation, and lower wages (Autor and others, 2013).26
Domestic migration in response to local employment shocks is even more limited in Europe (and to
some extent in Canada) than in the United States (Obstfeld and Peri, 1998). Understanding
impediments to geographic mobility is critical in the design of the policy response—although often
related to costly sectoral mobility (Hollweg and others, 2014; Artuc and others, 2010; Dix-Carneiro,
2014), in some cases they can be related to distortive housing-market policies.

48.     Labor-market policies need to be complemented by a host of other policies to support
adjustment. Macroeconomic stabilization policies should complement active labor-market policies
since displacement costs are known to be higher during downturns (Davis and von Watcher, 2011).
Measures that support competitiveness and productivity growth can ensure that displaced workers
find opportunities in the sectors and firms that can benefit from trade reform. Additional policies
may be needed to tackle rigidities in other markets. For example, credit policies can help fund self-
employment or human capital investment of displaced workers and physical capital of firms
(Bacchetta and Jansen, 2003). Housing market policies, including those that ensure well-functioning
mortgage markets, can improve geographical mobility, and regional policies can re-orient the
economies of the harder hit regions. Fiscal transfers from more to less fortunate regions can
substitute for outward migration and cushion the short-term costs, although they could end up
delaying the necessary adjustment to permanent shocks (Obstfeld and Peri, 1998).

49.       There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for mitigating the adjustment costs arising from
trade . Initial country conditions and structural characteristics, including the degree of factor market
flexibility; level of and access to education; depth of and access to financial, credit and insurance
markets; coverage and depth of social safety nets, and other considerations such as degree of
informality – relevant for EMDEs – should be taken into account in policy design and sequencing.

25
   Within manufacturing, however, the difference between displacements due to high foreign competition jobs and
due to other factors was much less significant. More recent studies (without conditioning on job separation) suggest
that adjustment costs due to trade shocks are larger for workers with low initial wages, low initial tenure, and low
attachment to the labor force (Autor and others, 2014).
26
  This is in contrast to earlier evidence (Blanchard and Katz, 1992), which highlights migration as the predominant
regional adjustment mechanism across U.S. states, with wages playing a small role.




28    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
Countries as diverse as Denmark and the United States have similar post-displacement rates of re-
employment, despite very different labor-market policies and structural characteristics (Kenworthy,
2010; OECD, 2016b; Annex E). More research is generally needed, including through experiments, to
evaluate the effectiveness of the various alternative programs. The ongoing basic income
experiment in Finland serves as a good example.

50.     The remainder of this section discusses the different policy alternatives, drawing on
the literature and country experiences. It develops a typology of policy alternatives and lays out
their pros and cons in light of country experiences and established best practices. (See diagram at
the end of this section.) The focus is on the policies to address the short-term adjustment costs as
opposed to any long-term distributional implications.

Labor-Market Policies
51.     Labor-market programs can play a key role in the adjustment process. When well-
designed and tailored to country circumstances, both active labor-market policies (such as job
search assistance and training) and passive policies (including income support and social insurance
programs) have been effective. The size and composition of these programs vary substantially
across countries (Figure 12).27 Nordic countries have the most expansive coverage, with relatively
generous unemployment insurance and training programs. Japan and the United States are at the
opposite end of the spectrum, spending less than 1 percent of GDP on both active and passive
programs. For given levels of spending, countries also differ in the speed and extent of engagement
with displaced workers.

52.     There are tradeoffs between active and passive labor market programs, although they
can also complement one another. Active programs alleviate the well-known moral hazard
problem arising from unemployment insurance. For example, placement in work or training
programs may provide an alternative to eligibility for unemployment benefits, since some of those
who are not genuinely interested in work or training will prefer to lose registration rather than
participate in a program. However, active programs can also hamper workers’ job search intensity as
workers get locked into training and job search programs. The balance between the use of active
and passive labor market programs will ultimately depend on a country’s labor market institutions
and rigidities.




27
     The data may also reflect the differential cyclical positions of the various countries in 2013.

Active Labor Market Programs (ALMPs)

53.     Well-designed ALMPs can facilitate reemployment and mitigate adjustment costs. We
outline below several key components of these programs, noting that experiences vary: 28

      Early and frequent engagement with displaced workers (or “activation strategies”) can
       improve outcomes. These strategies provide incentives for workers to increase job search
       intensity through benefit sanctions or mandatory participation in training or subsidized
       employment (Boeri and van Ours, 2008; OECD, 2015a). Generally, displaced workers are required
       to participate in interviews with employment counselors, apply for identified job vacancies,
       formulate individual action plans, accept offers of suitable work, and attend training programs if
       deemed necessary. A recent OECD study found that these activation strategies helped increase
       re-employment rates, especially in the case of those that are hard-to-place and the long-term
       unemployed, as may be the case with trade-displaced workers (OECD, 2015a). Early, frequent


28   Design of such programs needs to take into account current demographic trends and skills needed.




30         INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
       and personalized or targeted counseling seems to have been an integral part of the success.
       Moreover, benefit sanctions can speed up reemployment (van der Klaauv and van Ours, 2013).

      Training programs can help address the skills gap, although their impact varies
       substantially .29 Programs are more effective the nearer they are to regular jobs and when
       targeting disadvantaged outsiders (Brown and Koettl, 2015). Consistently, evidence from Canada
       (Riddell, 1995) and Sweden (Forslund and Krueger, 2010; Carling and Richardson, 2004) suggest s
       that on-the-job training is more effective than classroom training in raising the probability of
       employment. This is in line with the general finding that workers acquire far more skill-
       enhancing knowledge on the job than in the classroom (Jacobson, 1998). One way to alleviate
       the potential problem of workers training for jobs that do not exist is to establish strong ties
       between programs and the private sector. Consideration could also be given to establishing
       independent training authorities to organize and manage oversight of training provision.
       Singapore’s Institute for Technical Education , which provides career and technical education and
       develops national occupational skills certification and standards, is often referred to as a
       successful example of such a training authority (Almeida and others, 2012). At the regional level,
       a formal collaborative committee in Quebec with a central role in training-related decisions
       monitored local labor market developments at the onset of the global financial crisis (OECD,
       2015b), leading to a specific training program to fill the skills gaps anticipated during the
       economic downturn.

      Job search assistance can facilitate the matching process . Such assistance may be particularly
       helpful for older workers with long tenures in lost jobs who may lack the ability to identify good
       matches that are geographically and/or sectorally distant. Its main attraction relative to training
       programs is its low cost, but two caveats apply. First, with structural unemployment, as in the
       case of trade shocks, job search assistance alone is not enough since it does not address the
       need to change the skill structure of the workforce. 30 Second, recent research finds that those
       who receive job search assistance find jobs at the expense of other unemployed workers,
       imposing severe negative externalities on those who do not receive assistance, especially during
       economic downturns (Crepon and others, 2013).

      Wage subsidies, supplements, or insurance could be considered, but will need to be
       carefully designed. Such programs create incentives for workers to accept new employment
       faster by partially compensating them for the potential wage loss incurred in the new job. 31 As
       workers displaced due to trade incur long-term income losses and may need to build experience

29
  Such programs take forms such as subsidies to private firms for hiring workers in particular groups (the U.S. TJTC
or Work Opportunity Tax Credit); temporary work experience aimed at easing transition to work, typically in the
public sector; and on-the-job training to induce employers to provide job-relevant skills, including firm-specific skills.
30
     Job search could help in the event that it allows for better matches within the existing skill set (Kletzer, 2001).
31
  Under the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance program, the ATAA and RTAA are wage subsidies provided to certified
workers above the age of 50 (see Annex E). The idea of a wage insurance scheme to cover all dislocated U.S. workers
appears to date from Lawrence, Krause, Meyer, and Cohen in 1984; it has been the subject of subsequent proposals.




                           INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 31
     in a different sector, such compensation can help alleviate the initial income loss until the worker
     moves up the ladder in the new job. However, these wage insurance schemes can lead to moral
     hazard, which may arise on the side of the employers who may offer lower wages knowing that
     the workers will be compensated for their losses through the insurance mechanism. In fact, the
     evidence from wage subsidy programs is mixed. In their survey of 17 evaluation studies on
     advanced economies, Betcherman and others (2004) find that only six of the programs reported
     a positive impact on employment and only five on earnings. Similarly, a randomized experiment
     in Canada in 1995 –96 which tested wage supplements to dislocated workers resulted in
     inconclusive results (Bloom and others, 1999). The findings of a structural estimation exercise by
     Cosar (2013) using Brazilian data suggest that wage insurance in the spirit of U.S. ATAA/RTAA,
     but conditional on the new job being in the comparative advantage industry, would perform
     better than unemployment insurance both in terms of output dynamics and in compensating
     those that lose.

    Reemployment bonuses may help under certain circumstances. Evidence based on
     experiments conducted in various U.S. states suggests that re-employment bonuses can improve
     job-finding rates, bonuses to workers are more effective than those to the employers
     (Woodbury and Spiegelman, 1987), 32 and that bonuses targeted to the potential long-term
     unemployed can be cost effective (O’Leary and others, 2005). However, van der Klaauv and van
     Ours (2013) found that in the Netherlands, while penalties in the form of benefit sanctions were
     effective in speeding up exit from unemployment, incentives in the form of re-employment
     bonuses were not.

54.      The track record of ALMPs has been mixed, which may in part be due to the challenges
involved in assessing their impact. In an influential survey paper based on the evidence from
European and North American studies, Heckman and others (1999) concluded that public
employment and training programs had at best a modest positive impact on adult earnings and that
when earning gains occur, they are a result of increased employment probability as opposed to
higher wages.33 More recently, Card and others (2010) found substantial variation (in the sign and
significance) of the impact of programs across studies in their sample. Another survey focusing on
studies based on randomized controlled trials concludes that ALMPs have not been particularly
effective (Crepon and van der Berg, 2016). This mixed track record may be due to numerous
challenges in evaluation, measurement of indirect costs and benefits; and heterogeneity across
studies in the measurement of success and the time horizon captured (Brown and Koettl, 2015). For
example, since there can be a trade-off between shortening unemployment spells and attaining high
earnings after re-employment, as demonstrated by Engbom and others (2015) in an evaluation of

32
  Payments to workers seem to be more effective than those paid to employers also in the case of wage subsidies
(Dickert-Conlin and Holtz-Eakin, 2000).
33
  This study attributes the modest success of these programs to the level of per-capita expenditures on participants
(which have usually been small, relative to the adjustment costs being addressed), and the programs being targeted
toward relatively unskilled and less able individuals.

Germany’s Hartz reforms in the early 2000s . Measuring success by the re-employment probability or
unemployment insurance take-up could paint a different picture than post unemployment earnings.

Passive Labor Market and Social Protection Policies
55.      Unemployment benefits can complement ALMPs. Providing income support during
unemployment helps smooth consumption and can make it feasible for workers to engage in
training and job search, often outweighing well-known drawbacks. Such policies are already in place
in the developed world and some emerging markets covering all eligible unemployed, with the U.S.
TAA providing an extension of their duration for trade displaced workers (Annex E). Since some
activation policies are typically tied to unemployment benefits, consideration could be given to
strengthening these strategies and tailoring them to trade-displaced workers.

56.     Other aspects of labor-market policies, like employment protection and minimum
wage legislation, could be revisited. While employment protection legislation can reduce
displacements, it can also impede the needed reallocation. There is broad consensus that
employment protection should be limited, and that low hiring/firing costs coupled with protection
through unemployment benefits is preferable, as in the case of Nordic countries (Annex E on
Denmark). Similarly, minimum wage policies can protect low-skilled workers from exploitation and
ensure that they earn a basic level of income (Blanchard and others, 2013).34 However, the policies
will need to be designed carefully to avoid potentially negative employment and efficiency effects.
An overly high minimum wage, coupled with high payroll taxes, can hinder employment prospects
of vulnerable groups (OECD, 2006).

57.     Other social insurance and income support programs may be necessary to support the
longer-term dislocated workers and their families, but are costly. Some type of income transfer,
such as means-tested support or early retirement for older workers, is often provided to displaced
workers who no longer qualify for unemployment insurance. In countries where disability insurance
screening is not particularly stringent (U.S. and Northern Europe), these transfers can de-facto
become an important form of long-term income support (Bratsberg and others, 2010; Autor and
Duggan, 2003). Meanwhile, health insurance can also be part of the policy design, especially in
countries where access to affordable health services is more limited.35 More generally, reliance on
these other social insurance and income support programs is often costly and efforts should be
made to minimize incidences of dislocated workers dropping out of the labor force.




34
  The “basic income” or negative income tax have the same o bjective of providing a minimum standard of living
(Tyson, 2014). Such proposals are typically intended to deal with the consequences of automation and, unlike the
minimum wage, do not require the recipients to be employed.
35
  Kletzer and Litan (2001) favor including health insurance as a second component after wage insurance in their
proposal to relieve worker anxiety.

Complementary Policies
58.      A broader approach, beyond labor-market policies, will be necessary to ease
adjustment. Labor market policies should be complemented by macroeconomic stabilization
policies, as displacement costs during downturns are higher, and by measures that support the
economy’s competitiveness, as workers that are displaced for any reason are more likely to find new
opportunities in a growing economy. Moreover, efforts to address rigidities in other sectors may
also be necessary.

    Housing policies may be necessary to facilitate geographical mobility. Home ownership is often
     associated with longer housing tenure, given the search and transaction costs associated with
     buying and selling homes. While recent work suggests that the impact of homeownership on
     mobility is ambiguous (Coulson and Fisher, 2009), mobility from regions negatively affected by
     trade may be constrained by differences in housing price dynamics across regions. Supporting
     mobility from depressed communities may hence require that consideration be given to
     relocation allowances.

    Credit policies can facilitate the overall adjustment process. For workers, a well-functioning
     mortgage market and easy access to credit to help finance education, self-employment, or start-
     ups could ease adjustment. Credit to firms facing greater foreign competition could also help
     those firms reorient their business models and invest in new or different technology. Credit to
     potential exporter firms can facilitate entry and help harness the benefits from trade (Manova,
     2013).

    “Place -based” policies can help revive economic activity in harder-hit regions. Despite the
     presence of agglomeration and human capital spillovers, a prominent view has been that place-
     based policies could create important distortions, and the case for using limited public funds to
     encourage less advantaged people to stay in economically weak regions was unconvincing
     (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2008; Moretti, 2011). In their review of the empirical literature, Neumark
     and Simpson (2014) conclude that enterprise zone programs did not necessarily improve
     employment outcomes. However, there are noteworthy exceptions. Recent evidence from the
     U.S. Empowerment Zone program, comprising employment tax credits for firms and block
     grants for infrastructure investment, business assistance, training, etc., suggests substantial
     increases in employment and wages for local workers (Busso and others, 2013). Similarly, the
     evidence from the French Zones program (Franches Urbaines) points to higher business creation
     and employment, yet with offsetting declines in surrounding areas (Givord and others, 2013).
     Discretionary grant schemes employed in a number of European countries offer subsidies to
     private firms to promote inward investment and they appear to have a better track record
     (compared to enterprise zone programs), perhaps reflecting the closer monitoring of grant
     recipients (Neumark and Simpson, 2014).

    Education policies are necessary to arm individuals with the proper skills. Studies suggest that
     labor market outcomes depend not only on technical skills, but also on a wide range of


34    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
     cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Heckman and others, 2006). These findings highlight the
     importance of strengthening early childhood, primary and secondary schooling (Almeida and
     others, 2012) with a view to ensure that future workers adapt well to a rapidly changing
     economic and technological environment.

Trade-Specific Programs
59.      Well-designed and targeted trade-specific support programs can complement existing
labor-market programs. As previously discussed, workers displaced by trade or technological
change are more likely to require retraining than those who lose their jobs due to cyclical or firm-
specific reasons, since trade and technology shocks are associated with long-lasting structural
transformations. In addition, targeted programs may be more effective in reducing opposition to
trade openness. The most prominent examples of such programs are the U.S. TAA and the EU
European Globalization Adjustment Fund (EGAF). A number of reforms and programs in Latin
America, such as Mexico’s PROCAMPO (1993 –94), were aimed at dealing with the consequences of
trade liberalization.

60.      The effectiveness of these trade-specific programs has been mixed, however, and their
coverage and size tends to be very small. A comprehensive evaluation of the U.S. TAA found that
training obtained did not improve earning and employment outcomes (D’Amico and others, 2007),
although others found support for the training component (Park, 2012). 36 That said, TAA and EGAF
had budgets of 800 million USD (2015) and 115 million EUR (2014), respectively, tiny fractions of
these countries’ GDPs. Moreover, these prog rams suffer from the lack of workers’ awareness of their
existence (Cernat and Mustilli, 2016; European Commission, 2011). For example, the take-up rate of
the TAA was about 40 percent of eligible workers (Rosen, 2008) and even smaller for ATAA/RTAA
(the wage insurance module of the TAA). The low take-up rates for wage insurance were linked
partially to lack of knowledge about the program (D’Amico and others, 2007). The evidence from
EMDEs is scant, as their programs have typically not been part of a comprehensive strategy to deal
with displacements. Instead, they have been implemented on an ad hoc basis (e.g., to protect
farmers in Mexico) and later integrated into the broader social safety net programs (Hollweg and
others, 2014).




36 Accordi ng to Schochet and others (2012), TAA pa rticipants used reemployment and training s ervices more frequently a nd
were more likely to s witch industries a nd occupations than a comparison group of non -participants. However, in the final year
of the follow-up period, TAA participants had l ower earnings, especially i n the case of older workers.

VI. BUILDING STRONGER RULES-BASED TRADE
61.       The current rules-based global trading system grew out of the calamities of the Great
Depression and Second World War. Coming on top of monetary and financial factors, the spread
of trade restrictions severely aggravated the Great Depression of the 1930s, as one country after
another increased barriers to trade in the hope of protecting itself from the growing crisis. The
resulting breakdown in the trade system that had underpinned the global economy prior to the First
World War was swift and lasting. Piecemeal efforts such as at the 1933 World Economic Conference
did little to avert the widespread protectionism that obstructed recovery, and as countries embarked
on a second world war in the late 1930s, global trade remained below its level of 1929 (Irwin and
others, 2009; Gregory and others, 2010).

62.     The rules-based trading system remains a pillar and a key strength of the global
economy. A return to pre-Depression levels of trade openness followed only after decades of tariff
reductions under the GATT system, which was established in 1948, complementing the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank. That system has been highly effective in reducing trade barriers,
bringing more countries under common trade rules, expanding those rules to cover more of global
trade, and securing the transparency of trade policy and the enforcement of trade rules. In
particular, the enforcement of trade rules was strengthened significantly with the establishment in
1995 of the WTO and its more powerful dispute settlement mechanism.

63.      Policy transparency and strong, well-enforced rules can promote competition and
reassure the public that international trade is evenhanded. This pertains to conventional trade
measures, as well as other ‘behind-the- border’ measures affecting trade. The multilateral trading
system has been instrumental in integrating the global economy and has underpinned the stability
of world trade by helping to prevent new waves of protectionism – even 1930s-style trade wars – in
the wake of various economic and geopolitical shocks, including the GFC. By bringing the rule of law
to international trade, GATT/WTO dispute settlement has helped protect countries against actions
such as the misuse of technical barriers to trade, injurious dumping, and various types of subsidies
and state support. The use of the system is growing rapidly among EMDEs – a sign of their growing
role in global trade, the importance they attach to the rules-based multilateral trading system, and
how they see the role of trade in economic growth and development (WTO, 2015; WTO, 2007).

64.       At the present juncture, stronger rules-based trade integration is critical to share trade
benefits more widely, in terms of more and better jobs, and to drive broad-based global
growth. With respect to trade policies, this begins by avoiding increases in trade restrictions,
subsidies, and other trade distortions, and rolling back those introduced since the global financial
crisis, as documented in the periodic WTO monitoring reports.37 Further opening to trade, in
particular through negotiations at the global level, would enhance productivity and raise incomes .
Progress in traditional areas like agriculture is important, and opening areas like services and digital

                         INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 37
trade can make particularly large contributions to global economic growth, given their size, close
links to other sectors, and current high trade barriers. Greater use of recent innovations to re-
energize trade integration may be needed.

Role of Trade-Related Policies to Help Share Gains Widely
65.      Open markets and reduced trade distortions abroad complement and facilitate
adjustment at home. The importance of open global markets extends beyond the impact on
overall incomes: they also help in the domestic adjustment process. When dealing with greater
import competition in making widgets, for instance, a country must be able to expand output in
areas of its export interest —whether in agriculture, services, or manufactures —in order to adjust
smoothly. Trade barriers abroad that frustrate export expansion will prolong the domestic
adjustment process. Domestic policies that encourage worker mobility and training will still help, but
their effectiveness will be magnified by open, secure access to export markets. This underscores the
importance of reducing overall levels of trade distortions, including conventional trade measures,
subsidies, and other forms of state support, and drawing particular attention to areas where
distortions remain high.

66.     A country’s own trade policies can also play a role in easing adjustment. For example,
advanced announcement and gradual phasing of trade liberalization can help to avoid labor market
bottlenecks and congestion, and can buy time to put in place domestic cost mitigating policies
(Bacchetta and Jansen, 2003). This is especially true when a rapid increase in import competition is
concentrated in a sector or region. At the same time, these policy decisions are not one-size-fits-all,
and potential advantages should be weighed against the costs of delaying the benefits (Trebilcock,
2014). Temporary import safeguards are another policy measure that may be appropriate in
exceptional circumstances, and when consistent with a country’s WTO obligations. Knowing that
recourse to safeguards is possible can give a country greater confidence in pursuing reforms;
however, any consideration of invoking safeguards should take into account their adverse effects of
additional import restrictions on domestic workers in downstream industries, the additional costs to
consumers, and the impact on policy uncertainty.

67.     The complexity of the trade policy landscape has raised important challenges, but
various avenues of international cooperation can help to make trade stronger and more
sustainable. Binding and enforceable provisions, and “soft law” provisions, in trade agreements are
often preferable, but other approaches to trade-related issues are sometimes more effective, or
more feasible initially. These include other types of international agreements, international norms,
international policy cooperation and the provision of policy advice from international institutions.
For instance:

    Noting that excess capacity in some industries had negatively impacted trade and workers, in
     2016 G-20 leaders created the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, supported by the OECD, to
     enhance cooperation regarding industrial overcapacity and to encourage adjustment.

    Abidance by and enforcement of core ILO labor standards can be an important tool for
     development and can reassure domestic workers that international competition is evenhanded.


38    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
    Labor provisions have been included in certain RTAs, and for a developing country entering a
    trade agreement with a more advanced economy the combination of increased export demand
    and these labor provisions—which may also involve related technical and financial assistance —
    can provide a positive environment for enhanced labor protection. Whether done through a
    trade agreement or other means, international cooperation on labor standards can take
    appropriate account of local conditions, without necessarily requiring that standards be identical
    across countries in different circumstances.

   Similarly, a shared commitment to environmental standards can, in addition to environmental
    benefits themselves, help to reassure domestic firms and workers that they are not
    disadvantaged by strong environmental standards at home. Coherence between trade and
    environmental agreements can help to attain policy objectives in both areas. As with labor
    issues, cooperation on environmental standards can take place in a variety of fora, with
    appropriate account being taken of local conditions that would not necessarily require standards
    in different countries to be the same.

   Dialogue and cooperation on macroeconomic policy issues through the G -20, IMF, OECD, and
    other fora can minimize disruptions to the global economy and promote an environment more
    conducive to trade. For example, for countries transitioning toward a market economy, the IMF
    has provided policy advice in support of the authorities’ reform objectives with respect to state -
    owned enterprises and industrial overcapacity, as part of a broader push to rebalance an
    economy toward consumption.

Role of Re-Energizing Global Trade Reform
68.       The slower pace of reform since the early 2000s and post-crisis uptick in new trade
distortions leaves a large agenda for trade reform. Despite important recent steps, such as the
entry-into-force of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in February 2017 , measures such as
tariffs, subsidies, and restrictions on services trade continue to weigh on trade. Further trade reform
can go far in promoting stronger global economic growth (IMF, 2016b).

69.       Addressing tariffs and other traditional trade barriers is a key agenda item. Significant
tariffs remain, especially in agriculture and in key manufacturing sectors (Section II). Further cuts to
MFN bound and applied rates would promote policy certainty and further open trade, helping also
to resolve today's patchwork of tariff preferences and rules of origin. Further disciplining NTMs,
including subsidies in agriculture and other areas, would help to level and strengthen the global
trading environment.

70.     Reforms in services and other ‘frontier ’ areas have great potential to promote growth.
Services account for two-thirds of global GDP and employment; as technological and structural
change brings new opportunities, further opening international services flows will expand global
trade and promote key enablers of economic growth such as transport, communications, finance,
and data processing. The growing digitization of economic activity —and the globalization of the
internet—is giving rise to new tradable products, new ways of trading, and new strategies for
organizing global production. While existing multilateral and regional trade rules already cover



                     INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 39
many aspects of digital trade, there may be a need to update countries' specific commitments and
to clarify and enhance rules in certain areas.

71.     Cooperation on a variety of trade-relevant policies is increasingly important. Integrated
global production structures, involving the exchange of components, services, investment, and
technology among interlinked global production networks, requires reforms across several policy
areas. This is particularly evident regarding trade and investment, which are increasingly interlinked
facets of regional and global value chains, and for which reforms to one policy area work best when
the other is reformed as well. Frontier issues such as services and investment require cooperation
among diverse regulatory systems, often led by different agencies, underscoring the need for
coherent policy approaches.

New WTO Approaches in a More Complex Trade Policy Landscape
72.      An open, stable global trading system rests on a strong WTO at its center. Regional and
bilateral trade agreements can bring important benefits, including by leading the way on certain
‘frontier’ issues and by expanding, for example, on WTO obligations and commitments on services
or intellectual property. They also can establish useful rule-making precedents for action at the
global level, and reinforce countries' willingness and resolve to advance WTO reforms in areas of
common interest.38 Nonetheless, there is great benefit in a shared institutional underpinning at the
global level—above all a core set of rules, a strong enforcement mechanism, and a common forum
for cooperating on policy and sharing information, which would help to reduce overall levels of
trade distortions, including conventional trade measures, subsidies, and other forms of state
support. In this respect, the WTO's institutional and legal framework, near universal membership,
and its ability to apply positive steps in RTAs at the global level are unique advantages that cannot
be replicated in RTAs. Moreover, many issues—from farm subsidies to digital trade—are inherently
global and best solved through global cooperation and rule-making.

73.    Greater complexity in the trade policy landscape has raised challenges in negotiations.
The Uruguay Round, concluded in 1994, required that all issues be considered part of a "single
undertaking" to which all Members had to agree. Not only did the agenda become increasingly
complex—as the number of subjects, countries, and trade-offs expanded—but linkages meant that
the most difficult issues often slowed or blocked progress on the easier and doable ones.

74.     Recent advances show the value of global approaches and the adaptability of the WTO
negotiating system to new challenges, such as through continuous and more narrowly
focused negotiations. The WTO was created in part to facilitate the flow of agreements of all kinds.
Indeed, recent advances at the WTO Ministerial Conferences in Bali (2013) and Nairobi (2015)
involved smaller "packages" of issues —where the range of subjects covered was narrower, a


38
   Much of our understanding of the economics of preferential tariff reductions comes from Viner (1950) and th e
idea of “trade diversion.” Recent RTAs still present this issue, but also often involve features such as regulatory
cooperation that may be implemented on a non-discriminatory basis and do not raise the issue of trade diversion.




40    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
convergence of interests was possible, and members had a shared stake in reaching agreement.
Achievements like the Trade Facilitation Agreement, the Expanded Information Technology
Agreement (ITA), and the Decision on Eliminating Agricultural Export Subsidies offer important
lessons for negotiations in other areas.

75.      Advances have also taken place through engagement with a more limited
membership, or "plurilateral" negotiations, as well as universal ones. Multilateral trade rules
have always recognized that not all Members can —or should—be expected to accept the same
rules or commitments—and this is increasingly true in a diverse WTO of 164 Members.39 Rules in
areas such as domestic regulation often are inherently non-discriminatory and not easily tailored to
specific trade partners; this suggests that calculations of reciprocity may be less relevant to
multilateral negotiations in such areas, with more scope for "critical mass" undertakings. Even non-
MFN plurilateral agreements reached inside the WTO (such as the GPA), in which benefits are not
automatically extended to non-participating WTO members, have a key advantage over preferential
RTAs reached outside the WTO because they are more transparent, have legal and institutional links
to the WTO, and provide a clear path for expanded membership and possibly to a full multilateral
agreement.

76.     Advances have also continued using universal agreements, with individualized
commitments explicitly linked to resource capacity. The TFA breaks new ground as the first WTO
agreement in which Members determine their own individual implementation schedules and in
which their implementation progress is explicitly linked to technical and financial support. It sets out
a framework for technical assistance and capacity building to help countries adapt and modernize
customs systems, in line with TFA provisions; the WTO ’s TFA Facility complements existing efforts
from bilateral donors and development agencies.

77.      Continued efforts for cooperative solutions to shared challenges remain of essence.
The trade facilitation negotiations were driven more by the search for cooperative solutions to
shared challenges—such as standardizing customs procedures and harmonizing documentation —
than by a drive for market access. This experience has enhanced recognition that countries stand to
benefit most by reforming their trade procedures collectively, not just individually. Looking ahead,
an emphasis on expanding cross-border cooperation is also relevant to cross-border regulatory
issues, where the objective is not to "de-regulate" but to minimize regulatory frictions by exploring
ways to advance shared policy objectives in a least trade restrictive way.




39
  The ITA expansion was negotiated among a "critical mass" of WTO members, but its benefits are extended to other
WTO members on an MFN basis. In contrast, under the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) the
obligations—but also the rights and benefits—are limited to signatories (that is, “non-MFN”). The GPA is open to
accession by other WTO members.

VII. FINAL REMARKS
78.     The opening of trade over the past several decades has helped to drive global
economic growth, lifting incomes across advanced, emerging, and developing countries.
However, a prolonged period of disappointing economic growth and inadequate attention to those
left behind by forces such as trade, globalization, and technology has spurred increased skepticism
over open trade in some quarters. Countering this by better communicating the benefits of trade,
and better sharing these benefits with those affected by trade-related dislocations, are critical to
restoring strong, inclusive global growth. These efforts should be complemented with well-crafted
further trade reforms and continued enforcement of global trade rules.

79.      This paper has stressed the role of supporting domestic policies and prompt attention
to those individuals and communities at risk of being left behind. Key policy initiatives such as
training, temporary income support, job search assistance, and targeted trade adjustment assistance
are important. Approaches beyond labor market policies —such as education, housing, and regional
policy—are also needed. These approaches need to be tailored to a country’s circumstances and
specific policy objectives, but international agencies can help to share valuable cross country
experiences.

80.      Together with domestic policies, further trade integration and strengthening of the
rules-based trading system will contribute to inclusive global growth. This endeavor begins
with resisting further trade restrictions and domestic policy interventions, like subsidies, that distort
trade, and by removing existing ones. Traditional areas, such as agriculture, need further attention,
while sectors such as services as well as digital trade represent areas where further trade reform can
make particularly large contributions to global growth. While RTAs can bring substantial benefits
and help to expand the trade policy frontier, they are not enough on their own; with its unique
institutional and legal foundation, as well as broad membership, agreements through the WTO —on
a multilateral basis, where possible—represent the best way to secure stronger rules-based global
trade.

81.      Trade and trade-related policies have a role to play not just in promoting growth and
prosperity, but helping to share that prosperity more widely. Importantly, further opening
global markets will help to promote smooth and less costly domestic adjustment, whether to trade,
technology, or other types of developments. Strong, well-enforced trade rules help to promote
competition and to reassure citizens that international competition is evenhanded. Dialogue and
cooperation on macroeconomic and other policy issues, through the G -20 and other fora, can help
to promote an environment more conducive to economic stability and growth —which, support and,
in turn, are supported by, an open, rules-based global trading system.

Annex A. Trade, Growth, and Poverty in Developing Countries
82.     The impact of trade on poverty is central to the development debate. The joint 2015
publication of the World Bank and WTO, The Role of Trade in Ending Poverty, supports this through
a review of the evidence and main policy issues. 40 It emphasizes the importance of trade openness
to poverty reduction and growth in developing countries and stresses the vital role of a stable
macroeconomic environment and complementary domestic policies. In such an environment, the
channels through which trade will promote economic growth and rising incomes resemble those in
richer countries, with particular emphasis on trade’s role in driving innovation and promoting
competition.

83.      As discussed in this report, trade can stimulate growth in a number of ways. These
include making affordable capital goods and intermediate inputs more available, enhancing
competition, improving institutions, facilitating exploitation of scale economies, and catalyzing
technological progress. Yet —even more than in the advanced economies —none of these benefits
are either automatic or immediate; the greatest gains from trade will be realized only with
appropriate macroeconomic policies, strong institutions, access to finance, well-functioning labor
markets, and other features. Moreover, households will be impacted differently depending on
physical and human capital endowments, their consumption patterns, and their income-generating
activities. If globalization results in lower (or higher) food prices, for instance, that could hurt or help
the poor depending on whether they are net consumers or net producers of food.

84.     While the impact of trade on poverty depends on country-specific circumstances, the
overall empirical evidence is strong. Cross country data show that openness is associated with
accelerated growth in average incomes, and that growth is associated with poverty reduction. For
example, the income growth of the bottom 20 percent increases almost 1 for 1 with average income
growth.41 Although causality is hard to establish, this fact pattern suggest that openness promotes
poverty reduction by accelerating growth . Figure A.1 offers prima facie evidence of the impact that
trade had on poverty reduction in developing countries in the period 1993 –2008. The figure shows
that the change in real income of the lowest quintile of the population in developing countries is
strongly correlated with the change in openness over the same period.

85.     These stylized facts are consistent with a range of microeconomic studies that have
documented that trade liberalizations often have pro-poor impacts, either by reducing the
costs of consumption or by increasing (real) incomes. The 2001 US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade
Agreement, for instance, led to poverty reduction in Vietnam by increasing wage premia in export-
oriented sectors, catalyzing job reallocation from agriculture, forestry and fishing into

40 Direct empirical evidence on the question of trade and poverty reduction is limited by data availability and the
difficulty of distinguishing the distributional impact of globalization from that of other factors, such as technological
progress and institutions, that may modulate how trade impacts the welfare of different households.

manufacturing, and by stimulating enterprise job growth (McCaig, 2011). Similarly, MERCOSUR
benefited poor and middle class Argentine households relatively more than rich households (Port,
2006). Yet, increased trade does not always reduce poverty, as trade may also reduce the (relative)
wages of the poor. Some evidence suggests this is what happened in India in the 1990s, where
poverty decreased less in rural districts more exposed to trade liberalization. 42 Initial market
conditions and specific patterns of liberalization may partially explain these different trends. Even
when trade on average benefits the poor, however, there are typically some households that stand
to lose.

86.       The extent to which trade has the potential to reduce poverty is fundamentally
dependent on the institutional environment (World Bank and WTO, 2015). Enabling the poor to
reap the full benefits of trade demands policies that enable them to accumulate the human and
physical capital required to seize the opportunities that globalization offers (Porto and Brambilla,
2011). It also requires minimizing intra-national frictions such as those associated with market
imperfections (such as oligopolistic retailers) and transport costs. These types of frictions often have
a disproportionate impact on the poor who tend to be concentrated in relatively remote areas.
Finally, it requires minimizing adjustment costs, and insuring the poor against the potential risks that
globalization entails. These are all areas in which strong institutions can help to achieve a broader
sharing of the benefits of trade.

          Annex B. Impact of Trade Agreements on Exports
87.     Evidence points to a strong link between trade agreements and increased exports. An
analysis of all papers estimating gravity equations published in leading economic journals in the
2006-2012 period finds that free trade agreements increase bilateral trade by around 40 percent
(Head and Mayer, 2014). Baier and Bergstrand (2007, 2009) find trade agreements increase trade by
around 100 percent in the long run, using instrumental variables and nonparametric (matching)
econometric techniques. “Deep” trade agreements that cover issues such as investment and
competition policy appear to have even stronger effects (Mattoo and others, 2017). These results are
also supported by the use of alternative empirical approaches, such as synthetic control methods.
Synthetic control methods help to identify whether the changes in the actual levels of trade in the
period following the introduction of a new trade agreement are due to the agreement or to other
influences (Hannan, 2016).

88.     Synthetic controls are an econometric tool for comparative studies where the control
unit is determined by a systematic, data-driven procedure. A synthetic (artificial) control unit is a
weighted average or linear combination of the untreated units. The weights are chosen such that
both the outcome variable and its observable covariates/determinants are matched with the treated
unit before treatment . The evolution of the actual outcome of the treated unit post-treatment i s then
compared against the outcome of the synthetic unit, and the difference is interpreted as the
treatment effect. Intuitively, synthetic controls use a weighted average of the outcome of the control
units to estimate the counterfactual outcome of the treated unit.

89.     When this method was used to examine the experience of 104 pairs of countries that
entered a trade agreement between 1983 and 1995, the results suggest that the agreements
markedly increased exports for most countries. The average gross exports of countries with trade
agreements is 80 percentage points higher over the next ten years using this methodology ; this
translates into a boost in the annual rate of export growth of 3.8 percentage points. The export
gains are particularly high for small countries, and for emerging markets when they have trade
agreements with advanced markets. Advanced economies exporting to emerging markets had
smaller export gains. There were 24 country pairs (approximately a quarter of the cases) for which
the analysis suggests possible declines in exports owing to trade agreements.

 Annex C. The Effect of Trade on Real Incomes: Cross-country
                           Evidence
90.      Estimating the causal effect of trade on income is complicated by the fact that some
variables that affect income directly (that is, not just through trade) also affect trade itself.
This is the case, for example, of regulatory behind-the-border barriers, which may affect income
through channels other than international trade. Thus, estimates based on simply regressing income
on some measure of trade will generally be inconsistent. A well-known paper by Frankel and Romer
(1999) sought to address this issue by isolating the component of trade that is driven by pre-
determined exogenous characteristics of each country. In particular, they instrument trade openness
through a gravity equation that only includes geographical characteristics, such as a country’s
proximity to other countries or whether it is landlocked. 43

91.     Cross-country evidence suggests that the effect of trade on income has remained
consistently positive over time, although it has somewhat diminished since the global
financial crisis. Using 1985 data, Frankel and Romer (1999) find that a one percentage point
increase in openness (exports plus imports as a share of GDP) causes real income to be
2 to 3 percent higher. To understand whether these estimates have remained stable, Figure C.1
reproduces the exercise of Frankel and Romer using yearly samples from 1990 through 2014 (see
Cerdeiro and Komaromi, forthcoming). A one-percentage-point increase in trade openness raises
real per capita income by 2 to 6 percent. These estimates of the long-run income effect of trade
have not remained constant; after hovering around 4 to 5 percent since the early 1990s, the
estimate fell to nearly 2 percent after the global financial crisis. While the reasons for this decline are
hard to pin down, the results are indicative of the pressing need for complementary structural
reforms that can lift growth.44

92.     Policies need to address short and medium term adjustments. Given that the results are
based on cross-country data, they should be interpreted as the long-run estimated effect of trade
on growth. Thus, the estimates do not shed light on possible temporary adjustment costs from
greater integration. Moreover, it is worth noting that although the estimates indicate that over time
there are substantial benefits from trade, they are silent about the channels through which this
effect operates. Consequently, the micro-level evidence of the main text of this paper is a necessary
complement to design optimal policies that tap trade integration to spur growth.




43 Rodri guez a nd Rodrik (2000) a rgue that geography ca n also affect income through i ts effect on i nstitutions (see also Rodrik
a nd others, 2004). Dollar a nd Kra ay (2003) point out that, due to the very high correlation between tra de a nd measures of
i ns titutional quality, regressions including both va riables tend to be uninformative. Feyrer (2009) ci rcumvents the problem of
phys i cal distance possibly havi ng an effect on income through other channels (e.g. institutions) by exploiting the “s hortening”
of s ome bilateral distances due to improvements in air tra nsportation technology; the paper also finds a positive effect of
tra de on income. Similar qualitative results a re also found in Feyrer (2009b), who uses the 1967–1975 cl osing off of the Suez
Ca na l as a natural experiment to i nvestigate the trade-income ca usal relationship.

     Annex D. Identifying and Quantifying Adjustment Frictions
93.      Understanding adjustment frictions, whether in the context of adjusting to
technology, the normal churn of the labor market, or trade, can help to better tailor policies
to address them. Many things impede workers from switching firms, sectors, or regions. These
frictions can be broadly grouped into skill mismatches, geographic frictions, policy distortions, and
capital mobility. The following paragraphs summarize the empirical evidence on the size and
importance of the different types of frictions. Section V discusses adequate policy responses.

    Skill mismatches: Industry- or firm-specific job skills may not easily be transferred across firms
     or industries. This makes it costly to change jobs, slowing adjustment in the face of intensified
     import competition or other developments (Lamo and others, 2011). For workers these costs
     include the need for retraining, longer unemployment spells, or lower starting wages in a new
     job requiring different skills. When switching industries within manufacturing, workers in
     developed countries have been estimated to forego in terms of lifetime income the equivalent
     of 2.76 times their annual wage (Artuç and others, 2015). Switching occupations may have
     similar costs, although these costs vary substantially across occupations and skill levels, with
     college-educated workers experiencing on average lower costs (Artuç and McLaren, 2015).
    Geographic frictions: Workers and families can face a range of obstacles when relocating to
     expanding regions, such as job search and travel costs. Other factors include social networks,
     family and friends, housing policy, migration restrictions, and cultural barriers. An example of a
     migration restriction is the household registration system Hukou in China, which gives special
     rights to workers native to a region. Zi (2016) estimates that this has reduced China's gains from
     trade markedly.

    Policy distortions: Job protection regulations and certain other policies may impede both the
     contraction and expansion of firms following trade or other reforms. The benefits of trade are
     reduced when policy thwarts labor market flexibility (Bolaky and Freund, 2004). For example,
     Kambourov (2009) finds that inflexibility in Mexico’s labor market slowed the reallocation of
     labor in response to trade reform, so that the benefits of the reform were as much as 30 percent
     less than would have been achieved under a more flexible labor market.

    Capital mobility : Scaling up production often requires new capital in addition to new workers.
     Therefore, high capital adjustment costs significantly impede labor adjustment as well. Examples
     include high upfront fixed costs or investment irreversibility in the case of physical capital. Dix-
     Carneiro (2014) finds that the reallocation in the labor market following trade liberalization in
     Brazil would accelerate from 14 years to 4 years if capital was completely mobile.

94.     The frictions discussed here may affect workers with different characteristics
differently (Dix-Carneiro, 2014). Often the costs for female, older, or less educated workers are
particularly high.

            Annex E. Adjustment Policies: Country Experience
Country experience with adjustment policies varies. This annex reviews some of the policies taken and
challenges facing EMDEs, Denmark, and the United States.


A. Challenges to Mitigating Trade-Related Dislocations in EMDEs
Compared to advanced economies, many EMDEs are characterized by larger informal sectors, weaker
institutions, and lower education levels. These features potentially aggravate costs arising from
adjustment to trade shocks and complicate design of mitigating policies.

95.       Evidence points to limited sectoral labor reallocation in the face of trade shocks in EMDEs.
In an influential survey paper, Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) find that trade liberalization episodes in
EMDEs are generally followed by limited sectoral reallocation and more pronounced wage than
employment response to the shock. Consistently, Artuc, Lederman, and Porto (2015) estimate large labor
mobility costs in EMDEs and establish that these costs are negatively correlated with various
development measures, including GDP per capita and educational attainment. Adjustment is longer and
costlier when labor mobility costs are higher. Strong employment protection policies in the formal sector,
coupled with public work programs, both of which are associated with high firing costs, may be among
the culprits for the low degree of mobility in EMDEs (Mitra and Ranjan, 2011).

96.       While improving labor mobility is crucial, several factors complicate the design of
mitigating policies.

     Lower education: In 2010, average formal schooling of adults in EMDEs (7 years) remained well
      below that of advanced economies (11.3 years) (Barro-Lee Educational Attainment Dataset). Low
      education levels, coupled with generally weak education quality, can reduce the effectiveness of
      vocational training given the lack of more basic skills (Bassi and others, 2012; Silva, et al. 2015).

     Higher informality45: In addition to lowering the tax base and limiting available public funds for
      programs, a large informal sector brings challenges, as informal workers tend not to participate in
      mandatory contributory programs and workers may declare themselves to be actively searching for a
      job while working in the informal sector. To overcome this challenge, Vodopivec (2006) advocates
      relying on other income protection mechanisms, including self-insurance, rather than on
      unemployment insurance, in countries with large informal sectors and weak institutions. Acevedo,
      Eskenazi and Pages (2006) recommend the Chilean income support program, which combines social
      and self-insurance elements, and argue more generally that EMDEs should tailor different elements
      of social protection (severance pay, unemployment insurance savings accounts, public work
      programs, and social insurance) to their own characteristics.




45
   Goldberg and Pavcnik (2003) find that the trade liberalizations in Brazil and Colombia led to limited, if any,
expansion of the informal sector. The argument made here is not that trade leads to more informality , but that the

97.     Active Labor Market Policies in EMDEs have a poor track record and their funding
remains low.46 In a survey of randomized experiments to assess ALMPs in developing countries,
McKenzie (2017) finds that programs on vocational training, wage subsidies, and matching
assistance do not work well and calls for better targeted programs. In addition, spending on labor
market programs in developing countries is low. Four EMDEs included in OECD’s Labor Market
Programmes Database spend significantly less than the median OECD country. Covering nine Latin
American and Caribbean countries, Cerutti and others, (2014) report generally increasing but low
levels of spending on labor market programs as a share of GDP. While Brazil ranks highest among
these nine countries, its spending on labor market programs (0.8 percent of GDP, one quarter of
which was allocated to active programs) was well below the OECD average (Silva and others, 2015).

B. Experience in Denmark
Denmark does not have in place policies targeted to workers displaced due to trade or otherwise.
However, its “flexicurity” system serves all unemployed workers relatively well through generous
unemployment benefits coupled with strong activation policies.

98.    The Danish flexicurity labor market system is based on three pillars: (i) a flexible labor
market allowing employers to hire and fire relatively easily; (ii) a generous unemployment benefit



46
  A few labor market programs in EMDEs were targeted to trade related displacements but these were typically
sector specific and temporary (Hollweg and others, 2014).




52     INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
system; and (iii) strong activation policies incentivizing job search and enhancing workers’
employability.

99.       These three pillars are interconnected. The flexibility of the labor market implies a
high job turnover, making it important to have in place a strong unemployment insurance
scheme. In turn, the generosity of the unemployment insurance necessitates strong activation
policies, including strict job-search requirements and monitoring. To put this in perspective,
Denmark spends more on ALMPs than any other OECD country as a share of its GDP (Figure 12;
OECD, 2016b).

100.    Long advance notice periods create space for action even before actual dismissal
occurs. While employers are granted significant flexibility in hiring and firing decisions, they are
required to comply with long advance notice periods to the regional labor market council, which are
defined by legislation and/or collective agreements and increase with job tenure. This is key to
creating the necessary space for early action by the social partners and public authorities.

101.     The Danish system does not differentiate between displaced workers and workers
unemployed for other reasons. The first line of protection for displaced workers is unemployment
insurance if they are members of the unemployment insurance fund and qualify for benefits.
Otherwise, they may be entitled to family-based, means-tested basic social assistance subject to
income levels and value of assets, as all other unemployed workers. As for ALMPs, the Danish
profiling tool does not specifically target or identify displaced workers nor include inv oluntary job
loss as one of the criteria for program assignments. As such, there seems to be room for improving
the matching of workers to groups and services by introducing a scientific profiling tool (OECD,
2016b). Moreover, despite having several programs in place to augment worker skills (work-sharing,
job rotation, adult apprenticeship, practical work training and subsidized employment), it can be
challenging to ensure high take-up rates in small and medium-sized enterprises. This is particularly
true among workers who tend to need training more but are less likely to take it, especially older
and less- skilled workers. Accordingly, the OECD report’s recommendations include promoting the
take-up rate of publicly-subsidized, employer-provided training among workers who need it the
most.

102.    As trade policy is conducted at the E.U. level, trade specific programs are limited to
those funded by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Between 2009-14, the European
Globalization Adjustment Fund provided funding to seven selected Danish firms. These funds
totaled approximately 21 million euros (OECD, 2016b).

103.    Assessments of the flexicurity model are overall favorable. Using a randomized
experiment to evaluate ALMPs in Denmark, Vikström, Rosholm and Svarer (2011) find that ALMPs
reduce the unemployment spell significantly. While increased job search assistance, monitoring and
a threat effect all contribute to this result, frequent meetings with case workers were found to be the
most cost-effective. Consistently, Andersen and Svarer (2007) argue that the activation policies that
lead to a more intense job search, including through sanctions, made the system more effective.
However, several features of the system can impair the adjustment of displaced workers. For


                    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD BANK, AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 53
example, OECD (2016b) identifies that early intervention concentrates on large dismissals from large
firms, early notification periods are shorter for blue-collar than for white-collar workers, and a
substantial share of low-wage and low-skilled workers is not covered by unemployment insurance.

C.        United States—Policies to Mitigate Trade-Related Dislocations
Policies to mitigate trade-related adjustment costs in the United States include the targeted “Trade
Adjustment Assistance” program, and are complemented by broader social insurance and ALMPs.

104.    Import competition in manufacturing has had geographically concentrated effects.
These have been associated with substantial declines in overall employment and non-manufacturing
wages in certain communities and regions (Autor and others, 2013). Less-educated and older
workers, being less mobile, experienced larger income losses and were more likely to withdraw from
the labor force.

105.      The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program was introduced in 1962 to support and
compensate workers suffering trade-related job losses. Reforms in 2002 and 2009 have expanded
eligibility (e.g. to include the service sector and job losses from outsourcing), increased funding for
training (with the cap raised from $220 to $450 million), and added benefits. Currently, the program
has certified as eligible about 120,000 displaced workers, at a nominal annual cost of about
$800 million. It has a number of key features.

    Extended unemployment compensation provides workers up to 24 additional months of
     benefits, often conditional on using TAA-approved training and reemployment services. Roughly
     half of participants enroll in training services provided through local One-Stop Career Centers.47
    Job search/relocation assistance covers 90 percent of the associated costs up to $1250.
    Wage insurance provides reemployed workers, 50 years or older and earning under $50,000 a
     year, a wage supplement equivalent to half the difference between their previous and new wage,
     up to $10,000 a year, for up to two years. Some 5 percent of eligible participants have enrolled.
    Health insurance tax credit covers up to 72.5 percent of healthcare premiums.


106.    Unemployment insurance is the largest social insurance program, absorbing over three-
fourths of the budget for displaced workers (OECD, 2016a). It provides full-time, involuntarily
displaced workers who are actively seeking a job up to 26 weeks of benefits averaging half of past
earnings. Benefit duration has been extended during recessions; as it is also financed through state
payroll taxes, states have latitude in the design of the program. Historically, only 40 –50 percent of
displaced workers receive these benefits, and about 30 percent of beneficiaries exhaust them.




47 Accordi ng to Berk a nd others (2012), TAA participants were more likely to use reemployment and education/training
s ervi ces and as a result s witch i ndustries and occupations. However, their wages remained l ower up to four years following a
job l oss, especially for ol der workers.

107.     Other social insurance, namely retirement and disability insurance, are increasingly
being provided to trade-displaced workers that are eligible for retirement or disability.
Disability benefits, which vary according to past earnings, likely reflect anxiety-related illnesses
affecting displaced workers. Autor and others (2013) estimates that these social insurance transfers
comprised some 30 percent of total transfers to workers displaced by C hina’s import penetration
(Figure). The figure would be larger if disability-related health benefits to workers are included.

108.     Means-tested income support programs also provide assistance to displaced workers.
These include income support programs for workers and their families (e.g. Temporary Assistance to
Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income);
overall transfers are generally small and do not raise income above the poverty threshold.

109.    Other policies have limited coverage and funding (OECD 2016). Work-sharing schemes in
about half of the states provide income support to workers who experience reduced hours worked
or are temporarily laid off. Recent federal guidelines under the 2012 Layoff Prevention Act may
encourage participation and pertain to some 1 –2 percent of unemployment claims. Employment
protection legislation and early warning mechanisms tend to be fairly lenient and limited in scope
(e.g. advanced warning applies to firms with over 100 workers, where at least 50 workers are
affected). Federally-mandated programs to support employment of dislocated workers (e.g. Rapid
Response Service) do not currently provide the needed tailored assistance to dislocated workers.
