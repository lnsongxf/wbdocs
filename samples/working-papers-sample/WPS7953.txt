1     Introduction
What drives international trade? What hampers its growth? Academics and policy makers devote
a lot of attention to these questions. Multiple factors have been under the lens but typically
diﬀerent causes have been examined separately. In this paper, we investigate the role of ﬁnancial
and real sector elements on trade dynamics using ﬁrm-level data from 24 countries in the Eastern
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. We document the relative importance of adjustment at
the extensive (number of exporters) and intensive (quantity of exports) margins during the period
from 2002 to 2013. We then analyze the relative importance of credit as opposed to demand shocks
in the ﬁrm’s decision to export and the amount of exports in a formal econometric setting.
    We ﬁnd that demand shocks tend to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the decision to export as well as the
volumes exported. Conversely, credit constraints appear to play a more limited role. These results
tend to be robust to a wide range of speciﬁcations. However, there are diﬀerences in the relative
importance of these elements when we consider the type of export margin (extensive and intensive)
as well as the time period (before or after the crisis). Domestic demand shocks matter across all
speciﬁcations as they inﬂuence ﬁrms’ decision to export and the amount of exports. Conversely,
foreign demand shocks signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the intensive but not the extensive margin, and their
role becomes more pronounced when we distinguish between pre- and post-crisis periods. Finally,
credit constraints only play a role in the intensive margins and mainly when we do not take into
account the role of the ﬁnancial crisis. The ﬁrm’s subjective perception that ﬁnancial constraints
are a hurdle for business appears to matter more than the objective inability to secure a loan after
applying. The evidence is robust to controlling for possible endogeneity.
    The paper contributes to two branches in the literature examining the roles of ﬁnance and
demand shocks in international trade. The literature has mostly examined both roles separately
and ﬁnds that they are important to trade. Our paper will examine both roles together and ﬁnds
that demand shocks may be more important to international trade. The paper is closely related to
Nguyen and Qian (2014), that examines the roles of demand shocks and credit constraints on ﬁrms
in the ECA countries. Focusing only on the ﬁnancial crisis period (speciﬁcally 2009), the authors
show that demand shock is the main factor for a worsening in ﬁrm performance (sales, capacity,
and employment) is the decline in demand for the ﬁrm’s goods. They highlight the role demand
shocks play in the ﬁnancial crisis over credit constraints. Our paper extends this discussion by
examining the roles demand shocks and credit constraints have on ﬁrm export behavior and how
the relative importance of these roles changes over a longer time period that includes the ﬁnancial
crisis.
    Various studies document the importance of ﬁnance for international trade transactions: ﬁ-
nancial institutions not only provide trade ﬁnance through payment insurance and guarantees to
exporters, they are also key suppliers of services such as the evaluation of counterparty default risk.
Trade ﬁnance is a powerful catalyzer of international trade, Auboin (2009) estimates that about
90% of international trade transactions rely on some form of trade ﬁnance.
    The global ﬁnancial crisis has heightened the interest in the impact of credit crunches on trade.

                                                  2
The role of ﬁnance may have been magniﬁed since borrowing may become harder during times of
stress. Recent evidence suggests that the trade-ﬁnance nexus seems to be one explanation for the
trade contractions during both the Japanese slump and the recent U.S. ﬁnancial crisis. Amiti and
Weinstein (2011) show that during the Japanese crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the lack
of ﬁnancing accounted for nearly one-third of the plunge in exports. Similarly, using monthly U.S.
import data, Chor and Manova (2012) ﬁnd that countries with tighter credit availability during the
crisis exported less to the United States. Moreover, exports to the United States contracted more in
sectors that are more heavily dependent on external ﬁnancing. International evidence is in line with
the ﬁndings from the U.S. Paravisini, Rappoport, Schnabl, and Wolfenzon (2015) match Peruvian
customs and ﬁrm-level bank credit data to accurately measure the exogenous credit shocks, and
estimate that a 10% contraction in credit supply from poorly performing banks translates into a
2.3% fall in the export volumes.
   There is limited understanding of the channels through which credit constraints may aﬀect or
be aﬀected by export status. Several studies based on Melitz (2003) show that more productive
ﬁrms export as they can aﬀord the ﬁxed costs of exporting. But less attention has been dedicated to
the nature of the ﬁxed costs. Indeed many studies assume perfect capital markets and rule out the
existence of credit to ﬁnance either ﬁxed or variable costs. Two noteworthy exceptions are Chaney
(2016) and Manova (2013) that introduce ﬁrm-level liquidity into a trade model of heterogeneous
ﬁrms and link country-speciﬁc ﬁnancial development to export status. The logic underlying these
models is that in the presence of binding credit constraints, a high-productivity ﬁrm may still be
unable to ﬁnance export costs and operate internationally, but there may be low-productivity ﬁrms
that are ﬁnancially unconstrained and able to export. The relationship between productivity and
access to credit may alter the sharp prediction of the standard heterogeneous ﬁrms model so that
credit constraint may lower the (weighted) average productivity of the industry.
   A fundamental diﬀerence in these models is whether credit is used to ﬁnance the ﬁxed or variable
costs of exporting. Chaney (2016) conjectures that ﬁrms use the cash ﬂows from domestic sales to
ﬁnance the ﬁxed costs of entering foreign markets. More productive ﬁrms achieving higher proﬁts
are more likely to reinvest earnings. Once ﬁrms have enough liquidity to pay the ﬁxed cost of
exporting, they are able to ﬁnance the variable costs of expanding the scale of production with
internal funds or even by external borrowing. In contrast, Manova (2013) proposes a diﬀerent
framework to analyze the role of credit constraints, assuming that credit aﬀects exporting status
because also the variable production costs need to be ﬁnanced with external capital. In her model
of heterogeneous ﬁrms, industries diﬀer in their dependence on external ﬁnance and level of asset
tangibility. By exploiting the variation in the degree of ﬁnancial development across countries,
she uncovers evidence that credit constraints are a signiﬁcant determinant of international trade
patterns. She shows that ﬁrms in ﬁnancially-vulnerable sectors in ﬁnancially-developed countries
gain the most from the liberalization process. Once these ﬁrms become exporters, they start trading
greater volumes and at the same time export a wider variety of products.
   Alternative interpretations of the relationship among productivity, liquidity constraints, and


                                                 3
    export decisions have been suggested. Causality may run in the opposite direction, where ﬁrms
    overcome ﬁnancial constraints by diversifying their sales markets and choose to become exporters
    to overcome liquidity constraints.1 Trade policies may also play a role.2
        In parallel, a limited but growing literature on the role of demand shocks on trade ﬂows is
    developing. When faced with demand shocks, ﬁrms may seek to spread their sales between do-
    mestic and foreign markets to smooth their cash ﬂows. Indeed, Campa and Shaver (2002) suggest
    that Spanish manufacturing ﬁrms may decide to export to foreign markets to smooth their cash
    ﬂow and thus exploit the imperfect correlation between the destination country and the Spanish
    business cycles. Behrens, Corcos, and Mion (2013) use micro data to identify the fall in the de-
    mand for tradable goods as the main driver for trade decline in Belgium. More attenuated eﬀects
    are documented by Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis (2011) whose counterfactual analysis
    shows that non-durables demand shocks lead to 18% fall in world trade. Claessens, Tong, and
    Wei (2012) take a diﬀerent approach and study the impact of the crisis on cross-country balance
    sheets of non-ﬁnancial ﬁrms. They ﬁnd that the crisis hampered more ﬁrms with greater sensitivity
    to the business cycle and trade. Conversely, ﬁnancing openness (measured as total international
    assets plus liabilities over GDP) played a more limited role. The recent crisis has highlighted the
    signiﬁcant role of real sector shocks on trade dynamics, as suggested by Eaton, Kortum, Neiman,
    and Romalis (2011).
        The paper proceeds in three sections. We discuss the multiple data sources used in Section
    2. We then outline the empirical strategy and present the results in Subsection 3.1 and 3.2. We
    conclude in Section 4.


    2    Data
    We base our analysis on information from three main data sources. First, the Business Environment
    and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPSs) provide information about ﬁrms’ characteristics.
    Second, the World Development Indicators (WDI) and Global Development Finance (GDF) contain
    the macroeconomic variables to correct for inﬂation and exchange rate ﬂuctuations, and capture
    the macroeconomic conditions faced by ﬁrms. Third, the National Accounts Estimates of Main
    Aggregates and Trade Policy Information System (TPIS) data allow us to estimate demand shocks.
        The World Bank jointly with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development admin-
    istered the BEEP Surveys for four years (2002, 2005, 2009 and 2013) in 27 Eastern European and
    Central Asia countries.3 The ﬁrms interviewed were selected to form a representative sample of the

  In a study of Spanish manufacturing ﬁrms, Campa and Shaver (2002) suggest that ﬁrms may decide to export to
  foreign markets to smooth their cash ﬂow and thus exploit the imperfect correlation between the destination country
  and the Spanish business cycles.

  Pavcnik (2002) concludes that Chilean manufacturing plants in import-competing sectors underwent large productiv-
  ity improvements during the massive trade liberalization of the late 1970s. Similarly, examining a period of signiﬁcant
  changes in Colombian trade policy across industries between 1977 and 1991, Fernandes (2007) ﬁnds that tariﬀ liber-
  alization boosts plant productivity and the eﬀect appears to be particularly strong if the ﬁrm is larger and operating
  in a less competitive industry.

  Speciﬁcally the surveys are ﬁelded in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croa-

 population of non-agricultural ﬁrms within each country.4 The BEEPSs contain both qualitative
 and quantitative information about the ﬁrms and the business environment where they operate. We
 exploit the sections of the surveys that focus on the business perceptions about the most relevant
 obstacles to investment, the relative importance of diﬀerent constraints to boosting employment
 and productivity, and the eﬀects of the country-speciﬁc environment on ﬁrms’ international com-
 petitiveness.
     To ensure comparability across countries and over time, we convert in US dollar at constant
 prices the values of the variables of interest from the BEEPS expressed in local currencies. The
 WDI and GDF provide exchange rate time series and estimates of the GDP deﬂator used to convert
 the nominal time series in real terms. The use of the GDP deﬂator implies that the inﬂation rate
 has been constant across sectors in a given country and during a speciﬁc year. The use of sector-
 speciﬁc price indexes for each ISIC sector would be preferable but these series are not available for
 the countries we study. We account for country-speciﬁc factors such as general economic conditions
 with GDP (constant 2000 US$), likelihood to obtain credit with the number of commercial bank
 branches (per 100,000 adults), domestic credit provided by banking sector (% of GDP), and the
 extra-cost of borrowing (lending rate minus deposit rate, %).
     The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) manages the National Accounts Estimates of
 Main Aggregates that report the gross value added at constant prices (in USD) by country and
 sector for all the years and countries in the BEEPS. The TPIS data set reports bilateral export
 volumes and we can then estimate the demand shocks based on the strategy proposed by Coulibaly,
 Sapriza, and Zlate (2012). The authors construct an index of demand as a function of the ﬁrms’
 exports-to-sales ratio, the sector-speciﬁc exposure to various foreign destinations, and real GDP
 growth across destinations as a proxy for the change in demand. We provide details regarding the
 construction of these indices in Section 3.1.


 3     Empirical Analysis
 Firms in our sample constitute a representative sample of non-agricultural ﬁrms in 27 ECA coun-
 tries. On average, they have been operative for 15 years and are middle-sized with less than 100
 employees (Table 1). They tend to be liquidity constrained based on both the subjective and ob-
 jective measures, and operate in a relatively volatile macroeconomic environment as indicated by
 the fact that domestic GDP ﬂuctuates from −4.5% up to +25%. Only 26% of the ﬁrms in the
 sample export to foreign markets, and they tend to make relatively small shares of their total sales
 abroad (11%).
     The panel nature of the data also provides important insights from the cross-country and time
 variations. For example, in Kazakhstan ﬁrms’ exports amount to only 3% of total sales, while in
  tia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYRM), Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan,
  Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovak Republic,
  Turkey and Ukraine.
4
  In the 2002 and 2005, the sample is self-weighted, while in 2009 and 2013 ﬁrms are sampled randomly with replacement
  according to sector of activity, ﬁrm size, and geographical location strata.

    Slovenia they account for 22%. In order to explore these diﬀerences, in Figure 1 we plot the changes
    in the extensive and intensive margins of exports within each country during the 2002-2013 period.
    On the y-axis we plot the changes from 2002 and 2009, while on the x-axis we plot the changes
    between 2009 and 2013. Observing scatter dots concentrated in the ﬁrst (third) quadrants is a sign
    of a boom (bust) in exports that continued during the entire sample period. Conversely, scatter
    dots in the second (fourth) quarter indicate that exports fell (rose) in 2013-2009 after an initial
    increase (decline) in 2002-2009. We ﬁnd that many ECA countries are in the fourth quadrant: there
    was a decline in the extensive (share of exporters) and intensive (share of exports) components of
    the changes in trade in 2002-2009, and an increase in 2009-2013. During the period 2002-2009,
    the share of exporting ﬁrms and exports declinedby almost 15% and 30% respectively across most
    ECA countries. Macedonia, FYR experienced the largest fall in the share of exports and in the
    number of exporters. Some of these countries increased the intensive and extensive margins in
    2009-2013. Conversely, the share of exporters and exports in Turkey increased over both periods,
    and substantially during the second period.

    3.1    Empirical methodology
    We test the relative importance of demand shocks and credit constraints of ﬁrm i in country j at
    time t on the ability to export (extensive margin) in Equation 1 and the relative extent of exports
    (intensive margin) in Equation 2 by estimating the following equations:

               P rob(Exportijt > 0) = αCreditConstraintijt + βDomesticDemandShockjt
                                               +γF oreignDemandShock−jt + δXijt +                ijt                   (1)
                             Exportijt = αCreditConstraintit + βDomesticDemandShockjt
                                               +γF oreignDemandShock−jt + δXijt + υijt                                 (2)

        The dependent variables (P rob(Exportijt > 0) and Exportijt ) are constructed from the BEEPS
    survey question: “What percentage of your ﬁrm’s sales are sold domestically, exported directly, or
    indirectly through a distributor?” Firms that report a positive value for either direct or indirect
    exports are identiﬁed as exporters, with the dummy variable P rob(Exportijt > 0) taking a value
    of one. The sum of direct and indirect exports yields the value of total export as a percentage of
    total sales used to estimate Equation 2. For robustness checks, we use alternative deﬁnitions of
    the dependent variables. First we consider excluding exports sold indirectly through a distributor.
    Second, we measure the dependent variable in Equation 2 as the total value of exports, allowing
    for a distinction between small and large ﬁrms.5
        There is an objective and a subjective measure of the variable CreditConstraintijt . The sub-
5
    Total value of exports is not directly recorded in the BEEPs survey. It is calculated by multiplying the share of
    exports in total sales and the value of total sales. While export value is a preferable dependent variable to the share
    of exports in total sales, there are inconsistencies in the way total sales are recorded across the countries and time
    periods. We cannot dismiss the potentially considerable measurement error and related bias. Hence, we use this
    measure only for robustness checks.


                                                              6
    jective measure is based on the self-reported diﬃculty of ﬁnancing for the operation and growth of
    the business. In 2002 and 2005 respondents are separately asked to assess the degree of diﬃculty
    in access to (“e.g., collateral required or ﬁnancing not available from banks”) and cost of ﬁnancing
    (“e.g., interest rates and charges”), ranging from 1 (“No obstacle”) to 4 (“Major obstacle”). In 2009
    and 2013, these two questions are merged into one and respondents are asked about the concerns
    due to access to ﬁnancing. Also the scale of the importance of the constraint is diﬀerent and varies
    from 1 (“No obstacle”) to 5 (“Very severe obstacle”). We harmonize the scales across years and
    construct the variable as follows:
                                
                                
                                
                                  1,     if the access to and the cost of ﬁnancing are not an obstacle;
                                
                                 2,      if either the access to or the cost of ﬁnancing are a minor obstacle;
       CreditConstraintijt =
                                
                                
                                  3,     if either the access to or the cost of ﬁnancing are a moderate obstacle;
                                
                                 4,
                                   if both access and cost of ﬁnancing are a major obstacle.
       The subjective measure of CreditConstraint may raise questions about consistency as it is
    self-reported and suﬀers from individual bias. We thus compare the subjective measure with an
    objective ﬁrm-level indicator. A ﬁrm is objectively deemed credit unconstrained if one the following
    conditions applies: (1) it did not apply for a line of credit or loan because it “did not need a loan,
    the establishment has suﬃcient capital”, or (2) it applied for any new loans or new lines of credit
    and was not rejected.6
       The subjective and objective measures of being capital constrained are signiﬁcantly correlated.
    This evidence is consistent with Hallward-Driemeier and Aterido (2009) and Gorodnichenko and
    Schnitzer (2010) that relate subjective ﬁnancing constraints to the amount of credit issued to the
    private sector, expressed as a percentage of GDP.
       However, the objective measure of credit constraint may suﬀer from endogeneity bias. Firms
    may be credit unconstrained because banks extend them credit (supply-side channel) or because
    they do not demand credit as demand falls (demand-side channel). To disentangle these two chan-
    nels we propose two instruments for the objective measure: the share of domestic credit provided
    by the banking sector (as a percentage of GDP), and the share of foreign banks out of the total
    number of banks in each country at time t and t − 1. Both instruments capture the health of the
    ﬁnancial market and are correlated to whether or not a ﬁrm may receive credit but exogenous to
    the ﬁrm’s export decisions.
       Credit constraints may have an important impact on ﬁrm exports in ECA countries, especially
    given the large presence of foreign banks in the region. Based on data from Claessens and van
    Horen (2012), Figure 2 shows that the ECA region stands out in terms of presence of foreign
    banks. As European banks are the largest sources of FDI in the banking sector of ECA countries,
    this initial wave of transmission of credit shocks produced immediate eﬀects on the credit markets
    of the countries we study.7 There is indeed growing evidence that banks transmit credit shocks
6
  Alternative possible answers to question (1) are “Application procedures for loans or lines of credit are complex”,
  “Interest rates are not favorable”, “Collateral requirements are too high”, “Size of loan and maturity are insuﬃcient”,
  “It is necessary to make informal payments to get bank loans”, “Did not think it would be approved”.
7
  Giannetti and Laeven (2012) show that the collapse of the global market for syndicated loans during ﬁnancial crisis
  can in part be explained by a ﬂight home eﬀect whereby lenders rebalance their loan portfolios in favor of domestic


                                                            7
 internationally, quickly and powerfully, and in particular that the volatility of foreign lending is
 higher than that of domestic lending. Lending by bank subsidiaries appears to be more procyclical
 and “crunched” during the recent crisis.8 More relevant for this study is the evidence from Popov
 and Udell (2012). Focusing on the Eastern European countries in our data set, these authors show
 that ﬁrms were more credit constrained if they were dealing with banks that experienced a decline
 in equity and Tier 1 capital, as well as losses on ﬁnancial assets. Riskier ﬁrms as well as ﬁrms with
 fewer tangible assets were more aﬀected by positive or negative shocks suﬀered by banks.
     We account for both foreign and domestic shocks to demand, DomesticDemandShockjt and
 F oreignDemandShock−jt , in our estimation framework. Following Coulibaly, Sapriza, and Zlate
 (2012), foreign demand shocks are captured as the percentage change in GDP in the destination
 country weighted by the shares of the exports from country of ﬁrm i at time t − 1 to each des-
 tination country.9 Domestic demand shocks are computed as the percentage change in domestic
 GDP, consistent with the measure of foreign demand shocks. We also use the ﬁrm-speciﬁc level
 of utilization of facilities and manpower (“capacity”) as alternative measures of demand shocks
 for robustness checks. The measures are not included in the baseline regressions as they are not
 available for all time periods: less than 40% of the ﬁrms reported their capacity level in the last
 two rounds of the surveys.
     The vector Xijt contains the additional ﬁrm-level characteristics accounting for the heterogene-
                                                                                            ` la
 ity among ﬁrms. Because of data limitations, we cannot calculate total factor productivity a
 Olley and Pakes (1996), but deﬁne the labor productivity as the log of the ratio of total sales to
 employment, a widely used alternative in the trade literature. Even though basic, this proxy is
 preferable to more elaborate measures of productivity in the absence of input or output prices, as
 in our case. We account for the age of the ﬁrm, computed as the diﬀerence between the time of
 the survey and the year the ﬁrm began operating in a given country. We also control for the size
 of the ﬁrm, including a binary variable that takes value one if the ﬁrm has more than one but less
 than 19 employees. Industry ﬁxed eﬀects are also added: the ﬁrms in the sample belong to the real
 estate (8%), manufacturing (27%), construction (13%), retail (40%), hotel and restaurant (5%),
 and transportation (8%) industries.
     The estimation of Equation 1 will be done through a linear probability model (LPM). While
 the LPM tends to generate biased and inconsistent estimates, as discussed in Horrace and Oaxaca
 (2006), it is not a large concern given the structure of our data. Irrespective of the set of covariates


  borrowers with the home bias of lenders’ loan origination increasing by approximately 20% if the bank’s home
  country experiences a banking crisis. The larger contraction in lending during the ﬁnancial crisis by foreign-owned
  banks relative to locally-funded domestic banks is documented also by Ongena, Peydr´    o, and Van Horen (2015) that
  focus speciﬁcally on countries from the ECA region and Turkey.

  For example, using U.S. data from the recent ﬁnancial crisis, Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012) show that foreign banks
  pulled signiﬁcant funding from their U.S. branches during the Great Recession with sizable eﬀects on their U.S.
  lending. They estimate that the average-sized branch experienced a 12% net internal fund withdrawal and that, on
  average, for each dollar of funds transferred internally to the parent, branches decreased lending supply by about 40
  to 50 cents. Similar ﬁndings are also documented in Coulibaly, Sapriza, and Zlate (2012).

  The BEEPS data do not track the ﬁrm-speciﬁc export destinations. We use aggregate trade data from the World
  Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) database.

     used, at least 96% of predicted probabilities lie between 0 and 1, indicating that the estimates for
     only less than 4% of the sample may be biased or inconsistent.10 Even if one focuses on this 4%
     of observations, Wooldridge (2010) notes that “[...] if the main purpose is to estimate the partial
     eﬀect of [the independent variable] on the response probability, averaged across the distribution of
     [the independent variable], then the fact that some predicted values are outside the unit interval
     may not be very important.” The computational tractability of the LPM also leads us to favor it
     over the nonlinear alternatives. The alternative of relying on Probit models would lead to biased
     estimates when including ﬁxed eﬀects because of incidental parameter problems (Greene (2004)).
     The beneﬁts of accounting for industry and year ﬁxed eﬀects outweigh the costs of relying on LPM,
     in our view.
         Our sample includes periods prior, during and after the recent global crisis, covering the span
     between the 2002 and 2013 surveys. We explore whether the role of demand and credit constraints
     evolved over time interacting the main demand and credit shocks with time dummies. The dummy
     Crisis? takes value one for the years from 2009 to 2013.

     3.2     Results
     We test the role and relative importance of demand and credit constraints on the extensive (Equa-
     tion 1) and intensive (Equation 2) margins of exports. We ﬁrst conduct the analysis on the full
     sample and then focus on the crisis period in order to assess the robustness of the results to a
     period of stress.
         We ﬁnd the usual predictions for export participation of ﬁrms: larger, more productive and
     (at least partially) foreign-owned ﬁrms are more likely to become exporters (Table 2). Negative
     domestic demand shocks can signiﬁcantly increase the probability to export. Controlling for the
     heterogeneity in ﬁrm characteristics that can aﬀect the ﬁrm’s ability to pay for the costs of ex-
     porting, a 1% decrease in domestic GDP increases the likelihood of selling abroad by about 0.5%.
     Production capacity is diﬃcult to change in the short run and when local demand drops, ﬁrms are
     likely to look for alternative markets to sell their products to remain proﬁtable. Thus, as the do-
     mestic economy worsens, ﬁrms branch out of their national borders in search of potential markets.
     The importance of domestic demand shocks is unaﬀected by the crisis (Table 3). The results hold
     also after controlling for the ﬁrm-speciﬁc level of utilization of facilities and manpower (Table A.1,
     A.2).
         On the other hand, foreign demand shocks play a more limited role when we consider the full
     sample. This result suggests that there are other factors that are inﬂuencing the choice of export
     market besides the demand at the destination country.11 However, when we examine the role of
     foreign shocks before and after the crisis, they are responsible for as much as 1.8% increase in the
     probability to export during the non-crisis period. Credit constraints do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
10
     Values outside of this range vary at most from -0.04 to 1.08, considering all predicted probabilities across models.
11
     One factor may be the role of business and social networks in providing information and contacts in the destination
     market. Firms are more likely to export to markets where they have common links or relationship (Rauch (2001),
     Combes, Lafourcade, and Mayer (2005) and Chaney (2014)).


                                                              9
     the choice to export (Tables 2 and 3). The results are robust to the use of both the subjective and
     objective measures of credit constraint and estimating directly or indirectly through instrumental
     variables. Restricting the focus only to those ﬁrms that export directly leads to qualitatively similar
     results.
        Next, we explore the respective role and importance of demand and ﬁnancial shocks on the
     intensive margin measured by the share of exports in total sales (Table 4). Factors that play a
     marginal role in the decision to export, such as credit constraints and foreign demand shocks, take
     the center stage in determining the amount a ﬁrm exports. An increase in credit constraints will
     decrease the ﬁrm’s share of exports in total sales, while an increase in foreign shock will increase
     the share of exports. The results in Table 4 indicate that the subjective ﬁnancial constraints have
     the largest impact on a ﬁrm’s exports. A one standard deviation reduction in subjective credit
     constraints corresponds to a 0.13 standard deviation increase in share of sales exported. Similar
     reductions in objective credit constraints and domestic demand shocks correspond to a 0.09 and
     0.01 standard deviation raise in the share exports respectively.12 The negative relationship between
     domestic demand shocks and the share of exports in the ﬁrm’s sales suggests that ﬁrms substitute
     between local and foreign sales as their production capacities are ﬁxed. Ceteris paribus as local
     demand conditions improve, the amount of exports decreases. Interestingly, the role of credit
     constraints becomes marginal when we distinguish between the crisis and pre-crisis period (Table
     5). Similar ﬁndings emerge when we account for the level of capacity exploited (Table A.3, A.4).13
     In all these cases, irrespective of speciﬁcation chosen (foreign or domestic) demand shocks matter
     and appear with the expected sign. A positive shock abroad or a negative one at home increases
     the share of sales sold outside of the national borders.
        We plot the average marginal eﬀects of credit constraints and demand shocks for easier com-
     parison across them in Figures 3 and 4. The vertical line represents the y-axis passing through
     the origin, while the horizontal lines indicate the 95% conﬁdence interval around each coeﬃcient
     capture by the dot. Demand shocks play a signiﬁcant role in determining how much a ﬁrm exports,
     with foreign shocks playing a more prominent role. Interestingly, the perception to be ﬁnancially
     constraints reduces less the volume of exports during the crisis, when access to ﬁnance is likely to
     be tighter.
        Finally, we test the robustness of the results by controlling for possible sample selection bias
     (Table 6). The lack of signiﬁcance of the inverse Mill’s ratio (IMR) points to the lack of selection
     bias. The IMR is obtained assuming that (i) customs and trade regulations, (ii) labor regulations,
     or (iii) transportation as the main obstacle to business, or (iv) being (at least partially) foreign
     owned aﬀects the probability of being an exporter, but not the share of exports in total sales.

   The p-values of the Endogeneity test indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that “Unable to obtain a
   loan?” can be treated as exogenous.
13
   We obtain similar ﬁndings using the ﬁrm’s share of sales directly exported. The results are available upon request
   from the authors.

4    Conclusions
Both demand shocks and credit constraints can aﬀect the extensive and intensive margins of ex-
ports. Demand shocks are important for both margins, but it depends on the source of the shocks.
Domestic demand shocks are important for both the ﬁrm’s export participation and the share
of exports in the ﬁrm’s sales. Foreign demand shocks are only relevant for the intensive margin
and become more prominent when we distinguish between crisis and non-crisis periods. Similarly,
credit constraints are only relevant for the intensive margin but only when we do not account for
the ﬁnancial crisis.
    The results suggest the relative importance of demand shocks over credit constraints for ex-
porting ﬁrms, which remains over the ﬁnancial crisis period. They conﬁrm the ﬁndings in Nguyen
and Qian (2014), where demand shocks are the main factor for poor ﬁrm performance over the
ﬁnancial crisis, and show that these results apply also to a period of no ﬁnancial stress. Finally,
before concluding, two points are worth highlighting. First, the evidence does not imply that credit
constraints are not important for exports, but that they play a less prominent role compared to
demand shocks. Second, the results presented are based on the evidence from countries in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia. The (relative) importance of demand and credit shocks may be diﬀerent
in other developing countries that may suﬀer more acutely from underdeveloped ﬁnancial markets.

The dependent variable is the Share(ExportedSalesit ). Robust standard errors are reported in brackets. The
symbols ***,**,* represent signiﬁcance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level. Under the null hypothesis of the
Kleibergen-Paap LM test, the structural equation is underidentiﬁed, that is instruments are not relevant. Under the
null hypothesis of the Hansen J test, the instruments are valid. The null of the endogeneity test is that the
endogenous regressor(s) can be treated as exogenous.
