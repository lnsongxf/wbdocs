Policy Goals for Independent Private Schools                                                                                  Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    Schools have legal authority to set teacher standards, to appoint and dismiss teachers, and to determine teacher
    salary levels without final review from central authorities. Schools also have the legal authority over how the
    curriculum is delivered. However, central government has the legal authority over how resources are allocated to the
    classroom.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    The government does not set standards on what students need to learn and by when. Standardized exams are
    administered annually and results are disaggregated. Government does not require schools to undergo an inspection.
    Sanctions are not administered based on the results of school inspections or performance on standardized exams.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Ad hoc information is provided to parents on standardized exam results or inspection reports. The government does
    not provide tax subsidies or cash transfers for families attending private schools.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    Schools set fees without any review from government. The government allows all of the following school types to
    operate: community, not-for-profit, faith-based, for-profit. Operating standards are the same as public school
    certification standards. Registration/certification guidelines are not made public and are only available on request.

 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    Schools have the legal authority to set teacher standards, to dismiss teachers, to determine teacher salary levels, to
    manage school operating budgets, and determine how the curriculum is delivered without final review from central
    authorities. However, the central government has the legal authority to appoint teachers and determine classroom
    resources allocation.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    The government sets standards on what students need to learn and by when. Standardized exams are administered
    annually and results are disaggregated. Government does not require schools to report on the use of public funds as a
    condition for the continuation of funding. Schools are required to undergo an inspection but no standard term is
    specified. Inspection reports include a school’s strengths and weaknesses and specific priorities for improvement.
    Sanctions are not administered.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    Ad hoc information is provided to parents on standardized exam results or inspection reports. Neither students nor
    parents are interviewed as part of an inspection process. Schools are allowed to select students based on academic
    performance. Parental choice is restricted by compulsory monetary parent contributions.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    The government allows for all types of providers to operate a school. Operating standards are the same as public
    school certification standards. Registration/certification guidelines are only available on request. Academic operating
    budgets are equivalent to per-student amounts in public schools. Schools do not receive initial funding to open.

SABER-EPS recognizes that the four policy goals outlined
in box 1 can assist governments in raising accountability
for the education services provided in their countries.
The tool allows governments to systematically evaluate
their policies and implement practices that are effective
across multiple country contexts.

Four types of private provision of education
Across the world, governments can implement
numerous strategies to improve educational outcomes
by supporting non-state education provision. SABER-EPS
benchmarks key policy goals across the four most
common models of private service delivery:
     1. Independent private schools: schools that are
        owned and operated by non-government
        providers and are financed privately, typically
        through fees.
     2. Government-funded private schools: schools
        that are owned and operated by non-
        government providers, but receive government
        funding.
     3. Privately managed schools: schools that are
        owned and financed by the government, but
        are operated by non-government providers.
     4. Voucher schools: schools that students choose
        to attend with government-provided funding;

The overall score for each policy goal is computed by
aggregating the scores for each of its constituent
indicators. For example, a hypothetical country receives
the following indicator scores for one of its policy goals:

         Indicator B = 3 points
         Indicator C = 4 points

      The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
      initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
      systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
      associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
      with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
      teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
      accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
      their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
      all children and youth learn.

      This report focuses specifically on policies of engaging the private
      sector in education.
