Management Action Update
The Management Action Record (MAR)
tracks the actions of the Management of the
World Bank Group institutions in response
to IEG recommendations in corporate,
sector, and thematic evaluations. The MAR
tracks only recommendations that IEG and
management agree or partially agree on.
Management creates an action plan for the
accepted recommendations, and the World
Bank Group and IEG assess the
implementation of each recommendation
for four years, after which a
recommendation is retired from the MAR.

IEG and the World Bank Group tracked
actions for 150 recommendations across all
three World Bank Group institutions in
2016, drawn from the 26 evaluations
produced between FY12 and FY15. About
32 percent of the IEG recommendations
active in this year’s update focus on capacity
building, 28 percent on M&E, and 18
percent on the World Bank Group’s
strategic directions and approaches. For
evaluations in the fourth year of review,

Management Comments
The management of the World Bank Group institutions welcomes the report of the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), Results and Performance of the World Bank
Group 2016 (RAP), and the opportunity to respond with comments. The report
presents useful analysis and insights on the World Bank Group’s status and
progress in three areas: (i) the institution’s approach to and success with integrating
the key principles of managing for results (M4R); (ii) the recent performance of
World Bank Group operations; and (iii) the implementation status of the
Management Action Record (MAR). Management is pleased that the report
recognizes recent positive trends, and it notes the challenges in the results and
performance of World Bank Group operations that the report highlights.

Management finds that this year’s thematic focus, M4R, is timely and relevant in the
context of the rollout of the new Forward Look and the record commitment made for
the 18th Replenishment of the International Development Association as the global
development community works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs).

World Bank Management Comments
MANAGING FOR RESULTS

Management appreciates the report’s recognition that the World Bank Group’s past
efforts have “clearly led to positive changes” in managing for and reporting on
development results, and that the institution is considered to be “at the forefront” in
emphasizing the importance of M4R. Management also appreciates the effort made
in the report to document some of initiatives the World Bank Group has taken and
its achievements in integrating the key principles of M4R in its operations. At the
same time, management acknowledges that there is a need to continue efforts to
strengthen M4R within the World Bank, especially evidence-based adaptive
management and learning, as well as to enhance client capacity for M4R, including
in the areas of data availability at the country level and the use of evidence for policy
making. The following paragraphs provide some specific comments on each aspect
of M4R analyzed in the report.

Measuring Development Results. The report finds that the World Bank has made
important progress in measuring development results by improving structures and
systems for measurement and placing greater emphasis on gathering data on results.
Management recognizes the need to continue focusing on the overall quality of


                                                                                      xiv
                                                                   MANAGEMENT COMMENTS


results frameworks, in particular to strengthen how outcomes are measured.
Management fully agrees with the report’s view that the development results of
operations or country strategies should be outcomes rather than outputs. At the
same time, management believes that there are multiple levels of outcomes within a
results chain, and that World Bank-financed operations (and country strategies)
need to target the levels of outcomes that are realistic and reasonably attributable to
the interventions, given their duration, resources, and context. While it would be
ideal to measure outcomes as changes at the ultimate beneficiary level (individuals,
households, and firms, as cited in the report), this may not always be feasible or
appropriate for every project or intervention.

For instance, support for decentralization of service delivery might begin with an
operation that focuses on setting up local government structures, personnel, and
systems, and putting in place a mechanism for fiscal transfers. In countries with
weak capacity, particularly in fragile or post-conflict situations, this activity alone
might take the lifetime of the project to accomplish. To hold this project accountable
for improved services or welfare at the individual or household level might be more
than the project could be reasonably expected to achieve, and a more appropriate
outcome indicator might be the impact on local government capacity (e.g.,
functioning local government structures with qualified personnel; functioning
systems for planning, budgeting, and funds flow). In stronger countries, a similar
project might be able to achieve improved services or greater well-being of ultimate
beneficiaries within the lifetime of the project, and for such countries,
individual/household access to quality services might be the right outcome
indicators. Management has discussed this topic with IEG on various occasions, and
is eager to continue to work with IEG and to provide better guidance to task teams
on setting outcome targets at the appropriate levels.

Related to this point, the report notes “managing for results requires some expected
level of verifiable contribution.” It is important to recognize that outcomes at the
highest levels in the results chain (e.g., reduced poverty, increased incomes, reduced
mortality, lowered unemployment) are the ones that are least attributable to specific
project interventions, as they are usually influenced by myriad factors. The further
up the results chain the outcomes are, the harder it becomes to show a “verifiable”
contribution of the project to them. This measurement challenge is exacerbated by
the fact that there may be a time lag in achieving higher-level outcomes (e.g.,
incomes might increase a few years after a road has been completed). Thus, it is
important to set outcomes at levels that are reasonably attributable, verifiable, and
feasible given the duration, resources, and approach of the intervention. It is also
important, as the report pointed out, to analyze diverse factors that might have
affected the project outcomes, and to enhance projects’ monitoring and evaluation


                                                                                     xv

(M&E) design to assess projects’ efficacy. The World Bank has several efforts under
way to support teams in thinking through results chains, outcomes, and issues of
attribution versus contribution more carefully from the design through the
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) stage (including the ICR
Reform and Agile Pilots).

Adaptive Management and Learning to Achieve Results. Management
acknowledges that more work needs to be done on incorporating lessons and
evidence into project design, making course corrections during implementation, and
encouraging innovation and risk-taking. Over the years, the World Bank has
introduced a number of initiatives to promote adaptive learning, including
adaptable program lending instruments (Adaptable Program Loans and Learning
and Innovation Loans), Additional Financing, and simplified processes for project
restructuring. While some progress has been made on flexibility, management
recognizes the need for further work on more effectively closing feedback loops and
adopting more evidence-based approaches.

With regard to adaptive management at the corporate level, the report suggests that
the Corporate Scorecard (CSC), specifically the Tier II indicators, should be used
more extensively to provide strategic direction to management. Tier II of the CSC is
intended to provide a snapshot of the kinds of results the World Bank has achieved
at a specific point in time. The indicators were selected to reflect a balance across
different sector or thematic areas as well as the feasibility of aggregating across
projects. Thus, most indicators are output-oriented, and they capture results in a
limited number of areas and sectors. It would therefore be misleading to use the
CSC’s Tier II results as a tool for adaptive management to set strategic directions for
the World Bank, at either the corporate or the sectoral level.

Supporting Client M4R Capacity. Management appreciates the report’s exploratory
analysis of the World Bank’s support for M4R capacity. The report documents the
products and instruments the World Bank is using to support M4R capacity in client
countries and provides a useful benchmark to monitor efforts going forward. This is
a critical area that needs continued attention and effort. At the same time, the
challenges of supporting client capacity in M4R cannot be underestimated, as
investment in M4R approaches, such as data systems or results-based budgeting and
financing, will require sustained effort and resources and are heavily dependent on
the client’s political will and prioritization of the use of scarce resources.

RECENT RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF WORLD BANK OPERATIONS

Project Performance. Management is pleased to see an overall upward trend in
project performance in terms of IEG’s outcome ratings and a similar trend in ratings
of Bank performance. While outcome ratings by volume have exceeded targets,
management recognizes the need to continue to strengthen results at the individual
project level.

Country-Level Performance. Management appreciates the detailed analysis of
country development outcomes, including the regression analysis showing the
positive correlation of country development outcomes with the Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and with portfolio outcome ratings. At the same
time, management acknowledges that the results frameworks and realism of country
strategies need to be further strengthened, and takes note of the report’s suggestion
that the performance and learning reviews of country partnership frameworks
(CPFs) could be used more deliberately to review results chains and CPF outcomes.

MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD

Management appreciates the analysis of the MAR process and implementation
progress. Management notes that about a third of the recommendations adopted
since 2008 had an M4R dimension, and that progress has been slow in implementing
recommendations related particularly to capacity building and M&E. Management
acknowledges the critical role of capacity building and M&E on development results
and will continue strengthening efforts to address these issues.

The MAR reform of 2011 established a clear and transparent mechanism to follow
up on IEG’s recommendations, and the MAR has become an important
accountability tool. After more than five years of implementation, management feels
that a review of the MAR process and implementation experience may be warranted
to improve its effectiveness and to make it more adaptable to changing
circumstances. In that context, management is looking forward to carrying out the
pilots that have been agreed following the IEG External Review. Going forward,
management would like to take stock of the lessons from the pilots and assess the
effectiveness of the MAR process in influencing positive change in the World Bank
Group.

IFC Management Comments

Group Results and Performance 2016. It commends IEG for highlighting the theme of
M4R as this edition’s focus given the increased attention to development results by

the International Finance Corporation (IFC), including through the new Economics
and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency. IFC management and staff
appreciate the IEG team’s effort to understand the facts and viewpoints that IFC
shared, and to incorporate them where possible.

Importance of Quality Results Measurement Frameworks. IFC management fully
agrees with the importance of having quality results measurement frameworks for
effective, evidence-based adaptive management and learning, which would
ultimately lead to strong results and impact. Management is therefore pleased with
the recognition that the World Bank Group has made good progress on creating a
structure and process for results measurement, and that it has carried out reforms
and several initiatives to enhance evidence-based management and learning. IFC’s
efforts for M4R have come a long way since the establishment of OEU (the first IFC
evaluation unit and part of today’s IEG) in 1987, the implementation of Expanded
Project Supervision Reports (XPSRs) in 1994 and the Development Outcome
Tracking System (DOTS) in 2005. IFC’s current Results, Monitoring, and Evaluation
system is considered as best practice among private sector oriented development
finance institutions. The framework, approved and monitored by the Committee on
Development Effectiveness since 2014, aims to strike the complex balance between
quality, practicality, and reality. Under the leadership of the new Vice President,
Economics and Private Sector Development, IFC is further strengthening its results
framework, particularly with respect to ex-ante analyses. In this regard,
management takes note of the IEG concern that the World Bank Group needs a
stronger, more systematic, and holistic push to build a foundation and culture for
evidence-based adaptive management and learning.

Beneficiary-Level Results. Verifiable, auditable data that are, systematically
available at the beneficiary level have been the standard that both IFC and IEG use
for evaluation and validation. As the report notes, DOTS data benefit from an
external assurance provider. With respect to the suggestion that repeat clients could
be a starting point to explore a new approach that would aim to capture
incremental, verifiable, and auditable stakeholder and beneficiary results more
systematically, management appreciates the suggestion and would like to explore
while keeping realistic parameters in place.

Adaptive Management. As the report states, IFC continues to focus on adaptive
learning and management. IFC has over 40 lesson databases, including one
mentioned in the report (LessonFinder, managed by IEG). IFC’s Global Knowledge
and Learning Office is consolidating them for more effective and efficient staff
access. In addition, IFC has mainstreamed corporate programs to promote learning,
especially since the 2014 survey undertaken by IEG. These programs, include:

Knowbel Award, the annual Knovember Lessons Sharing event, SmartLessons, and
technical master classes. These are complemented by other ongoing efforts, such as
the design of a new lessons’ framework and the mainstreaming of after-action
reviews to capture project lessons and recommendations for improvements. In
addition to Special Operations, all investment departments and some corporate
departments, such as the Credit Department and the Environment, Social, and
Governance Department, organize annual Knowledge and Learning weeks with a
focus on sharing lessons learned. Many IFC departments have knowledge
management staff dedicated to such lessons activities as MAS Talks, FIG Knowledge
Bytes, and Infra PostVivems—all of these are described in the IEG–IFC joint internal
report “Lessons in IFC” issued last year.

Volume Targets. The report notes that according to an FY16 survey, IFC staff
considered volume targets and project profitability to be the most important metrics
for management. Management believes that this finding mirrors two of our business
priorities but does not necessarily preclude other priorities, such as development
impact and client satisfaction. In addition, while volume targets remain critical, IFC
is reducing the importance of volume targets for equity investments, focusing on
quality deals and quasi-equity products. This will also help reduce pressures on the
deployable strategic capital created due to capital constraints. With respect to
adaptive management, management provides signals and incentives for lessons
focused on diverse aspects of our business, including project profitability,
development impact, and client engagement.

Feedback Loop to New Business. Management agrees that results and knowledge
gained from M4R activities should be looped back to future operations.
Management encourages lesson learning in all available platforms. With the various
initiatives mentioned above underway, we believe that IFC is on the right trajectory.
Self-evaluations by operational teams and IFC management aims to find
constructive ways to better utilize XPSRs for lessons and knowledge. In relation to
the formulation of management’s action plan in response to the Report on Self-
Evaluation Systems (ROSES), one contemplated scenario is to intentionally separate
or sequence the assessment related to accountability and learning in an investment
evaluation. Additional mechanisms to systematically require lessons identification
(similar to suggestions in the report) have also been under consideration, including
mentioning past lessons in the Concept Review Note discussing the relevant lessons
as part of the Immediate Response Mechanism.

Additional Advisory-Specific Concerns. IFC management reiterates the point that it
had shared with IEG earlier that the client capacity support analysis of the M4R
review would have been more meaningful if the criteria or approach had been


                                                                                   xix

chosen more carefully and inclusively, factoring in the nature of various business
areas. The chosen approach, focusing on clients’ enhanced management
information, data, risk control, and financial reporting systems, inevitably excludes
IFC Advisory Services work other than with financial institutions. As a result, the
report found the most meaningful M4R for IFC Advisory Services to be in
microfinance and insurance, where these are naturally the types of solutions that
may be recommended to the client. However, it would be important to recognize
that six other IFC Advisory Services Business Areas also contributed to
strengthening M4R, for instance, by improving the understanding of issues and
challenges and by prompting implementation of potential solutions.

Management notes the concern raised about IFC Advisory Services not consistently
adjusting project log frames to reflect changes in project circumstances, thus
preventing the monitoring of accurate outcome achievement. IFC management
wishes to clarify that the governance system, which is uniform across all Advisory
Services and includes the controls for log frame changes, was implemented several
years ago, benefitting from IEG’s strong inputs. IFC will aim to more consistently
update the log frames now that IEG has clearly confirmed that it would rate the
outcome against the adjusted framework, and not the original set at the time of
approval.

Clarifications. IFC management wishes to clarify two things that may not be clear in
the report. First, regarding the statement that IEG finds that the investment and
advisory M&E indicators are not always tracked consistently, management
reiterates that it tracks a series of standard M&E indicators systematically and
consistently through project maturity. This tracking is undertaken once a year for
investments through DOTS and twice a year for advisory projects through the
Advisory Services Operational Portal. IFC suggests that IEG contact IFC about its
data validation process. Second, regarding the statement that the absolute numbers
in the reach indicators are not reflected in relative terms for country or regional
context, IFC’s practice is to present project-level reach indicators against the targets
agreed with IFC management. Data users can apply the absolute numbers for
various analytic purposes, such as country, region, instrument sector, and theme.

Development Results. IFC management acknowledges that IFC’s investment
development outcome success rate for the cohort CY13–15 was 54 percent on an
unweighted basis, as measured by the binary share of positively rated investments
in the evaluated sample. According to the IEG data posted on the intranet tableau,
the success rate on a weighted basis was 65 percent.1 In both, the trend is

downward, which also agrees with the recent trend in DOTS. The report attributes
this primarily to the decline in IFC work quality (defined as appraisal, structuring,
screening and supervision) and net commitment (project size) of projects. IFC
management has been monitoring the downward trend in the past several years,
particularly this year since the last RAP Board discussion. The three-year rolling
sample (CY13-15) includes investment projects approved and executed since CY08,
primarily during the major financial crises. During the years that followed the global
financial crisis, emerging markets were hit by one of the largest slowdowns in recent
history, as well as by volatility, currency depreciation, low commodity prices, and
local and regional instability. These external factors were important in the declining
performance. The IEG-IFC joint study (discussed below) revealed that the effects of
the difficult business environment on IFC’s development performance were likely to
have been compounded by IFC’s internal changes which, however, were being
implemented with the goal of increasing IFC’s impact in the long run. As for the
issue of net commitment to projects being the reason for the declining investment
development outcome, management understands that this points to the smaller size
of the net commitments in the cohort. This appears to be in line with IFC’s general
approach to support smaller investments strategically through partnering with
financial institutions. IFC takes note of IEG’s analysis.

IEG-IFC Joint Study on IFC Investment Development Outcomes. Immediately after
the last RAP Board discussion, during which IFC management committed to a close
examination of IFC investments’ declining outcomes, IFC undertook a joint study
with IEG on the subject with a focus on work quality. The study found that both
external and internal factors were responsible for the trend over the last few years,
in line with IEG’s analysis presented last year. While it was clear to IEG and IFC that
external factors, notably the global financial crisis, had affected the outcomes of the
investment cohorts in CY12–14 XPSRs, the study purposely focused on IFC’s
internal factors—how IFC developed, screened, structured, processed, and managed
projects in the current operating environment. The study broadly confirmed the IEG
observation that shortcomings in work quality ultimately aggravated impacts from
the difficult market environment. Internal factors, including an ambitious IFC
growth strategy with higher risk taking, combined with a significant
decentralization process, seemed to have led to reduced work quality, thereby
compromising IFC’s project selection, analyses and supervision. To help reverse this
trend the study recommended actions in the areas of incentives, organizational
alignment, staffing and human resources, knowledge access, and macro
assessments. Management is pleased to report that in conjunction with the corporate
Diagnostics and reorganization effected on January 1, 2017, some of the
recommended actions—such as assigning the same investment team throughout the

project cycle, strengthening the accountability structure, and clarifying roles in
investment teams—are already underway. In the context of the IFC 3.0 strategy, the
newly established Economics and Private Sector Development Vice Presidential Unit
will strengthen macro, market, and country assessments for project selection and
design. Management will carefully work with staff for high quality work in
investment executions toward a rebound in development performance in the near
future. Management plans to share the study with the Board after an action plan is
internally approved.

Telecom, Media, Technology, and Venture Capital and Funds Department. With
respect to the development outcome success rate and the analysis, management
wishes to make three points. First, because of the nature of the venture capital
business, the approach to development performance success is inevitably different
from that in more traditional businesses. Most projects are expected not to perform
well, but there should be a few significant successful projects. IFC’s portfolio
reviews have demonstrated this. Second, the observation that post-crisis support for
“first-time fund managers” was one of the key reasons for the low success rate is not
aligned with IFC’s experience. Third, regarding the funds business, management is
concerned that a wide gap has been prominent between the development
performance measured by XPSR cohorts and DOTS, especially in recent years. While
management is aware of framework differences, the gap is much wider than that in
other industries. In this regard, a closer examination of the sample would be helpful.

Infrastructure and Natural Resources Department. The underlying data show that
the share of investments in the Infrastructure and Natural Resources cohort was
large at 85 percent, with high quality work—strong appraisal, screening and
structuring (at 73 percent) as recognized in the report, and also by supervision and
administration (at 88 percent)—as well as a strong role and contribution by IFC (at
85 percent). While IFC’s overall development performance was 65 percent (on a non-
weighted basis), the share of positively rated investment outcomes increased two
years consecutively to 73 percent, and 85 percent of the cohort was rated positively
in environmental and social effects for the second year. In addition, IFC notes the
report finding that project design, structuring and adverse external factors, such as
geopolitical instability, regulatory changes and commodity price fluctuations led to
less-than-satisfactory development outcomes. Management also notes the
recommendation for teams to consider ex-ante downstream assessments and factor
in conservative estimates on business growth and economic returns in project
structuring.

Advisory Services. Management notes the 61 percent development effectiveness
success, noting that not all FY15 completed projects were rated. Most notable dips

are stated in the report to have occurred outside of the development effectiveness
metric, namely in the areas of IFC’s role and contribution and of design quality—
metrics that were introduced after January 2015.

Small Samples. Management would appreciate that results calculated with small
number of projects (for example, less than five) not be included in the report’s
analysis. This is particularly important in the tables of the Regional Annexes and
Advisory Service Business Areas.

Change in Development Outcome Success Rate Calculation in Relation to No
Opinion Possible. Management would appreciate IEG’s consideration in changing
the methodology used in the report’s analysis to exclude No Opinion Possible
projects from the denominator in the calculation of development outcomes.

MIGA Management Comments
MIGA Development Results. The report notes that the development outcome
success rates of the guarantee projects of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) remained steady at around 61 percent. MIGA notes the important
lesson identified in IEG’s evaluation of the MIGA guarantee to a Tunisian state-
owned shipping company: that MIGA’s non-honoring guarantees can have a
valuable countercyclical role in helping projects and companies with sound
fundamentals to access financing that would otherwise be too costly or out of reach.

Feedback Loops. MIGA welcomes the report’s recognition of the progress of
adaptive management specific to MIGA. As the report notes, in recent years MIGA
has consistently used its self-evaluations and validations mechanism to identify
lessons, and has used the knowledge gained in its new business reviews through a
combination of information systems and knowledge events. In particular, MIGA
notes from IEG’s 2016 Report on Self-Evaluation Systems that MIGA’s seminar series
on Learning from Evaluations has been identified as good practice within the World
Bank Group for learning from evaluation.

Client Capacity Development. While the report states that MIGA has a limited role
in client capacity development, it also notes that MIGA provides active guidance
and monitoring for strengthening environmental and social performance results.
MIGA notes the example cited in the report of an oil and gas sector project in
Uzbekistan, where the MIGA team helped solve critical environmental and social
issues by convening external industry experts.

Political Risk Insurance Industry Development. MIGA welcomes the report’s
recognition of MIGA’s important role in shaping the political risk insurance


                                                                                     xxiii

industry. In particular, the report notes MIGA’s support to the industry through its
reinsurance business. In 2013, MIGA modified its frameworks for allowing the use
of reinsurance at shorter tenors compared with the underlying guarantee contracts.
The change allowed MIGA to expand the panel of facultative reinsurers for
optimizing reinsurance capacity for larger, longer-tenor projects that are beneficial
to MIGA clients.

Streamlining Project Evaluations. In discussing the MAR, the report notes IEG’s
recommendation to streamline the project evaluation approach and process to align
more closely with MIGA’s business model and conditions on data gathering, which
stemmed from IEG’s 2013 Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation: Assessing the
Monitoring and Evaluation Systems of IFC and MIGA. MIGA notes that this
recommendation has been implemented satisfactorily—with significant progress in
streamlining project evaluations—and hence was retired in 2015, after discussion
and agreement between MIGA and IEG.

Methodological issues. MIGA notes that a comprehensive and appropriate
assessment of MIGA’s development outcome performance is presented only in the
main text of the report. There it shows the distribution of ratings as: (i) satisfactory
or better; (ii) No Opinion Possible (NOP); and (iii) less than satisfactory. IEG does
not apply this comprehensive approach consistently in the report. For example, in
the Regional Results and Performance discussion in appendix I and in footnote 15 of
chapter 2, the computation of “success” rates include NOP-rated projects in the total
project count. The result of this “success” rate formulation is that it treats NOP-rated
projects as equivalent to projects rated less than satisfactory. This approach is
mathematically flawed and misleading, detracting from the IEG objective of
providing a comprehensive assessment of MIGA performance, and hence not useful,
in MIGA’s view. More generally, the mathematical error in the success rate
computation would diminish the accountability and learning value of IEG’s flagship
report, given the erroneous basis for the findings. MIGA notes that the change to
MIGA’s success rate computation was made without any prior notification or
consultation with MIGA, in violation of the agreed protocol between management of
World Bank Group institutions and IEG. MIGA believes that the presentation in the
main section of the report of MIGA projects is the appropriate one, including with
respect to the calculation of success rates, and that this approach should be applied
throughout the report. This approach also provides continuity and consistency with
the approach used earlier for computing success rates (i.e., excluding NOP-rated
projects from the Total Project Count) in previous RAPs.

1. Managing for Results
 Highlights
  The World Bank Group has taken several important steps over more than a decade to address
   the principles of managing for development results; progress is notable on instituting a structure
   and process for measurement and less so on adaptive management and learning.
  The World Bank Group’s management for results is affected by weaknesses in measurement of
   outcomes, adaptive management based on evidence, and by generally weak client systems that
   generate results data.
  The World Bank Group is addressing client capacity to manage for results through various
   instruments and approaches; the effectiveness and results of these efforts have not yet been
   assessed.
  The World Bank Group is at a good point to take stock of its progress and systematically plan for
   and address the now well-known constraints to strengthening both measurement and adaptive
   management and learning.


Why Address Managing for Results Now?
Important developments since 2013 have resulted in a renewed and qualitatively
different emphasis on results within the World Bank Group. These developments
include the following:

       The World Bank Group established a new strategy in 2013 for contributing to
        the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.
       The 18th Replenishment of IDA (IDA18), the largest replenishment to date,
        took place in 2016 with a greater emphasis on results.
       Forward Look: A Vision for the World Bank Group in 2030 recently detailed the
        organization’s role in global economic development.

More broadly, as the Millennium Development Goals ended in 2015, the
development community renewed its commitment to a set of more ambitious
Sustainable Development Goals.

Analyses based on evaluations of World Bank Group projects demonstrate
empirically that key elements of managing for results (M4R) are important for
achieving outcomes. For example, a recent study showed that a good monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) framework (that is, data and evidence) is positively and
significantly associated with project outcome ratings, controlling for a number of



                                                                                                        1

MANAGING FOR RESULTS
factors (Raimondo 2016). A World Bank Internal Audit Department report (IAD
2015) similarly found that 85 percent of problem projects with a high M&E rating
received a satisfactory outcome rating from the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG), compared with 45 percent of problem projects with a low M&E rating. How
the purposeful use of data and evidence help to achieve results has been well
documented externally as well (Oportunidades program in Mexico, the Government
Accountability Office, and the UK National Audit Office, for example).1

International agreements, including the 2005 Paris Declaration, the 2008 Accra
Agenda for Action, and the 2011 Busan Declaration, also highlighted the importance
of M4R, and described how to operationalize the M4R in international development.
Drawing on cumulative international development experience and research, they
emphasized that the results—that is, development results—are for and of the client
countries that need strong client M4R capacity for their achievement (see, for
example, the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation).2

This is an opportune time to assess the World Bank Group’s progress on managing
for results. This chapter acknowledges the accomplishments to date and synthesizes
and presents cumulative evidence from IEG studies to highlight areas that require
in-depth review and concrete action.


What Is Managing for Development Results?
Managing for results (M4R) is generally defined as a management strategy or
approach aligned with achieving organizational results. For this review’s purposes,
M4R refers specifically to managing for development results. M4R’s concepts and
approaches have a long history in both the private and public sectors, and much
academic and applied literature exists on the topic (for example, GAO 2015 and
Kang 2005). The literature integrates the concepts of measurement, assessment,
management, learning, and decision making, and highlights two interdependent
principles of M4R with an emphasis on outcomes, not simply on inputs, processes,
and outputs. The two principles are:

       Developing a robust system for measuring results (for example, a results
        framework). First, desired results are identified, defined, and communicated
        clearly; and, second, data related to the results and to preceding factors
        important for ongoing decision making (based on a change theory) are
        collected and monitored on an ongoing basis (figure 1.1).
       Instituting adaptive management and ongoing learning. First, data from the
        measurement system are used for different types of decision making for

                                                                   MANAGING FOR RESULTS
        continual improvement to achieve results; and second, data and evidence are
        also used to learn about and understand the drivers of results.

        Source: IEG.

Using the principles above, the 2016 Results and Performance of the World Bank Group
(RAP) report addresses how, and how effectively, the World Bank Group
approached M4R. Specifically:

       How, and how effectively, did it measure development results?
       How, and how effectively, did it engage in and support adaptive
        management and learning to achieve results?

The report also provides a brief exploratory assessment of how the World Bank
Group supported client capacity for M4R, given its acknowledged importance in
achieving development results.


Limitations of this Review
The report starts with the premise that the primary goal of the World Bank Group’s
M4R is to drive development results for its clients (through its projects, investments,
guarantees, country strategies, and other client services). It summarizes the World
Bank Group’s M4R efforts regarding the two questions as they relate directly to
development results. Therefore, it does not review operational and financial
processes and systems, such as personnel performance management, procurement,
financial management, or revenue models, although these also intrinsically support
(or hinder) managing for development results. The report relies on a pattern of
evidence and findings from existing IEG evaluations. It does not cover the entire
portfolio comprehensively, nor does it cover World Bank Group initiatives that are
addressing M4R but have not yet been evaluated. The exploratory review of World
Bank Group support for client M4R capacity is based primarily on a desk review of
project-level evaluations and the limited number of existing country strategies since

FY14, as in-depth evaluation of this topic has not yet been undertaken. This report
presents a potential baseline but does not draw comprehensive conclusions
regarding this topic.


M4R History—More than a Decade with Some Success
The World Bank Group has addressed the two M4R principles—measurement and
adaptive management and learning—for more than a decade and successively
refined its approach, though at a somewhat uneven pace.

IEG’s annual report on operations evaluation in 1998 was the first report that
substantially addressed M4R, explaining that the World Bank had not yet formally
adopted M4R, but that it was highly relevant for the Strategic Compact, the then-
ongoing renewal process (World Bank 1998).3 It concluded that instituting a culture
for M4R would take sustained effort for several years. The World Bank formally
articulated its M4R approach a few years later in Better Measuring, Monitoring, and
Managing for Development Results (World Bank 2002). Four years later, Accelerating the
Results Agenda: Progress and Next Steps, a report to the Committee on Development
Effectiveness, outlined further actions (World Bank 2006). The World Bank
recognized that the principles of M4R in international development should apply to
its work, so the plan also emphasized enhancing countries’ statistical systems, M&E
capacity, and knowledge base to manage for results. The third main renewal of these
efforts began with the 2013 strategy, with enhanced focus on results and on
monitoring and measuring results as “One World Bank Group” (World Bank 2013).

As part of these efforts, the World Bank introduced a results measurement system
(RMS) for the International Development Association (IDA) in 2002 to track
systematically key country outcomes and IDA’s contributions to those outcomes
(IDA 2006). This system was enhanced during subsequent IDA replenishments, and
an updated RMS for IDA18 was agreed in December 2016. The World Bank in 2009
gradually introduced core sector indicators across its IDA portfolio to improve the
consistency and quality of sectoral and thematic results monitoring and reporting at
the project level, and 2014 saw the introduction of the first Corporate Scorecard
covering all three World Bank Group institutions. The Corporate Scorecard built on
the IDA RMS and was expanded to include International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) countries, to track and communicate results, and to be an
important input into decision making by focusing management attention on key
indicators. Scorecards for both the World Bank Group and the World Bank have a
matching three-tier structure with key indicators: goals and development context,

                                                                    MANAGING FOR RESULTS
results, and World Bank Group performance (World Bank 2014, 2016k,l). The
Corporate Scorecard will be renewed in FY18 (World Bank 2016c).

The World Bank also introduced results-based country assistance strategies (CASs)
in 2005 and the Program-for-Results (PforR) in 2011. A renewed World Bank Group-
wide evidence-based country engagement model consisting of systematic country
diagnostics (SCDs) and country partnership frameworks (CPFs) was developed in
2013. It was designed to contribute concretely to the sustainable achievement of the
World Bank Group’s twin goals within countries.

The World Bank established the Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative in
2005 and has continued attending to strengthening client statistical capacity with trust
funds and statistical operations.4 The Global Delivery Initiative, launched in 2015,
provides practitioners with collective and cumulative evidence to build and share
evidence-based knowledge of implementation science. The Results Measurement and
Evidence Stream was established as a network of support for World Bank Group
professionals engaged in M&E. Other initiatives have been undertaken at the vice
presidency levels as well, including for example the “Initiative to Enhance Outcomes”
in East Asia and the Pacific and the “African Gender Innovation Lab” to enhance focus
on results and evidence throughout the project cycle. Recently, the World Bank Group
agreed on an action plan to address data gaps, the first pillar of which supports country
capacity to produce, disseminate, and use data.5 In addition, actions are underway with
respect to strengthening incentives, behaviors, and processes related to achieving
development outcomes, based on recent IEG evaluation recommendations. Externally,
the World Bank Group participates in the Managing for Development Results
Community of Practice for mutual learning and benchmarking among international
development banks.6

The World Bank also introduced structural and functional reforms between 2010 and
2013, reflecting changing perspectives on the best way to manage for results more
adaptively. The reorganization into Global Practices pivoted the institution toward
becoming a “solutions bank.” At the same time, the Quality Assurance Group
(established in 1996), which monitored portfolio quality at entry (including results
frameworks) was disbanded in 2010, and the World Bank Group-wide Results Steering
Group (established in 2006) discontinued functioning. Units in the Operations Policy
and Country Services (OPCS) Vice Presidency took on both of those functions.

M4R REFORMS SPECIFIC TO IFC
Monitoring and evaluation of IFC operations started in 1994 with the creation of the
Operations Evaluation Unit (later merged into IEG). IFC, through its Development
Impact Unit, developed the Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) in


                                                                                        5

MANAGING FOR RESULTS
FY05 to monitor and measure the development outcomes of its investment and
advisory services, and began testing the IFC Development Goals (IDGs) and the
Corporate Scorecard in FY11 to help drive strategy implementation and business
decision making alongside other reforms. IFC also viewed the IDGs (Climate
Change, Micro/Individual Finance, SME Finance, Infrastructure and Agribusiness)
as a tool to help drive alignment across investment and advisory services activities.
IFC continued to refine and improve the IDGs between FY13 and FY15 while
positioning itself to conduct meta-evaluations (for example, effects of a cluster of
investment projects within a country or sector on job creation) and contribute to
CPFs and joint implementation plans.

IFC has been leading international financial institution initiatives since FY13 to
harmonize indicators in their private sector operations and to incorporate them into
the results reporting systems. The IFC Corporate Scorecard has two dimensions:
results (Tier II) and performance (Tier III). The IDGs constitute the core of the
results, which are presented in the broader categories of growth, sustainability, and
inclusiveness. The scorecard is intended to serve as an effective tool for IFC strategy
implementation and a comprehensive review.

M4R REFORMS SPECIFIC TO MIGA
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) established its own
development results monitoring system, the Development Effectiveness Indicator
System, modeled on DOTS. MIGA measured five key performance indicators to
assess its performance and productivity for more than a decade and expanded the
key performance indicators in FY15 to develop a Corporate Scorecard that is
presented in the World Bank Group Scorecard. MIGA’s scorecard reports on
development impact, financial sustainability, and client satisfaction, and captures
both financial and development results, along with operational efficiency indicators
and achievement of strategic priorities, such as guarantees for projects in situations
of fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV) and in IDA countries. The World Bank
Group Scorecard features two MIGA performance indicators: development outcome
rating and the time for operational delivery (concept-to-guarantee issuance time).

IEG’S ROLE IN M4R
IEG has a core role within the World Bank Group M4R system through its
systematic validation of self-evaluation reports and its independent evaluations. The
evaluations provide recommendations to which management of the World Bank
Group institutions responds with an action plan for those with which it agrees
(chapter 3 provides more details). The annual RAP reports systematically on World
Bank Group results as shown through its project validations and evaluation

                                                                    MANAGING FOR RESULTS
findings. In recent years IEG has also increased its focus on learning and is piloting a
learning engagements business line that uses existing IEG evidence to support
evidence-based learning within the World Bank Group.

BOTTOM LINE: THE WORLD BANK GROUP HAS TAKEN KEY STEPS ON M4R PRINCIPLES
Reforms over more than a decade have clearly led to positive changes within the
World Bank Group, particularly with respect to the steady emphasis on results
measurement. These changes signaled the growing importance of M4R and placed
the World Bank Group at the forefront of these efforts. Based on assessments of its
M4R processes and systems, the 2012 Multilateral Organization Performance
Assessment Network report found that the World Bank Group showed leadership in
managing for and reporting on development results and was considered strong in
its evaluation of results and knowledge dissemination. The benefits of the ongoing
and recent M4R-related reforms will likely continue to accrue in the future. As the
sections below summarize, IEG finds that the steps completed are necessary, but not
sufficient, and the World Bank Group needs to continue to address some core
challenges.


What Is the Evidence on the World Bank Group’s M4R?
This section reviews how effectively the World Bank Group performed with respect
to the two principles of M4R—measurement and adaptive management and
learning—based on IEG evidence.

MEASURING DEVELOPMENT RESULTS
The M4R principle of results measurement requires collecting timely, good-quality
data on outcomes of interest and on factors that affect these outcomes (per the
SMART criteria and basic measurement principles).7 The World Bank Group
contributes to the twin goals and to outcomes that are more proximal. It typically
measures its results through M&E systems established as part of the World Bank
Group’s client services.8 However, evidence in a vast majority of fully disclosed
major IEG evaluations and learning products completed in FY15 and FY16 (27 out of
33) shows that key aspects of results measurement—data availability and focus on
outcomes—will need attention for a sustained period (appendix A presents the list
of IEG evaluations conducted in FY15–16 and their findings related to this topic).

Measuring World Bank Group Goals

The Poverty Focus of Country Programs: Lessons from World Bank Experience (IEG 2015j)
highlighted large gaps in income and consumption data for several countries,



                                                                                        7
CHAPTER 1
MANAGING FOR RESULTS
especially in Africa and FCV countries. The evaluation identified several challenges in
producing high-quality data for measuring poverty. The World Bank Group’s Poverty
and Shared Prosperity 2016: Taking on Inequality (World Bank 2016d) similarly noted
progress, but also highlighted data deprivation as a key challenge.

Measuring Operations’ Outcomes

IEG finds good focus on the outputs of World Bank Group operations (important for
implementation), but often notes insufficient emphasis on measuring outcomes to
which the World Bank Group operations contribute. Outcomes are defined as the
beneficiary-level (including individuals, households, firms) changes and benefits from
project processes and outputs, such as improved nutrition intake, shortened
commuting time, utilization of financial services, and improved air quality.

Learning from IDA Experience: Lessons from IEG Evaluations (IEG 2016g) summarized
existing evidence from several evaluations and found a paucity of data on the
impact of World Bank Group work on the many types of outcomes it aimed to
address, such as youth employment, nutritional and welfare outcomes of food crisis
and mitigation programs, and climate change and adaptation-related outcomes. IEG
evaluation on capital market development (IEG 2016t) made a similar point,
concluding that data issues affect the capital markets program, and databases do not
capture local currency bond market development.

Operations also need to strengthen their focus on articulating and measuring
outcomes. World Bank Group Support to Electricity Access, FY2000–2014: An
Independent Evaluation (IEG 2015q) noted shortcomings in tracking economic and
welfare outcomes. An IEG evaluation on financial inclusion (IEG 2015b) found that
45 percent of the projects tracked process and outputs, but only 2 percent reported
on beneficiary effects, such as improvements in welfare or increases in income.
Industry, Competitiveness, and Jobs (IEG 2016e) noted that the complex challenges of
articulating and measuring jobs-related objectives need to be addressed, given that
employment is a key aspect of the productivity and competitiveness agenda. An IEG
evaluation on early childhood development (IEG 2015s) made similar observations.
This deficiency also at times affects PforR. Program-for-Results: An Early-Stage
Assessment of the Process and Effects of a New Lending Instrument (IEG 2016k) found
that the results frameworks are often reasonably coherent, but objectives that lead to
clear results at the outcome level are rare. It concluded that the objectives in the
project appraisal document (PAD) could go beyond the program period itself to
consider longer-term outcome-level objectives.

                                                                  MANAGING FOR RESULTS
Measuring outcomes regarding gender and FCV status also requires attention. RAP
2015 discussed the inadequacy of gender-related indicators.9 When present, the
indicators tended to measure outputs instead of outcomes. In September 2016, the
World Bank revised its protocol for recording integration of gender in projects. 10
Learning from IDA Experience: Lessons from IEG Evaluations IEG (2016g) illustrated
that projects in FCV situations have conflict-related objectives, but the results
frameworks do not identify their outcomes.

IEG’s review of development policy operations’ results frameworks found that
objectives were often vague, and the results frameworks measured processes instead
of outcomes. For example, Lessons from Environmental Policy Lending (IEG 2016i)
found a risk that the World Bank is focusing on the short term and could consider
long-term, policy-related performance. However, the current World Bank evaluation
system does not support the longer-term data collection required.

Other Aspects of Designing Robust Results Frameworks

Baselines are an important component of results frameworks for measuring
improvements in the outcomes to which the World Bank Group aims to contribute.
Learning and Results in the World Bank Operations: Toward a New Learning Strategy (IEG
2015g) found that projects often do not collect data when the projects begin, and
implementation status and results reports often misleadingly indicate baselines as
zero. Results Frameworks in Country Strategies: Lessons from Evaluations (IEG 2015n)
noted that despite instituting results-based CASs, the results frameworks in country
strategies had weak links between designed interventions and outcomes and weak
indicators to track outcomes. For example, IEG’s World Bank Group Engagement in
Resource-Rich Developing Countries (IEG 2015p) found that although diversification
was the overarching strategy objective in these countries, no mechanisms were in
place to monitor this objective. The forthcoming IEG evaluation on SCD and CPF
process and implementation finds that the results chains are better defined, and the
identification of monitorable and measurable indicators for the results has improved
over the past, though they do not always capture the intended objectives. On the
other hand, the role of the World Bank Group’s program in contributing to the
achievement of outcomes is often not well thought through and explained.

Measuring IFC Development Results

 A review by an external auditor suggested that although IFC has pioneered several
best practices in aspects of M&E reporting (such as Performance Standards), IFC
should continue to strengthen beneficiary-level indicators and limit the use of
estimations and extrapolations of results to ensure accuracy (IFC 2016). IEG concurs

MANAGING FOR RESULTS
with this view based on its independent findings from project validations and
thematic evaluations (IEG 2014a, 2015b,d).

Gaps exist in IFC M4R at the beneficiary level, in results related to private sector
development,11 and in joint practices. IEG finds that the project M&E indicators
(investment services or advisory services) are not always tracked consistently through
project maturity or through the DOTS systems (appendix B), and the absolute
numbers presented in the reach indicators are not reflected in relative terms to
provide a good understanding of the country or regional context.

Furthermore, the two indicators tracked in the Department Scorecard and the IFC
Corporate Scorecard—economic performance percentage rating and private sector
development percentage rating—are from the DOTS framework and not from IEG-
validated results, which show lower levels of achievement. The private sector
development ratings do not necessarily capture auditable, verified outcome results,
but instead rely on estimates from IFC and, in many cases, results from unverified
client surveys, suggesting data quality needs improving.

Even when data related to private sector development are strong at the beneficiary
level, the overall country-level performance is not captured effectively because the
World Bank and IFC’s roles and responsibilities in the country-level frameworks are
not yet well defined. This is especially true when the project is a large, first-time IFC
intervention in the sector (the most notable cases are in the Sub-Saharan Africa and
Latin America and the Caribbean Regions). The forthcoming IEG report, An Early
Assessment of SCD/CPF Process and Implementation, also emphasizes the need for a
more explicit inclusion in the results frameworks of the current and future areas
where IFC and MIGA intend to focus their support.

Furthermore, IEG’s review of self-evaluations and validations for FY13–15 shows
that IFC engagements with repeat clients (appendix B) were more conventional than
an exploration of ways to incrementally improve results at the borrower and
beneficiary levels. Although additionality (financial and nonfinancial) does not
distinguish between new clients and repeat clients, the latter could potentially
provide verifiable, auditable data at the beneficiary level because repeat clients are
more familiar with IFC standards and procedures.

Measuring MIGA Development Results

IEG validations of traditional political risk insurance (PRI) guarantee projects
suggest that MIGA has continued to strengthen in results frameworks and align its
Performance Standards monitoring and reporting to that of IFC, yielding positive
results. Recent IEG validations of MIGA non-honoring projects (three projects)

                                                                              CHAPTER 1
                                                                   MANAGING FOR RESULTS
suggest that the current monitoring, reporting, and evaluation framework, though
suitable for traditional PRI guarantees, could be improved for the newer instrument
to capture public sector risks.12 The ability to collect data and outcomes at the level
of public sector obligors and beneficiaries is challenging for MIGA based on existing
frameworks, thus warranting additional risk assessments during underwriting and
contract management. The paucity of project performance data has led to rating of
No Opinion Possible for the development effectiveness indicator (seven projects in
the FY10–15 review period).

In sequenced or joint Bank Group projects, IEG project evaluations suggest that
MIGA should enhance its project-level results monitoring and measurement to
capture client-level and country-level results and for guarantee holders who are also
IFC clients. Recent IEG evaluations during FY13–15 (specifically China’s water
sector, Sub-Saharan Africa extractives sector, and Turkey’s transport sector) suggest
that internal World Bank Group protocols hinder MIGA’s ability to access project
performance indicators, even though such information is readily available to IFC as
the project lender or project company shareholder.

In infrastructure and financial markets sectors, MIGA has several key repeat-
business clients (two or more projects with the same guarantee holder between FY09
and FY15) who are familiar with MIGA and the World Bank Group’s development
mandate and could be more receptive toward monitoring and measuring
incremental beneficiary-level results through the life of the guarantee. Management
of the World Bank Group institutions could facilitate such an incremental approach,
especially for joint World Bank Group projects and for MIGA clients who are also
IFC clients.

Although MIGA has other risk assessment indicators in place, such as project
business performance risk, sovereign risk, and risk to MIGA profitability, gaps exist
in its articulation, identification, and discussion of risks to development outcomes at
both underwriting and during the life of the guarantee, specifically in non-honoring
guarantee projects exposed to public sector default risk. In such cases, MIGA can
learn and adapt from the World Bank’s results frameworks.

ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND LEARNING TO ACHIEVE RESULTS
Adaptive management and learning can be instituted at the project (or program)
and corporate levels to drive development results, but it takes intentionality and
discipline to do so. Evidence and data are fundamental inputs to informed
judgments that underpin adaptive management and learning, and they need to be
tailored to specific purposes at different levels of the organization.



                                                                                     11
CHAPTER 1
MANAGING FOR RESULTS
Two main mechanisms exist to drive project development outcomes: using evidence
generated by M&E systems to learn and make adjustments, and applying evidence-
based lessons to new project design and implementation. At the corporate level,
adaptive management involves using the scorecard (and associated instruments,
such as memoranda of understanding) to focus on strategic issues and make
deliberate choices in organizational directions, taking into account leading
indicators based on empirical evidence and actual results achieved.

Two recent IEG evaluations documented the challenges in these areas. World Bank
projects are generally weak in their attempts to learn empirically about the validity
of the change theory underpinning the project or program, and about other factors
that might affect outcomes. The outcomes need not be expected to be achieved
entirely and uniquely by World Bank Group investments, but managing for results
requires some expected level of verifiable contribution.

Learning and Results in World Bank Operations: Toward a New Learning Strategy (IEG
2015g) found that only about 28 percent of the projects reviewed for the study
discuss the diverse factors that might have affected the project outcomes. Fifty-eight
percent of the projects with some outcome evidence used a pre-post evaluation
design to assess efficacy in implementation completion and results reports (ICRs)
with no control or comparison groups or attempts to provide potential alternative
explanations based on a change theory. The Poverty Focus of Country Programs (IEG
2015j) and Learning Note: Additional Financing for Transport and Information and
Communication Technology (IEG 2015h) highlighted that attributing the outcomes
measured to World Bank–supported interventions is often not possible, thus leaving
open questions about the efficacy of the World Bank Group’s investments.

Furthermore, 27 percent of projects reviewed for Behind the Mirror: A Report on the
Self-Evaluation Systems of the World Bank Group (IEG 2016a) conducted their mid-term
review in the third quarter, relatively late for timely adjustments to project design
and implementation. The projects rarely assessed unintended consequences.

The World Bank Group introduced impact evaluations more than 10 years ago for
learning, improving project design and interventions, and identifying impact. IEG’s
World Bank Group Impact Evaluations: Relevance and Effectiveness (IEG 2012b)
recommended identifying topics for impact evaluation strategically and improving
the integration of evaluations into project design. However, IEG (2016a) reported
that strategic selection was still not evident, and the Management Action Record
shows that the recommendation-related actions are not complete (chapter 3).

                                                                     MANAGING FOR RESULTS
On the positive side, the World Bank developed safeguard policies to guard
against—and mitigate—potential negative outcomes associated with its investment
operations. IEG’s safeguard evaluation (IEG 2010) found that the World Bank
Group’s safeguards and sustainability policies have helped to avoid or mitigate
large-scale environmental and social (E&S) risks in its investment projects, but it also
found inconsistent categorization of risk as well as deficiencies in monitoring of E&S
safeguards results. An assessment of safeguards compliance is beyond the scope of
this review. However, an assessment of safeguard-related reporting in 119 ICRs
reviewed by IEG between August 2015 and June 2016 was conducted to check
whether ICRs of projects that triggered safeguards contained the safeguard-related
information required by the ICR guidelines.13 Of the 119 projects, 103 triggered
safeguards, so that a summary of safeguards compliance would be required in those
103 ICRs. The assessment found that 53 of those 103 ICRs (51 percent) contained at
least one sentence stating whether or not all triggered safeguards policies had been
complied with, but the remaining 49 percent did not. Of the 53 ICRs that included
an explicit statement regarding compliance for all E&S safeguards, 32 (60 percent)
included a summary of “any problems that arose and their resolution.” Of the 15
Category A (highest risk) projects in this group, 11 ICRs lacked a summary of
whether or not all triggered safeguards policies had been complied with.

The 2013 World Bank Group Strategy (World Bank 2013) cited the importance of
engaging with citizens to understand the results they value and experience, and
using that information to improve program effectiveness. IEG (2016a) showed that
less than half of the projects with clearly identifiable beneficiaries and that exited the
portfolio in FY14 used beneficiary surveys. Although beneficiary feedback at the
design stage has improved, shifting to collecting feedback during implementation
continues to be challenging.

Interviews conducted by IEG (2016a) showed that 78 percent of staff specifically
mentioned that there are either negative or no incentives for candid self-evaluation
that would lead to learning. Corporate results reporting can distort incentives and
lead staff to favor reporting positive outcomes or become excessively risk averse. At
the same time, the review highlighted the World Bank’s approval and disbursement
culture, thus indicating that inputs have priority over outcomes (IEG 2015g). In
addition, there continues to be an organizational need for better matching staff
capacity to the requirements for different aspects of M4R and for strengthening staff
skills, competencies, and career paths in areas where there are gaps (IEG 2016a).

Project M&E quality reflects these concerns. IEG rated only a small portion of FY15
project exits (27 percent) as significant or high, thus limiting M&E’s utility for
evidence-based learning and adaptive management.


                                                                                        13
CHAPTER 1
MANAGING FOR RESULTS
No clear information is available on how the World Bank Group uses evidence and
data for strategic adaptive management at the corporate level. The Corporate
Scorecard provides three tiers of data, yet it is unclear how Tier II indicators that
communicate the World Bank Group’s specific contributions to client countries’
development incentivize adaptive management. The results are based on absolute
numbers achieved, rather than percent of target, and operations in a few large
countries are likely to skew the results. Furthermore, they do not convey a sense of
how the World Bank Group is doing with respect to its targets. The Board also
requested actionable indicators that can help inform strategy in pursuit of results.
Additional indicators are tracked at the vice presidential unit and project levels,
which could provide learning (Blanc et al. 2016, for example). Whether the volume
of indicators and their reporting makes sense, and whether they support or hinder
learning and management at different levels of the organization are questions that
need review.

ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT SPECIFIC TO IFC
IFC continues to focus on adaptive management, but challenges remain. The FY16
Board-endorsed budget paper addresses IFC’s efforts to enhance institutional and
scorecard results frameworks by triangulating project results with country
frameworks, budget and personnel resources, and IDGs and targets.

Lessons in IFC (IEG 2016h) highlighted the importance of the LessonFinder database
(lessons from self-evaluations and validations of IFC and MIGA projects) for
operational team learning, and lessons not already emphasized or mainstreamed in
new business operations. The report highlighted IFC’s strong oral communication
culture when it comes to learning, sharing, and applying lessons. Therefore, some
internal learning efforts are deliberately focused on face-to-face engagements. The
IFC Special Operations department is one place from which investment teams
actively seek lessons and integrate them into operations.14 The unit’s objective is to
reverse potentially bad outcomes of underperforming projects in part by using
project data (financial, risk, and economic) to improve outcomes. A Special
Operations database captures successful turnaround stories, which the unit shares
with IFC investment teams in various forums, training programs, and events.

Integrating lessons from evaluated investment projects into new business poses
challenges, despite the emphasis. Capturing early warning signs in the project
through portfolio management, using dedicated client relationship managers, and
implementing active postcompletion supervision were reasons for successful
adaptive management at the project level. A 2014 IEG survey of IFC staff found that
IFC does not have an effective lesson learning system, even though staff recognize
the value of lesson learning and corporate culture does not repress it. Seventy

                                                                    MANAGING FOR RESULTS
percent of staff reported either negative, weak, no link to rewards and recognition
for lesson learning activities (IEG 2016h). Furthermore, advisory services
institutionalized lesson learning more than investment services, mainly because
project supervision reports and project completion reports are mandatory for all
advisory projects, and the reports include a section for lessons learned. Investment
Services does not systematically require lessons identification, and neither approval
(Board) nor supervision credit risk rating (CRR) documents include a mandatory
section for lessons learned. Only the Expanded Project Supervision Report (self-
evaluation document) includes such a section. The learning culture and good
practice from advisory services on lesson learning could be incorporated early into
the concept review and investment review stages of investment services activities.

Despite these efforts, a FY16 IFC corporate staff survey revealed that staff
considered volume targets and project profitability as the most important metrics for
management, compared with development impact and client satisfaction levels.

Inconsistency in other areas of adaptive management in IFC advisory projects
continues to hinder outcome achievement, especially when circumstances in the
field change during project implementation. IFC advisory projects that have strong
intentions for M4R principles at approval (specifically in the microfinance and
insurance business areas) do not adjust the project log frame to reflect changes in
project scope, timing, and deliverables. An emerging finding from IEG’s qualitative
review (projects evaluated in the recent three-year period) is the need for uniform
approach in M&E log frame revisions during both project implementation and
systematic lessons capture from M&E, with support through appropriate incentives
from the IFC Advisory Services leadership team. In the past year, advisory services
teams have started instituting stronger controls around log frame changes outside of
the A2F/FIG/FAM business lines.

Mandate-to-disbursement is one of the newer indicators introduced in the IFC
Scorecard in FY14. Intuitively, this is a good indicator to track lending efficiency at
the department or industry level. However, statistical analysis for the recent cohort
of projects (FY13–15) reveals that mandate-to-disbursement is not a driver of
development outcome success ratings (appendix F). Newer indicators of this sort
may have other purposes for corporate-level M4R, but it could be worth checking
periodically for any links to beneficiary (private sector development results) or
borrower (satisfaction rates from client survey) results for adaptive management.

ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT SPECIFIC TO MIGA
Recent evaluations of MIGA projects show progress in adaptive management.
MIGA has consistently used its self-evaluations and validations mechanism in recent


                                                                                      15

MANAGING FOR RESULTS
years to identify lessons; and it has used the knowledge gained in its new business
reviews through a combination of information systems and knowledge events. In
select cases, MIGA conducted broad analysis (China’s water sector, for example) to
study the macroeconomic, sectoral, and country conditions before intervening
through issuances of new guarantees.

BOTTOM LINE: ADDRESSING M4R NEEDS EMPHASIS ON BOTH M4R PRINCIPLES
The World Bank Group has acknowledged the importance of M4R. However, the
challenges of data availability, focus on outcomes, and the overall quality of results
frameworks impede results measurement—regardless of whether results are
achieved. This situation likely undermines the potential of the scorecard and related
management instruments as strong tools for adaptive management. It is not clear
how current metrics on results inform (or can inform) decision making and learning
at different organizational levels. The Strategic Actions Program for Addressing
Development Data Gaps (2016) and the indicator reforms acknowledge the climb
ahead and are a good start for addressing the World Bank Group's measurement
challenges. In addition, incentives, strengthening staff capacity in areas of gaps in
M4R, and instilling culture of evidence-based learning and decision making need to
be strengthened. Action and reforms underway in these areas will need to be
considered within a holistic approach.


The World Bank Group Support to Client M4R Capacity
Clients’ institutional contexts and the quality of governance play a significant role in
outcomes (see for example World Development Report 2017), and principal-agent
problems mediate results achievement (Gaarder and Bartsch 2015, for example). The
international community has also repeatedly identified weak client M4R as a
constraint to measuring and achieving results, and the World Bank Group staff have
corroborated this observation (IEG 2016a). Staff believes that learning with clients is
the best guarantor of results, but learning from self-evaluations—typically in
collaboration with the client—remains relatively weak, particularly due to low client
capacity, leading to a vicious cycle (IEG 2016a). IEG evaluations (IEG 2015j) also
identified insufficient capacity and government budget as obstacles to collecting
data and managing for results. Recognizing that M4R capacity is an insufficient but
necessary condition for achieving results, this section explores the World Bank
Group’s role in strengthening clients’ capacity.

Throughout the years, the World Bank Group has invested in client M4R capacity
through projects, advisory services and analytics, and dedicated statistical capacity-
strengthening programs for data systems. Country strategies have also addressed

the topic. Given the importance of the results agenda, this section presents baseline
information to consider for moving forward.

The M4R principles of measurement and management can be operationalized through
several elements, including strengthening data systems, monitoring, evaluation,
evidence-based programming and policy making, results- or performance-based
budgeting, and results- or performance-based financing. M4R includes strengthening
corporate governance for private sector clients (figure 1.2).15 The next sections focus
on whether and to what extent these M4R elements were included in the World Bank
Group’s operations and country strategies.

                                                              addressed one or more
elements of clients’ M4R (49 percent). Among these, the majority supported
monitoring capacity (83 percent), and 70 percent supported evaluations. Twenty-six
percent specifically included impact evaluations, but a little more than half of these
operations clearly stated that they used information from the impact evaluation to
influence a policy, program, or project improvement. Most of these elements were
activities embedded in larger components (79 percent), although a few projects
included them as a full component (16 percent). Some operations specifically
addressed M4R as an objective (13 percent). Monitoring and evaluation are steps in
an M4R system, but M4R’s main goal is for relevant actors to use the evidence base
and data produced by that system for adaptive management and learning. As

shown in figure 1.3, the least common aspect of client capacity addressed was
evidence-based decision making (including use for financing and budgeting).

The 49 percent of projects that specifically focused on client M4R were in 71
countries, including 29 FCV countries.16 Latin America and the Caribbean led all
regions in projects with one or more M4R elements (figure 1.4), and 51 percent of
IBRD operations addressed M4R compared with 42 percent of IDA projects. IEG also
found that 11 percent of advisory services and analytics (ASA) during FY13–15
supported countries’ M4R capacity, based on a review of the theme codes related to
M4R. This figure may be an underestimate, as advisory services with other theme
codes may have elements of M4R, although these are not likely to be significant.

Note: M4R = managing for results.

Neither the effectiveness of the M4R activities nor the resources devoted to them were
feasible to assess for this review because this information is not obvious from the
ICRRs. In the few projects that had M4R as an objective, IEG outcome ratings were
moderately satisfactory and higher.

IEG also found that among the 51 percent of the projects that did not address client
M4R, more than half (57 percent) identified it as an issue (lack of government
capacity, for example) in the PADs, project papers, or ICRRs. Furthermore, both the
PADs and the ICRRs in 17 percent of cases mentioned M4R as an issue. Additional
analysis of the project performance assessment reports posted in 2015 and 2016
found that lack of or weak M4R in the country were mentioned in 24 percent of
cases. The reasons why the World Bank did not address M4R in these cases is not
evident from the review. Potential reasons include lack of client demand, the
capacity was being addressed in other ways, or simply lack of attention to this issue.

IFC DEVELOPMENT OF CLIENT CAPACITY
IFC enhances client capacity for M4R primarily through advisory services, its
environmental and social (E&S) Performance Standards in Investment Services, dedicated
instruments such as corporate governance, and nonfinancial additionality support for
enhancements to management information systems, data systems, risk control systems,
M&E systems, and financial reporting systems.

IEG analysis of IFC M4R activities at the project level (appendix B) found that in the
recent cohort of IEG evaluated and validated IFC projects, 69 of the 81 investment
projects (85 percent) and 61 of the 71 advisory projects (86 percent) had M4R
characteristics. Appendix B describes the methodology for this analysis.

The review found that IFC’s management of results implementing E&S Performance
Standards was superior in its approach and execution compared with other M4R
tools at IFC, but IFC could further strengthen the approach for clients who
repeatedly default17 on lender terms (specifically on E&S Action Plan compliance).
In engaging with clients in IDA and middle-income countries, the IFC approach to
building capacity through E&S-related data systems was superior compared with
other M4R tools advocated at the project level.

Although IFC’s performance on E&S-related outcomes is positive and shows
improvement over the long term, IEG’s analysis (FY01–15) of clients’ E&S capacity
development (FY01–15) indicate that E&S performance has leveled off. It was noted
that since 2006, the clients were required to meet additional E&S requirements, such
as Labor and Working Conditions, under IFC’s Performance Standards that were
not included and monitored by IFC prior to 2006. IEG validations recommended
that to improve client capacity in this area, further emphasis is needed on
development and implementation of environmental and social management
systems, E&S monitoring and reporting and full implementation of all gaps
identified in Environmental and Social Action Plans (ESAPs) by the client. For
projects implemented through financial intermediaries, additional efforts are needed
on compliance verification of the subprojects’ Performance Standards, if they are
triggered.

IFC’s corporate governance advisory support can potentially be a cornerstone of
external M4R (capacity development for enhancing client results), but results so far are
mixed. IEG validations during this review period (particularly in Mongolia,
Mozambique, and Lebanon) highlight the client’s right intentions at approval to
enhance corporate governance systems and processes to manage for development
results, but the outcomes and impact achievements are mixed due to client capacity,
exogenous factors, and IFC work quality.

CHAPTER 1
MANAGING FOR RESULTS
Umbrella programs, such as corporate governance in Latin America and Asia, were
designed to strengthen the risk management and corporate governance policies and
procedures of IFC client financial institutions to make them more resilient to crises
and enhance their capacity to grow sustainably. The programs broadly achieved
their objectives. However, evidence from the projects also shows inconsistent client
implementation due to changing internal priorities and the lack of influence and a
hands-on approach from IFC in improving corporate governance or linking it to
potential investment opportunities.

Client data systems and beneficiary results are intrinsically linked. To meet
expectations on the results framework, IFC needs to scope such components in the
project design when feasible. Clients’ weak management information system
presents challenges to the further development of institutional capacity.

MIGA DEVELOPMENT OF CLIENT CAPACITY
MIGA has a limited role in client capacity development but an important role in the
development of the political risk insurance industry. MIGA’s guarantees are usually
only one element of a project’s financing and risk management package and are
often requested when the project design is complete or nearly complete and when
the project is close to financial closure.

On the E&S performance aspects (on which MIGA influences clients like IFC), all
MIGA-supported projects are reviewed at underwriting for capacity improvement
potential through the Performance Standards framework. Post-issuance, the project
company conducts an annual monitoring review and MIGA specialists validate it.
Appropriate course corrections and recommendations for strengthening results at
the client level are provided by the specialists based on the review. For example, in
the oil and gas industry project in Uzbekistan, the MIGA team helped solve critical
E&S issues by convening external industry experts.

MIGA also supports the industry through its reinsurance business, which in 2013
adjusted MIGA frameworks to allow use of reinsurance at shorter tenors compared
with those in its guarantee contracts. This change allowed MIGA to expand the
panel of facultative reinsurers it uses to optimize reinsurance capacity for larger,
longer-tenor projects that, in turn, facilitate scale-ups for MIGA clients.18

ADDRESSING M4R CAPACITY AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL
At the country level, IEG examined 40 country strategies that contained ratings by
objective to determine whether, and to what extent, the strategies incorporated
M4R.19 The review revealed that some objectives clearly indicated an intent to
manage for results—for example, “improve national statistical capacity” (Botswana)


20
                                                                              CHAPTER 1
                                                                   MANAGING FOR RESULTS
or “update and increase the quality of social demographic information and agriculture
data to better support decision making and the evaluation of public policies” (Bolivia).
The objectives were most often part of an effort to improve public sector management—
for example, “improved financial management, procurement, and results monitoring
and evaluation capacity” (Honduras). About half of the country strategies included at
least one M4R objective, and they collectively contained 32 M4R-related objectives.

The majority of country strategies in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region
(nine of 13) and the Middle East and North Africa Region (three of four) included
M4R objectives. However, fewer included M4R objects in the East Asia and Pacific
Region (one of two), Africa (three of nine), South Asia (one of three), and Europe
and Central Asia (two of nine).

Country strategies focused more on evidence-based policy making (13 objectives)
than on data systems (12 objectives) and performance-based budgeting (7
objectives). However, higher- and upper-middle–income countries were more likely
to pursue an objective related to evidence-based policy making or the use of data or
evidence in decision making. Not surprisingly, the nature of the objective differed
depending on the country circumstances and priorities. For example, “improving
citizen security” was a key focus of the Honduras country strategy, which included
support for developing municipal security plans that incorporated geo-referenced
crime statistics under the objective “strengthen capacities of communities and local
governments in social prevention of crime and violence.” Strengthening data
systems was more of a priority in lower-income countries.

Various World Bank instruments support M4R objectives. In Uruguay, the First and
Second Programmatic Public Sector, Competitiveness, and Social Inclusion
Development Policy Loans, and the Institution Building Technical Assistance Loan
supported the objective to “introduce performance oriented budgeting.” All three
loans included strengthening performance-based budgeting as part of a wider
program to improve government effectiveness.

However, the World Bank Group was not always successful in meeting its M4R
objectives. IEG assessed only 12 of the 32 M4R-oriented objectives as achieved or
mostly achieved. This is lower than the 51 percent average for all objectives. These
results are preliminary and with small numbers, but availability of a larger pool
would warrant a full assessment.

CHAPTER 1
MANAGING FOR RESULTS
BOTTOM LINE: THE WORLD BANK GROUP PUT RELATIVELY MORE EMPHASIS ON MEASUREMENT THAN ON
ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT, AND IT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A REVIEW OF ITS APPROACH TO CLIENT CAPACITY
This exploratory review presents an approximate baseline of the World Bank Group’s
efforts at strengthening client’s M4R capacity. The emphasis on data systems, monitoring,
and evaluation should be lauded for building the foundation for evidence-based decision
making. The review also underscores the potential for doing more in this area, as
indicated by cases that identified the need for strengthening client M4R capacity.
Individual project-based approaches may not yield the dividends expected by
themselves, and long-standing weaknesses recognized through years of staff experience
may require more broad-based solutions. This is especially important given that 53
percent of the World Bank’s commitments are rated high or substantial for institutional
risks, which includes the government’s capacity to achieve results (World Bank 2016u).
An assessment of the effectiveness of actions taken to date would help the World Bank
Group refine its approach to client M4R.


Conclusions
The World Bank Group has collectively addressed M4R with some success in the past 15
years, as have the individual institutions. Current evidence shows that efforts gave
priority to building a system of measurement. However, results measurement itself needs
further strengthening, particularly with respect to beneficiary-level results. Strengthening
adaptive management and learning using robust evidence also requires attention. Several
initiatives and reforms, and actions responding to recent IEG evaluations touching on this
topic, are already under way.

The World Bank Group supported client M4R capacity, particularly with respect to
measurement. However, more attention is needed to enable learning and use of
evidence for adaptive management (for example, for mid-course corrections in
programs). The World Bank Group is a demand-driven organization. However,
there may be space to address M4R strategically and practically from the supply side
as well. IFC and MIGA have strong potential to improve M4R for repeat clients and
in new products.

World Bank Group strategy and Forward Look (World Bank 2013, 2016a) both
strongly emphasize results and evidence. The World Bank Group thus may consider
a self-review of its M4R efforts (including all ongoing reforms and actions) to
develop a holistic and concrete action plan at the corporate, country, project, and
client levels with a view to its purposeful implementation. A review of several IEG
evaluations referenced that provide specific recommendations could help guide this

7The SMART criteria for setting objectives are specific, measureable, achieveable, realistic,
and time-based. Learning about the theory of change requires tracing key inputs, outputs,
and intermediate outcomes.
8Some World Bank Group services, such as advisory services and analytics, were not
systematically evaluated and are not reported in the scorecard.
9RAP 2015 found that “Indicators used in country strategies and projects were generally
inadequate to capture gender results. When present, indicators were narrow in scope and
tended to measure outputs instead of outcomes.” Although the analysis looked for PDO
indicators that captured gender gaps and their evolution, gender inequality measures, or
gender biases, few such indicators were found in use. More often, projects used core sector
indicators, numbers of female beneficiaries, or sex-disaggregated person-level project
indicators.
10The revised gender tag procotol, whose effect on operations remains to be seen, included
clarification of related guidelines. The new gender tag is required at Project Concept Note
Stage for all IBRD/IDA projects approved since July 2016. The new gender tag aims to
identify projects that are addressing (or can address) gender gaps identified in the Country
Partnership Framework, in a specific sector, or one of the four outcomes of the Gender
Strategy. Guidelines specify that for the project to be appropriately tagged, the Project
Appraisal Document must include a clear results chain linking gender gaps identified in
analysis, with actions to close them, and relevant indicators in the results framework.
11Private sector development rating is assigned to a subindicator under the overall
development outcome indicator in IFC investment projects.

17Thirty-two out of the 229 investment projects in the FY13-15 cohort were rated below
satisfactory on environmental and social (E&S) effects; 10 out of the 32 were rated
specifically for E&S Action Plan compliance shortcomings.
18 Facultativeinsurance is reinsurance for a single risk or a defined package of risks. The
ceding company (the primary insurer) is not compelled to submit these risks to the
reinsurer, but the reinsurer is not compelled to provide reinsurance protection, either.
19The World Bank Group outlines the various objectives it plans to achieve through its
country strategies and prepares a self-assessment at the end of the strategy period, the
Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR), or completion and learning review
(CLR). IEG validates the CASCR or CLR and provides a separate assessment (the CASCR or
CLR review). IEG has been rating the level of achievement for each objective since FY14,
providing insights into which objectives were met and which were not. Ratings are available
for 618 World Bank Group country objectives in 40 countries. This review examined the
CASCR and CLR reviews for these 40 countries to determine to what extent M4R was a factor
in the strategies and how the World Bank Group promoted M4R through its country
programs using the same framework as the projects’ analysis.

2. Recent Performance of World Bank Group
Operations
Highlights
 At 72 percent moderately satisfactory or above, World Bank project outcome ratings remained
   stable overall. Only a few projects with very large volume drove an increase in volume-weighted
   outcome ratings from 81 percent in FY10–12 to 87 percent in FY13–15.
 The South Asia Region and the Social Protection Global Practice had higher outcome ratings,
  compared with other regions and global practices.
 IFC development outcome success ratings continued the broader downward trend in outcomes
  since the financial crisis in 2008. Financial Institutions Group performance had a slight uptick
  from prior years, but other industries saw drops in success rates.
 IFC work quality and IFC net commitments to the projects are the primary drivers of project
  outcome ratings in the evaluated period, but limited data capture and insights on beneficiary-
  level results highlight a strand of weakness. IFC work quality success rate also declined.
 At 66 percent moderately satisfactory or above, country development outcome ratings in FY13–
  16 remained below the FY17 target of 70 percent. At 65 percent, country-level World Bank
  performance ratings also remained below the FY17 target of 75 percent.
 In regions other than Africa, most countries that had cycled through at least two country
  strategies during FY07–16 maintained a satisfactory development outcome rating, or improved
  from unsatisfactory to satisfactory. However, ratings remained unsatisfactory, or declined from
  satisfactory to unsatisfactory across country strategy cycles for a large group in Africa.



World Bank Group Commitments
World Bank Group commitments increased moderately from FY15 to FY16
(figure 2.1). IBRD lending increased from $23.5 billion in FY15 to $29.7 billion in
FY16, but IDA commitments decreased from $19 billion to $16.2 billion. The overall
number of projects approved per year has declined since FY14, a trend attributable
to a growing presence of large-volume projects from FY13 to FY16. During this time,
projects with commitment of $500 million or more rose from 20 percent of the total
volume of new commitments to 44 percent while constituting only 3 percent to 10
percent of the total number of new projects (appendix C, figure C.1).

Development policy financing (DPF) and Program-for-Results (P4R) led the overall
increase of lending commitment volume during FY15–16, but the volume of
investment project financing (IPF) decreased. DPF commitments rose from $9.2
billion to $14.7 billion, and P4R continued to expand from $2.2 billion to $7.0 billion,

and IPF commitments decreased from $30.5 billion to $23.8 billion. The number of
new DPF and IPF projects decreased, and the number of new P4R projects increased.
The average commitment per project for DPF increased from $164 million to $319
million, but dropped from $123 million to $109 million for IPF (appendix C, figure

IFC commitments in FY16 increased by 4 percent compared with the previous year
to reach $17.8 billion (long-term and short-term commitments combined). FY16 was
the second-best year for IFC in volume after FY13 ($18.4 billion). IFC’s long-term
commitments stood at $11.7 billion. Furthermore, IFC mobilized nearly $7 billion
from private capital sources.

MIGA issued $4.3 billion of guarantees in FY16 to support investors and help them
mitigate risk. Projects spanned all regions and sectors, and 59 percent of projects
were in at least one of MIGA’s four priority areas. At the end of the year, MIGA’s
outstanding gross exposure was $14.2 billion, of which 45 percent was in IDA-
eligible countries and 10 percent in fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV) countries.
Of this $14.2 billion, MIGA ceded $7.5 billion to its reinsurance partners.

The next sections discuss performance trends observed in three member institutions
of the World Bank Group. Findings should be interpreted with the understanding
that the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA differ in their operating models and in the time
frames generally applied to their projects. IFC investment projects are sampled,
evaluated, and reported for calendar year (CY). IFC Advisory Services and MIGA
projects are evaluated and reported on a fiscal year (FY) basis. Performance trends
below are measured by project ratings based on tightly structured review of
completion documents.

In this analysis, IEG mentions increases or decreases in ratings and other differences
across groups only if it found the difference to be statistically significant. However,
exceptions are in the MIGA discussion (MIGA has too few project ratings in a single
year), especially for a new product line (non-honoring guarantees), and in
appendixes I and J (the regional and global practice cluster updates).


World Bank Project Performance
The overall performance of World Bank projects improved moderately among
projects closed during the FY13–15 period. The percentage of projects with outcome
ratings of moderately satisfactory or above (MS+) remained essentially the same at
72 percent for FY13–15 and 70 percent for the FY10–12 period, below the corporate
target of 75 percent by FY17.1 Weighted by volume, the percent MS+ rose from
81 percent for FY10–12 to 87 percent for FY13–15, above the FY17 corporate target of
80 percent (see figure 2.2). IEG reported outcome ratings here for comparison with
past RAP reports; however, outcomes are not entirely within the World Bank’s
control. The World Bank performance rating, on the other hand, assesses the extent
to which services the World Bank provided ensured the operation’s quality and

supported effective implementation, elements that are within the World Bank’s
control. Figure 2.2 also includes this rating’s trend. The volume-weighted percentage
of projects with World Bank performance rated MS+ rose from 78 percent for FY10–
12 to 87 percent for FY13–15. In the future, IEG expects to determine the best way to
analyze and report outcomes and World Bank performance, based on ongoing
discussions regarding reforming the World Bank’s self-evaluation system and
incentivizing evidence-based learning.

Note: IEG rated 791 projects that closed in FY13–15 with a total net commitment (volume) of $77.3 billion, among which
697 were IPF projects with net commitment totaling $58 billion, and 80 were DPF projects with net commitment totaling
$18.6 billion. DPF = development policy financing; IPF= investment project financing; MS+ = moderately satisfactory or

                                    RECENT PERFORMANCE OF WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
The performance of a few projects with very large volume drove the increase in the
volume-weighted percent MS+. Among the FY13–15 group, 15 projects with net
commitment of $800 million or more accounted for 1.9 percent of the projects and
24 percent of the volume.2 IEG rated all 15 of these projects MS+ on outcome.
Among the FY10–12 group, 12 projects had a net commitment of $800 million or
more, accounting for 1.2 percent of projects and 17 percent of volume. IEG rated
11 of the 12 projects MS+ and the remaining project (P095205, with a net
commitment of $1.3 billion) unsatisfactory on outcome. Appendix C, table C.1 lists
projects with volumes of $800 million or more that closed during FY10–12 and
FY13–15.

IEG sorted countries by volume across projects closed in both the FY10–12 and the
FY13–15 groups, and 10 countries were in the top 50 percent of volume in either
group: India, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, China, Poland, Colombia, Vietnam,
and Argentina. Almost all are IBRD countries, and any volume-weighted percentage
reported is influenced by project performance in these countries. Appendix C
presents the project ratings over time for these 10 countries (all very large volume)
(figure C.3) as well as for the more than 100 countries that make up the bottom 50
percent of volume (figure C.4).

Project outcome ratings (percent MS+) for DPFs were higher than for IPFs in the
FY13–15 period when measured by number of projects, and in FY10–12 when
measured by commitment volume. Note, however, that the outcome rating
methodology differs. For IPFs, efficiency is one component of the outcome rating
(the others are relevance and efficacy), and for DPFs, only relevance and efficacy
inform the outcome rating. Volume-weighted outcome ratings for IPFs improved
from FY10–12 to FY13–15 (figure 2.3).

IBRD-funded operations had higher ratings than IDA projects as measured by
volume in both periods (FY10–12 and FY13–15). Volume-weighted outcome ratings
for IDA improved during the two periods. This pattern likely relates to the
observation that the few projects with very large volume received high ratings (and
especially so in FY13–15), and the average project volume for IDA increased from
$58.1 million in FY10–12 to $65.4 million in FY13–15.

Projects in FCV countries had lower outcome ratings (when weighted by volume)
than did projects in non-FCV countries, in both periods. For projects in both FCV
and non-FCV countries, volume-weighted outcome ratings increased from FY10–12
to FY13–15. Furthermore, the average size of projects in FCV situations increased
from net commitment of $38.4 million in FY10–12 to $45.9 million in FY13–15, and

OVERVIEW OF REGIONAL PERFORMANCE
Project performance in South Asia was higher than that in other regions in FY13–15
(82 percent rated MS+), similar to the performance reported in RAP 2015. Projects in
the Africa and the Middle East and North Africa Regions in the same period had
lower ratings than other regions. It is worth noting that this cohort of projects was
active during a time of massive political transition and violent conflict in many
countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The Africa Region also had lower
outcome ratings than other regions in FY10–12.3

percent of projects with outcome rated MS was about equal for the FY10–12 group and the FY13–15 group. indicates the
difference in ratings was significant across the two time periods for this region.

Both the South Asia and Africa Regions improved their M&E quality ratings from
FY10–12 to FY13–15 (figure 2.4).4 In South Asia, projects in the Social Protection and
Labor Global Practice and in the Health, Nutrition, and Population practice helped
drive this improvement. In Africa, projects in Water and in Health, Nutrition, and

OVERVIEW OF GLOBAL PRACTICE PERFORMANCE
Social Protection and Labor again ranked first among Global Practices during FY13–
15, with 90 percent of projects rated MS+ on outcome (figure 2.5), was the top Global
Practice in M&E quality, and ranked second in quality at entry and quality of
supervision (after Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management). RAP 2015 noted good
design, supervision, and attention to the evidence base as factors related to
performance of Social Protection and Labor projects.5

Note: The number of projects with IEG ratings in each period is in appendix J. indicates the difference in ratings was
significant across the two time periods for the Global Practice. The Poverty Global Practice is excluded from this figure
because there were fewer than ten projects with ratings across both periods. The one Poverty project that closed during
FY10–12 had a rating of MU. Among the 7 Poverty projects closed in FY13–15 with IEG ratings, 5 were rated MS+.

Other Global Practices with outcome ratings exceeding the corporate target of 75
percent by FY17 include Agriculture (79 percent), Macroeconomics and Fiscal
Management (82 percent), and Transport and ICT (79 percent). Agriculture and
Education saw improvements in percent MS+ from FY10–12 to FY13–15, mainly
driven by projects in the Africa Region. Governance, with 56 percent MS+ outcome
ratings (for projects closed in FY13–15) had lower ratings than other Global
Practices.

Previous IEG work supports the common-sense hypothesis that careful design,
attentive supervision, country capacity, and clearly articulating project logic are
important for achievement of outcomes.6 IEG’s RAP 2015 found that for IPFs, project
performance correlated with quality at entry, quality of supervision, M&E quality, and
project size (to a much lesser extent). However, it was the change in project size instead
of the initial project size drove performance (as measured by project outcome rating).
The underlying dynamic this suggests is that projects that perform well are more likely
to receive additional financing instead of project size driving performance.
Furthermore, projects in countries with larger population and higher Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings were associated with higher ratings.
Projects that were ever labeled a problem project and projects with more task team
leaders during the project were associated with lower ratings. IEG’s RAP 2014 found
that application of past lessons, effective risk mitigation, and well-articulated project
objectives and results frameworks were associated with higher ratings.

SHORTCOMINGS IN UNSATISFACTORY PROJECTS
A review of 41 projects rated moderately unsatisfactory or below (MU−) out of the
199 projects completed in FY15 with IEG ratings available as of September 7, 2016,
found that all projects showed evidence of significant, major, or severe shortcomings
in relevance, efficacy, or efficiency.7 Furthermore, most (61 percent) mentioned
significant, major, or severe shortcomings in all three elements.8 In 23 of the 41
ICRRs (more than half), the low rating also corresponded to inadequate evidence to
substantiate the outcome rating. For 18 out of these 23, the evidence presented in the
ICR was not sufficient to substantiate achievement of at least some objectives (that
is, efficacy), and five of those had insufficient evidence for all objectives (appendix D
provides more details).

GENDER INTEGRATION IN PROJECTS
A pilot analysis found that gender was an explicit part of the project development
objective (PDO) or at least one of its components in 38 percent of projects reviewed
for this analysis (60 of 156 projects).9 This is similar to the 43 percent finding in RAP
2015.10 Of the 60 projects, 48 of the projects (80 percent) reported some sex-
disaggregated or male- or female-specific indicators at some level in the ICR, or one
of the indicators was the share or percentage of female beneficiaries. Gender was an
explicit part of the PDO in 11 projects. Among these, 10 projects reported on gender
indicators at the PDO level in the ICR (appendix E provides more details).

Trends in Outcome Ratings for IFC Investment and Advisory Projects
Outcome ratings for IFC investment projects, at 54 percent, are down by
3 percentage points from the previous year and continue to trend downward
(figure 2.6) Among the four subindicators of development outcome, drop in success
rates was lowest for the indicator on environmental and social (E&S) effects. IFC
work quality and net commitment to projects were the primary drivers of
development outcomes (appendix F, table F.1).

Note: The graph represents the share of projects with development outcome rated mostly successful or higher on a three-

evaluation completion rate for investment projects is 99 percent.

Sub-Saharan Africa performed best among the regions in the review period while
the performance of the other five regions trended down (figure 2.7.) Projects in Sub-
Saharan Africa were backed by financially strong sponsors who could withstand the
market downturns. This cohort of projects was concentrated more on financial
institutions. IFC projects in the Middle East and North Africa Region had the biggest
drop in success rates for the review period compared with the prior three-year
average, plunging nearly 14 percentage points, driven by business planning failures
and unexpected regulatory interventions. IFC performance (work quality) in the
Middle East and North Africa Region also experienced significant drop, compared
with other regions. Four of the six regions experienced strong growth in IFC
profitability (that is, Investment Outcome), except for Latin America and the
Caribbean and East Asia and Pacific Regions.

Development outcome ratings for real sector projects dropped six percentage points,
and financial sector projects moved up by one percentage point.11 Greenfield projects
were not as successful as expansion projects, driven mainly by project business
success and IFC work quality (figure 2.8). The success rates of IDA (and IDA plus
non-IDA blended, 63 in total) projects showed a positive increase of 3 percent,
edging closer to the long-term IFC average. Projects with more than one IFC
instrument (loan and equity) performed better than loan-only and equity-only
projects on both development outcome and IFC performance. Performance of
equity-only projects (64 evaluated in the review period) reached a 10-year low.

Infrastructure and Natural Resources (INR). Project design, structuring, and
adverse external factors such as geopolitical instability, regulatory changes, and
commodity price fluctuations led to less-than-satisfactory development outcomes,
despite strong appraisal and structuring from IFC. The main lesson from this
portfolio subset is that teams should consider ex ante downstream assessments12
when structuring projects and factor for conservative estimates on business growth
and economic returns. IFC profitability was higher than the prior review period and
was the highest among the four industries.

Financial Institutions Group (FIG). There was an uptick in the performance of FIG
projects. In underperforming projects, teams identified overall risks to the outcomes,
but proposed mitigation mechanisms did not work as expected primarily due to
macroeconomic risks. Project appraisals validated by IEG indicate insufficient
scenario analyses and sensitivity tests (more than 50 percent in the cohort), so when
unexpected events happened, there was no contingency plan.

Manufacturing, Agribusiness, and Services (MAS). Supporting south-south
investments through engagement with repeat clients was a positive aspect for
projects in this cohort but performance was below the prior review period. Project
design assumptions for growth, regulatory support, and expected demand did not
match reality. This was particularly true for greenfield initiatives with project
sponsors in countries where the sponsor had limited experience, as was the case in
23 out of the 45 greenfield projects in the cohort. Market diversification strategies of
IFC clients made sense on paper, but project execution faltered because of poor
resource allocation or lack of adaptability in the target market.

Telecom, Media, Technology and Venture Investing (CTT). Development outcome
success rate of CTT projects continued to lag other industry groups at 40 percent.
This is in part due to IFC support in the post-crisis environment of 2008-2010 of
innovative business models and first-time fund managers. A significant portion of
these projects did not meet the market test, lacked the financial viability to fund
scale-up plans or develop sufficient project pipeline and exits. More than two-thirds
of the projects were rated less than satisfactory for project screening, appraisal, and
structuring aspects.

IFC Advisory Services. The development effectiveness success rating for IFC
Advisory Services slipped from 65 percent to 61 percent (three-year rolling average),
and is below the IFC Corporate Scorecard target of 65 percent.13 Marginal dips in
performance (3–5 percent) occurred across all performance indicators, most notably
on indicators of IFC role and contribution and the advisory interventions’ design

quality.14 Based on weights by funding levels for advisory projects, the three-year
rolling average success rate dropped from 70 percent to 67 percent.

IEG validations show evidence of postcompletion monitoring and assessment in a
few cases conducted by IFC in a purposefully sampled way. Nevertheless, little
information is available on the impacts of IFC delivery of advisory services on long-
term, sustainable private sector development. As IEG presented in the previous
chapter, IFC may be missing an opportunity to prove its value and capture the
impacts by not measuring the effects on client capacity and client results through
M&E and data capture. An emerging lesson on this aspect is to assess clients’
capacity regarding management information systems and information technology as
part of the M&E framework analysis.


Trends in Outcome Ratings for MIGA Projects
MIGA development outcomes. To account for MIGA’s entire evaluated portfolio, this
report takes into account projects that received a positive, negative and a No Opinion
Possible (NOP) rating.15 A rating of NOP implies that it is not possible to make
conclusions on the development effectiveness of the project evaluated. Seven projects in
the review period (FY10–15) were rated as NOP for development outcomes due to the
paucity of project performance data. Out of the seven projects that were rated NOP, four
had been cancelled and three remained active at the time the evaluation commenced.16
On a six-year rolling average basis, excluding projects rated NOP from the total
evaluated, development outcomes of MIGA projects remained nearly steady at 61
percent (figure 2.9a). This indicator, including NOP in the total of evaluated projects,
declined by 4 percent from the prior review period (FY09–14). MIGA self-evaluation and
IEG validation of three non-honoring guarantee projects showed mixed development
outcome results in the review period. One consistent finding is that the underwriting
methods, monitoring, and supervision of the project credit risk, obligor risk profile, and
overall performance reporting in self-evaluations need strengthening. Furthermore, IEG
suggests that MIGA assess the risk to development outcome at underwriting stage and in
self-evaluations explicitly.

MIGA Regional performance. In the recent three-year review period, the Middle East
and North Africa Region was the best performer (Figure 2.9b). East Asia and Pacific
and Latin America and the Caribbean Regions had no successful projects while the
South Asia Region had no evaluated projects in the review period. Europe and Central
Asia had relatively higher instances of projects rated as NOP mainly due to the paucity
of project performance data.

Note: Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding. Percentages are the share of MIGA projects during the
fiscal years that had a rating of mostly successful or above. A rating of No Opinion Possible is given when a development
indicator lacks appropriate and sufficient performance data at the obligor, project, or beneficiary level. In figure 2.9b, NA
denotes Not Applicable, i.e., no projects were evaluated or validated in the review period. See endnotes 15 and 16 for

Country-Level Performance
This section considers the performance of the World Bank Group’s strategy and
approach within each country as defined in the country partnership framework (CPF)
or the country assistance strategy (CAS), if the strategy started before implementation
of the CPF. As stated in the CPF section of the World Bank’s Open Knowledge
Repository, the CPF, prepared in collaboration with a member country and starting
from the country’s own vision of its development goals, “identifies the key objectives
and development results through which the World Bank Group intends to support a
member country in its efforts to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a
sustainable manner.”17 It includes a proposed package of investments and knowledge
services (covering the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA, as appropriate) needed to
implement the World Bank Group’s strategy. A CPF also draws on a systematic country
diagnostic and places greater emphasis on learning. Table 2.1 shows the number of
reviews during FY07–16.

Note: Total number of countries is based on the list of IBRD, IDA, and blend countries from Operations Policy and Country
Services Operational Policies 3.10, Appendix F (effective July 1, 2016). Six OECS countries were reviewed together. The
number of countries reviewed includes those that IEG reviewed, but without ratings. CAS = country assistance strategy;
CPF = country partnership framework; OECS = Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States.

World Bank Group country outcomes remain below the FY17 corporate target of
70 percent. Across the World Bank Group, IEG rated 66 percent of country programs
MS+ for development outcomes during FY13–16. IBRD countries continue to
perform above the corporate target, and IDA countries (which include IBRD-IDA
blend countries18) continue to perform below the target (figure 2.10). Ratings of FCV
countries fluctuate more, mostly because of the small number of countries rated in
each period, which ranges from three to eight. IEG used an average for the four-year
period because these ratings fluctuate annually, reflecting the variance in the
number of Country Assistance Strategy Completion Reports (CASCRs) and
completion and learning reviews (CLRs) reviewed across fiscal years.19

Note: Dotted lines represent the World Bank Group FY17 target of 70 percent. The numbers outside of the bars indicate the
total number of CLRs completed for countries in each region (the denominators for the percentages).
AFR = Sub-Saharan Africa; CLR = completion and learning review; EAP = East Asia and Pacific; ECA = Europe and Central
Asia; LCR = Latin America and the Caribbean; MNA = Middle East and North Africa; N = number of CLRs; SAR = South
Asia. Six OECS countries were reviewed together with a single rating.

East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the
Caribbean Regions show country development outcomes that exceed the corporate
target. IEG rated more than 70 percent of the country programs in these regions MS+
during FY07–16, which is at or above the corporate target (figure 2.11). Both the
Africa and Middle East and North Africa Regions performed below the corporate
target. In the more recent period, FY13–16, country development outcomes of the
Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and Europe and Central Asia Regions
is above the corporate target. It is important to note that the number of strategies
evaluated varies over time and between Regions and performance in a few countries
can affect overall performance.

IEG also found that during a period of two or more country strategy reviews,
CASCRs and CLRs for 17 countries in five World Bank regions (except for East Asia
and Pacific) improved from unsatisfactory to satisfactory. However, CASs and CLRs
for 12 countries in the Africa and Europe and Central Asia Regions declined from
satisfactory to unsatisfactory, and eight in Africa and three in other regions stayed at
the unsatisfactory level, primarily because country programs were too optimistic
(figure 2.12).

Note: AFR = Sub-Saharan Africa; CLR = completion and learning review; EAP = East Asia and Pacific; ECA = Europe and
Central Asia; LCR = Latin America and the Caribbean; MNA = Middle East and North Africa; MS+ = moderately satisfactory
or above; MU− = moderately unsatisfactory or below; SAR = South Asia. Six OECS countries were reviewed together with
one rating. Countries with consecutive MU− strategies are Bolivia, Djibouti, The Gambia, Honduras, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritania, Niger, Pakistan, Paraguay, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia.

At 66 percent, CLR review ratings of World Bank Group performance was below the
target of 75 percent good or better in FY13–16 (figure 2.13). While it was 78 percent
for FY07–10 and 76 percent for both FY08–11 and FY11–14, the performance was also
lower than the target in FY12–15 at 69 percent.20 Disaggregation by IBRD and IDA
countries shows that performance was below the World Bank Group’s target for
FY13–16 in both groups.21 Although performance in IBRD countries was above the
FY17 corporate target in some periods, performance in IDA countries remained
below the target, and the two converged in FY12–15 and FY13–16. The self-assessed
performance ratings are higher than IEG’s ratings—the World Bank Group’s self-
assessment was 90 percent for FY12–15 and 85 percent for FY13–16.22 The fluctuation
of IEG ratings over time reflects the variation in countries rated in each time period.
An examination of the most recent three periods (FY11–14, FY12–15, and FY13–16)
found that higher performance ratings are associated with stronger country
capacities, as measured by CPIA and other related indicators.23

Disaggregation by regions shows that East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central
Asia, Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia achieved ratings above or just
slightly below the corporate target of 75 percent for the review period FY07–16
(figure 2.14). However, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa were below
target at 69 percent and 62 percent, respectively. The difference between Africa and
other regions is statistically significant. In the more recent period, only Europe and
Central Asia and Middle East and North Africa are at or above the target.

IEG performed two sets of analyses to understand the factors affecting World Bank
Group country outcomes. First, IEG conducted a regression analysis to examine

                                     RECENT PERFORMANCE OF WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
which factors influence country development outcome ratings. Second, IEG
reviewed the objectives articulated in the strategies to determine whether the set of
objectives differs between countries with higher versus lower CPIA, given the
relationship between country capacity and country development outcomes.
Appendix G describes these analyses in more detail.

The regression analysis found that government capacity24 (as measured by the CPIA
rating), economic performance, per capita gross domestic product, World Bank
Group program size, and the country portfolio quality correlate significantly with
country development outcomes (statistically significant at the 5 percent). Among
World Bank Group factors, lending program size (as measured by the log of the total
number of ongoing projects at the start of the strategy period and projects approved
during the strategy period), and the IEG project outcomes rating (the percentage of
projects rated MS+ after project closing) were positively associated with country
development outcome ratings. The percentage of projects at risk correlated
negatively with the country development outcome ratings. Statistical significance
was weak for the correlations with project risk ratings and with IEG ratings of
project outcome—lending program size was statistically significant at the 5 percent
confidence level, and projects at risk and IEG project ratings were significant at the
10 percent confidence level (appendix G provides details). These findings show that
evidence on performance matters, but portfolio size may well be a proxy for the
World Bank’s capacity to manage the program. Analysis in RAP 2015 found that
country capacity (as measured through the CPIA rating) was associated with project
performance. The current analysis shows that it is also directly associated with
country strategy development outcome.

As noted at the beginning of this section, country development outcome ratings
assess the achievement of objectives in the country strategy, and project outcome
ratings assess the project development outcome only. However, a small correlation
exists between the two, as shown in table 2.2. Appendix H also contains a
disaggregation of CLRs by country development outcome rating and percent of
projects rated MS+ (figure H.1).

The World Bank Group engages in a wide range of activities in its country programs
that contribute to the objectives articulated in its country strategy. The World Bank
Group and IEG began rating the achievement of country strategy objectives and
using these ratings as the basis for determining the overall country development
outcome rating in FY14. IEG rated 618 objectives in 41 CASCR and CLR reviews
between FY14 and FY16.25

As part of the second analysis, IEG categorized these objectives by the newly defined
FY17 themes to analyze their achievement in different CPIA contexts, given that this
factor relates to country outcomes.26 Findings show that the overall composition of
thematic objectives is similar across lower and higher CPIA levels. The most frequently
observed objectives relate to: urban and rural development, public sector management,
environment and natural resource management, and human development and gender.
However, the share of objectives related to the urban and rural development theme is
larger in countries with lower CPIA scores (figure 2.15).

Overall, objectives in countries with higher CPIA scores are significantly more likely to
be achieved than those in countries with lower CPIA scores. This correlation is
generally not significant at the theme level due to smaller numbers. However, the
pattern of higher thematic achievement in higher CPIA countries remains, although the
achievement gap between higher and lower CPIA countries varies (figure 2.15). The
pattern suggests that objectives related to economic policy, finance, and environment
and natural resource management were relatively harder to achieve in countries with
lower CPIA ratings. Objectives related to public sector management were especially
difficult to achieve, regardless of CPIA (figure 2.15). Education-related objectives
contributed to lower ratings for the human development and gender theme in the
higher CPIA countries. This is a relatively small dataset that warrants additional
analysis as more objectives-level data become available.

Note: Analysis based on categorization of objectives reported in CLRs completed in FY14–16 into eight themes. A few
objectives corresponded to more than one theme. IEG categorized the CPIA score as lower or higher based on the median
CPIA scores of the end year of the CASCR periods for all countries in the sample. Higher CPIA scores are above the
median and lower CPIA scores are equal to or below the median score. Some percentages do not add up to 100 percent
because of rounding. CASCR = Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report; CLR = completion and learning review;
CPIA = Country Policy And Institutional Assessment.

Lack of realism (or being too ambitious) and deficiencies in results frameworks were
two main reasons for lower achievement of country objectives. A review of the 120
objectives rated as not achieved found that delays in the operation supporting the
objective or dropping it, operations taking longer than originally anticipated, and



                                                                                                                              45
CHAPTER 2
RECENT PERFORMANCE OF WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
weaknesses in the implementing agency accounted for 34 percent of the reasons for
objectives not being achieved. FY16 country strategy reviews found that many
programs were broad and lacked selectivity (too many objectives). About one-
quarter were ambitious relative to the government’s capacity, the political
environment for undertaking reforms, and agencies’ project implementation
capacity. Together, these reflect country teams’ lack of realism about what programs
could accomplish during the strategy period, given the operational inputs and
support (or lack thereof) for country capacity. Insufficient evidence was cited as a
reason for 23 percent of the objectives receiving ratings of not achieved (lack of
information or weaknesses in the results framework, such as lack of baselines and
targets), which made assessment difficult. Past IEG reviews identified similar issues
in several reports (for example, IEG 2012a, 2013b, 2014c, 2015m).27

The results framework and realism of country strategies (based on well-informed
risk-taking and understanding of country capacity) are areas in which IEG still sees
potential for improvement. Results frameworks and program design are linked, and
ambitious objectives need to be commensurately underpinned with operations that
can support that ambition. Most results frameworks did not accurately reflect IFC or
MIGA’s contributions. Capacity development provided often proved to be
inadequate. These shortcomings made it difficult to manage country programs and
assess the extent to which the programs met or were meeting World Bank Group
country objectives. This, in turn, affected IEG’s country development outcome
rating. This situation can continue across two consecutive strategies. Going forward,
ex ante assessment of risks using the relatively new Systematic Operational Risk
Rating tool, may provide improved information about the realism or relative
ambitiousness of country strategies.

Another step the World Bank Group could take to strengthen country program
management is to use the new CPF process and refocus on outcomes, results chains,
and strategy design at the performance and learning review stage. IEG’s review
found that the World Bank Group was not taking full advantage of the review stage
to reexamine these areas. For example, Colombia’s original strategy proved to be
unrealistic and the World Bank Group then curtailed the strategy accordingly
during the progress review period; in Bangladesh, a key project was canceled and
then the country program was adjusted accordingly. The results frameworks were
restructured to reflect these changes. However, most changes involve dropping or
adding objectives and indicators without necessarily strengthening the links
between the operational program and the outcomes expected. Going forward, the
World Bank Group should take full advantage of the performance and learning
review and strengthen the results framework as a country program adaptive
management tool. It can do this by reexamining the validity of the result chains to

determine if the ongoing or newly proposed interventions (including IFC and
MIGA’s) fully contribute to the planned objective and the country goal. It can also
reconsider the indicators and targets to ensure that indicators capture the expected
outcomes and are achievable within the country strategy’s remaining time frame.
The forthcoming IEG evaluation of SCD and CPF will analyze these issues in more
depth.


1 Data are based on 89 percent of ICR reviews completed for projects closed in FY15. See
figure C.2 in appendix C. Data includes ICRR ratings for all fiscal years and project
performance assessment report ratings through FY14.
2IEG chose the cutoff of $800 million because these projects represented 20 percent of the
total volume (net commitment) among projects closed during the six-year period (FY10–15)
that had IEG outcome ratings available as of August 2, 2016.
3Although outcome ratings for some Regions were higher (or lower) in FY13–15 than in
FY10–12, none of the increases or decreases were found to be statistically significant. As
noted earlier, the text in the main report mentions increases, decreases or other differences
only if they were found to be statistically significant.
4Although M&E quality ratings for some Regions were higher (or lower) in FY13–15 than in
FY10–12, not all the increases or decreases were found to be statistically significant. The two
where an increase was found are marked by a gray box around the name of the Region. As
noted earlier, the text in the main report mentions increases, decreases or other differences
only if they were found to be statistically significant.
5RAP 2015 noted the following factors related to relatively high ratings in Social Protection
and Labor: (1) many Social Protection and Labor projects are strongly evidence based and
have relatively high ratings for quality at entry; (2) relatively high ratings for quality of
supervision; (3) evaluation is often built into project design; and (4) relatively frequent use
of impact evaluations. RAP 2015 also noted that the Social Protection and Labor Global
Practice had effectively implemented recommendations from IEG’s evaluation of social
safety nets (IEG 2011b).
6Findings in previous IEG work are consistent with the study on factors affecting World
Bank project outcomes (Denizer, Kaufmann, and Kraay 2011). The authors also found
country capacity, project size, supervision cost, and problem project flag are correlated with
project outcomes.
7This analysis is based on a review of 199 ICR reviews for projects completed in FY15 for
which ratings were available as of September 7, 2016 (41 projects had ratings of moderately
unsatisfactory or below on outcome).
8The three adjectives (significant, major, and severe) are important because they are part of
the IEG and Operations Policy and Country Services harmonized guidelines for
determining an outcome rating. Part of the definition of each rating corresponds to the
presence or degree of shortcomings, as follows:




                                                                                                47
Moderately unsatisfactory: “There were significant shortcomings in the operation’s
achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance”
Unsatisfactory: “There were major shortcomings in the operation’s achievement of its
objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance”
Highly unsatisfactory: “There were severe shortcomings in the operation’s achievement of its
objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance.”
9IEG piloted an addition to the ICR review process in FY16 to include systematic
documentation of gender dimensions in individual projects. As part of the pilot, ICR
reviewers examined whether gender is a relevant aspect of the project and whether the ICR
reports sex-disaggregated or female- or male-specific indicators. The pilot extended the
analysis conducted for the 2015 Results and Performance of the World Bank Group (RAP) report,
and IEG conducted the pilot for 156 projects closed in FY15 with completed ICRRs.
10The analysis performed for RAP 2015, which IEG based on a review of project appraisal
documents instead of ICRs and used a different review instrument, examined (among other
elements) whether at least one of the actions or components planned as part of a project
integrated gender. The analysis found that 43 percent of the projects reviewed integrated
gender into one or more actions or components in the project.
11Financial sector refers to all projects evaluated by the Financial Institutions Group and
fund projects from the Venture Investing department with a focus in financial institutions.
All other projects are classified under the real sector.
12In FY17, IFC started piloting ex-ante assessments of downstream effects in power and
extractives sectors.
13   For FY15, Advisory Services evaluation completion rate was 97 percent.
14Indicator for Advisory Services work quality/design quality is not on three-year rolling
average since it was introduced after January 1, 2015.
15Out of 71 projects in the FY10–15 period, 7 projects were rated as No Opinion Possible
(NOP). The success % including NOP uses 71 as the N whereas the success % excluding
NOP uses 64 as the N for calculations. Out of 59 projects in the FY09-14 period, three
projects were rated as No Opinion Possible. The calculation for success % including NOP
uses 59 as the N whereas the success % excluding NOP uses 56 as the N. Out of 34 projects
in the FY13-15 period, seven projects were rated as No Opinion Possible. The success %
including NOP (FY13-15) uses 34 as the N whereas the success % excluding NOP uses 27 as
the N for calculations. Out of 29 projects in the FY12-14 period, three projects were rated as
No Opinion Possible. The success % including NOP uses 29 as the N whereas the success %
excluding NOP uses 26 as the N. In the regional performance analysis, South Asia region
had no evaluated projects in the review period. For Latin America and Caribbean region,
N=1 for calculating both success % excluding NOP and success % including NOP. For
Middle East and North Africa region N=2 for calculating both success % excluding NOP

 For this analysis, the following countries were categorized as IDA-IBRD blend during
18

FY13-16: Bolivia, Cabo Verde, Republic of Congo, Moldova, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New
Guinea, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, and Uzbekistan.
19For example, across the World Bank Group, 53 percent of 19 country programs were rated
moderately satisfactory or better in FY13, improving to 77 percent of 22 programs in FY14
and to 85 percent of 13 programs in FY15, but dropping to 55 percent of 20 programs in
FY16.
20The World Bank Group and IEG used a six-point ratings scale (highly satisfactory,
satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory) for World
Bank Group performance until 2013, when a four-point scale was implemented (superior,
good, fair, and poor). For simplicity, “good” and “superior” ratings are considered
equivalent to “moderately satisfactory or better” (highly satisfactory, satisfactory, and
moderately satisfactory) for this report.
21Further analysis of factors of achievement of CAS objectives and country development
outcome ratings is presented in paragraphs 2.41 through 2.49.
22All Country Assistance Strategy Completion Reports (CASCRs) and completion and
learning reviews (CLRs) began rating World Bank Group performance in FY12. Although
some rated performance before FY12, the numbers are limited and are not comparable.




                                                                                              49
23Other country-level factors include annual GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, Human
Development Index score, and the Worldwide Governance Indicators on government
effectiveness and regulatory quality.
24Government capacity affects country development outcomes directly and also indirectly
through project outcomes. The impact of country capacity on project outcomes is widely
recognized, as seen in two studies (Denizer, Kaufmann, and Kraay 2011; Moll, Geli, and
Saavedra 2015).
25FY14 was a transition year in which eight of the 20 CASCR reviews rated objectives. Haiti
(FY16) had separate assessments for the CAS and interim strategy note and counts as two
country programs, bringing the total number of CASCRs and CLRs reviews to 41.
26 The World Bank Group adjusted its themes in July 2016, and IEG used the new themes for
this analysis. The objectives reflect the themes to which they are mapped. For example,
“increase access to sanitation services” (Uzbekistan) is included under Urban and Rural
Development; “improve the financial stability of the health sector” (Montenegro) is under
Human Development and Gender, and “increased access to electricity” (multiple countries)
is under Environment and Natural Resource Management (which includes Energy).
27IEG (2014c) observed a decline in country development outcomes during FY06–13 and
attributed it to portfolio deterioration, deficient results frameworks, and the global food,
fuel, and financial crisis and the international recession afterward.

3. Management Action Record
The purpose of IEG evaluations is to help the World Bank Group achieve
development results by supporting evidence-based adaptive management and
learning. To this end, IEG and management of the World Bank Group institutions
established the Management Action Record (MAR) to track the implementation of
management actions in response to IEG recommendations. The MAR also fulfills
accountability by informing the Board’s Committee on Development Effectiveness
and the public about progress on management actions. In addition, the MAR
provides an opportunity to reflect how the World Bank Group has learned from
evaluations and incorporated this learning in its work. This chapter describes the
annual MAR follow-up process and its implementation in FY16.


Tracking the Implementation of IEG Recommendations
IEG has tracked implementation of its recommendations since the late 1990s for the
World Bank and since early 2000s for IFC and MIGA. Since 2013, the management of
the World Bank Group institutions has provided detailed action plans with baselines,
targets, and indicators in response to IEG recommendations, against which both IEG
and management assess implementation progress. A pilot is also under way to assess
progress against the objectives of IEG’s recommendations rather than specific action
plans and actions.

The MAR tracks only those recommendations that are agreed or partially agreed
upon by management of the World Bank Group institutions. For recommendations
that are accepted, management creates an action plan for implementation. The
implementation for each agreed recommendation is independently assessed by
management and IEG for four years, after which the recommendation is “retired”
from the MAR review process. The analysis in this chapter is based on ratings and
reviews of FY16 implementation progress, previous RAPs, and focus groups
conducted to understand the impact from the four evaluations retiring from the MAR
update cycle.


Status of Bank Group Implementation of IEG Recommendations
In 2016, IEG tracked actions for 150 recommendations across all three Bank Group
institutions drawn from the 26 evaluations produced between FY12 and FY15.1




                                                                                       51
CHAPTER 3
MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD
Consistent with previous years, management self-rating of implementation progress
is higher than that of IEG. The disconnect in ratings is usually larger in the first two
years of implementation as management assesses progress at the early
implementation stage more positively than IEG does (figure 3.1). IEG often points to
the need for more work to have been completed or greater results to have been
achieved. This trend leads management to retire recommendations from the
implementation cycle earlier than IEG does and often before the end of the fourth
year, which explains the differences in the recommendation totals shown in the
figure.

For evaluations in the fourth year of review, IEG rates implementation progress as
substantial or higher for 72 percent of recommendations. The ratings are slightly
higher for recommendations reviewed both by IEG and management, where IEG’s
rating is at 77 percent substantial or higher. This is lower than IEG’s ratings of 81
percent for 2015, 83 percent for 2014, and 90 percent for 2013.

Multiple evaluations make similar recommendations, which suggests common
challenges and opportunities for the World Bank Group. About a third of the IEG
recommendations active in this year’s update focus on capacity building, slightly
less than a third on M&E, and approximately one-fifth on the World Bank Group’s
strategic directions and approaches (figure 3.2). Recommendations related to
capacity building focused more on building internal Bank Group capacity (21
percent) than on building client capacity (about 11 percent). These recommendations
generally highlighted the need to enhance staff skills, ensure adequate internal
knowledge transfer, and better understand country context and demands.

 Recommendations focused on M&E show the largest disconnect in the
implementation ratings between IEG and management in year four (figure 3.3). This
is a recurring trend in MAR updates and previous RAPs.

 in Year Four

In the past few years, recommendations related to M&E evolved to focus more on
learning from results and on client-related issues such as country ownership, capacity,
and context. For instance, one recommendation in World Bank Group Support to
Electricity Access proposed the following (IEG 2015q): “Across country clients,
promote uniformity and comparability in indicators, and help improve country
capacity for designing, implementing, and utilizing the M&E frameworks.” Another
example is from IEG’s evaluation Knowledge Based Country Program: “The Bank should
ensure and monitor high-quality results frameworks that respond to client concerns,
and link more tightly knowledge services tasks with country partnership strategies
milestones and outcome indicators.” (IEG 2016f, xxxii)

Further analysis shows that IEG’s M&E-related recommendations also shifted to
suggesting more complex approaches. An example is the IEG recommendations


                                                                                     53
CHAPTER 3
MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD
from the Biennial Report on Operations Evaluation: Assessing the Monitoring and
Evaluation Systems of IFC and MIGA (IEG 2008, 2013a). In 2008, IEG recommended
that IFC “consider developing more robust and consistent metrics for monitoring
and assessing its additionality and development impact at the sector and country
levels as IFC transitions to a more programmatic approach to interventions” (IEG
2008, xiii). In 2013, it recommended “self-evaluation system to ensure projects are
sufficiently mature to assess more meaningfully their development results. In doing
so, IFC might either consider conducting self-evaluation two to three years post
completion, possibly on a sample of projects as done for XPSRs, or launching a post
completion system based on clear selection criteria for projects to be included” (IEG
2008, p. xl). In addition, IEG recommended to “streamline the project-evaluation
approach and process to align more closely with MIGA’s business model and
conditions on data gathering.”

In addition, among 150 recommendations reviewed in this year’s cycle, management
only partially agreed with about 13 percent. For such recommendations, and in
some cases even for recommendations that were fully agreed on, the management
action plan did not fully encompass the spirit of IEG’s recommendation and thus not
all actions taken were in line with IEG’s original intent. Over one-third (36 percent)
of the partially agreed recommendations focus on internal capacity building and
M&E. Although it is a small number, analysis of management responses found that
the partially agreed recommendations most often cited feasibility of implementation
and the World Bank’s internal capacity, including time and budget, as main
constraints for full implementation. For instance, in response to IEG’s
recommendation in Knowledge-Based Country Programs seeking better staff incentives
and a balanced financial and budget framework between lending and knowledge
activities, management highlighted its commitment to achieve excellence in
knowledge services, but could not commit to specific budget allocation principles, at
the time when the entire budget process is being reviewed to align it to the new
World Bank Group strategy under development. Another example is the
recommendation made in Poverty Focus of Country Programs: Lessons from World Bank
Experience, which called for attention at project inception to evaluability.
Management agreed with the thrust of the recommendations to strengthen project
M&E frameworks, but found the specific remedies suggested hard or impractical to
translate into monitorable actions given project complexities.


IEG Recommendations on M4R
Of the 277 recommendations adopted since 2008, including 150 tracked this year,
34 percent had an M4R dimension that related to either capacity development or


54
                                                                                                   CHAPTER 3
                                                                                    MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD
M&E.2 The most common management actions in response to M4R
recommendations were improving country statistical capacity, introducing core
sector indicators, strengthening Bank Group M&E, and incorporating evidence-
based knowledge work into project design.

Of the retired and active fourth year recommendations adopted since 2008 that have
one or more M4R dimensions, IEG rated 68 percent substantial, high, or completed.
This is lower than the 77 percent implementation rate for all recommendations after
four years. A large proportion (62 percent) of M4R recommendations focused on
M&E, but as mentioned above, management and IEG most often disagree regarding
the implementation success of these recommendations.

An example of such disagreement is implementation ratings of recommendations
from IEG’s review of impact evaluations, which were rated substantial and above by
management 100 percent of the time over the past four years, while IEG rated
progress substantial and above only 60–75 percent of the time in the first three years
of implementation. However, neither IEG nor management rated them complete by
the fourth year (box 3.1).


 Box 3.1. Using Impact Evaluations for Better Development Results: The Road Ahead
 Impact evaluations are now widely used to better understand the results of development
 interventions and establish counterfactuals. Implementation of the recommendations from the
 evaluation on the Relevance and Effectiveness of World Bank Group Impact Evaluations acknowledges
 achievements by the World Bank Group in impact evaluation, including the critical role of
 development impact evaluation (DIME) in coordinating work across World Bank Group units and
 the work of hubs, such as i2i, SIEF, and the Africa Gender Innovation Lab, to integrate impact
 evaluation into project designs and reviews.
 Nonetheless, the systematic use of impact evaluations for project design and policy advice remains
 to be improved. Much of the funding for impact evaluation still comes through external funds that
 are not consolidated. Most project-supported impact evaluations depend on the resourcefulness of
 project leads to find external funds and no actions have been taken to streamline impact evaluation
 budgets within the general budget of the World Bank Group. This funding approach, and lack of
 coordination among impact evaluation hubs, leads to a less than strategic approach to the
 identification of key learning gaps where such evaluations could be strategically deployed.

Influence of IEG Recommendations
Evidence is a key input for adaptive management and learning, and IEG plays a role
in the World Bank Group’s M4R by providing knowledge based on evaluations. To



                                                                                                                      55
CHAPTER 3
MANAGEMENT ACTION RECORD
better understand how IEG’s recommendations may have influenced the World
Bank Group’s operational work and learning in the past four years, IEG conducted
eight focus groups targeting IEG and management representatives working on the
studies retiring from the MAR update cycle in 2016.3

The focus group discussions revealed that IEG recommendations are most influential
when they are first discussed with Bank Group counterparts and the Board of
Directors. Participants acknowledged that IEG studies helped catalyze discussions on
specific issues and provided space for building knowledge on a given topic. Usually in
response to IEG evaluations, management committed more budget and time to learn
and gather evidence on a theme. For instance, IFC representatives acknowledged that
IEG’s evaluation Assessing IFC’s Poverty Focus and Results (IEG 2011a) led to a much-
needed review of the literature on poverty issues and how IFC should incorporate
poverty in its strategy and operational discussions. Focus group participants also
mentioned that these changes were also due to the new requirements to understand
the twin goals and how they would translate into IFC’s operational work.


Using the MAR for Adaptive Management and Learning
Since the MAR update process focuses strictly on the achievements related to targets
and indicators outlined in management action plans, some actions may not be
relevant or necessary several years after implementation starts. Therefore, in FY16
IEG and its Bank Group counterparts agreed to implement several pilots to make the
MAR process itself more adaptable to help achieve the results intended by the
recommendations rather than the implementation of specific actions.

One of the pilot initiatives requires IEG and management to treat action plans for
Report on Self-Evaluation Systems (ROSES) and Learning and Results in World Bank
Operations: Toward a New Learning Strategy (Phase II) in an adaptive manner to allow
modifications to implementation throughout four years to account for changing
development needs and the World Bank Group context. These pilots aim to shift the
focus of implementation—and of the update process—to the achievement of the
outcomes intended by the recommendation, rather than focusing on the achievement
of targets set up by the action plan several years earlier. Progress on this initiative will
be analyzed and reported to the Board by the end of FY17.


Conclusion
IEG’s progress rating for FY16, although lower than in previous years,
acknowledges the steps taken by the World Bank Group toward achieving

development goals. More work needs to be done to address IEG recommendations
focused on M4R, including M&E, particularly as the World Bank Group aims to
better integrate results data in its decision-making processes


1Implementation of each recommendation is tracked and recorded over four years, with
Management of the World Bank Group and IEG making their own assessments using a five-
point scale of ratings: negligible, moderate, substantial, high, and complete. Ratings for
FY12 recommendations are available for four years, while those of the FY15
recommendations are only available for one year, accounting for the difference in number of
ratings for each year in figure 3.1.
2Analysis focused on 277 recommendations from 44 evaluations developed since 2008 to
determine whether they incorporated an M4R dimension, including: (i) strengthening
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in countries; (ii) improving M&E within the World Bank
Group; and (iii) using evidence for decision making. Among the recommendations, 34
percent included at least one M4R dimension. Improving M&E within the World Bank
Group accounted for just under two-thirds (62 percent) of the M4R dimensions while
country M&E and evidence-based decision making accounted for 18 percent and 19 percent
respectively. Some recommendations were the same for World Bank, IFC, and MIGA, thus
the total number of unique recommendations with an M4R aspect was 81 (29 percent).
3The studies retiring in the 2016 MAR update are the following: World Bank Country-Level
Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption; World Bank Progress in Harmonization and
Alignment in Low-Income Countries; The World Bank Group Impact Evaluations: Relevance and
Effectiveness; and Assessing IFC's Poverty Focus and Results. The focus groups were conducted
for three of the four studies because the relevant parties were not available for the
discussions on Progress in Harmonization and Alignment in Low-Income Countries.

Appendix B. Methodology for Client Support
Portfolio Review
1.     As part of the 2016 Results and Performance of the World Bank Group (RAP)
report, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) conducted an exploratory study to
assess the degree to which the World Bank Group supported M4R through its
projects. The analysis recognizes that World Bank operations are demand-based,
and demand for M4R may depend largely on countries’ incentives and on
institutional arrangements that might support or inhibit M4R.

Selection of ICRRs for Client M4R Review for World Bank Projects
2.          IEG selected the ICRRs of 347 projects for review, including:

           215 projects closed in FY14 and posted an ICRR as of July 20, 2016, and 50
            closed in FY15 and posted an ICRR as of May 15, 2016 for a total of 265
            projects closed in FY14 and FY15.
           82 recipient-executed trust funds (RETFs) operations that closed during
            FY13–15 and posted an ICRR as of July 20, 2016.1 A longer timeframe was
            selected for RETFs due to their smaller numbers in the portfolio.

Identifying M4R and Coding for Review
4.      The ICRR dataset includes a rich set of information regarding project design,
implementation, and results. The review comprised reading through the ICRRs and
classifying project objectives, components, and activities into the following key



68
                                                                           APPENDIX B
                                       METHODOLOGY FOR CLIENT SUPPORT PORTFOLIO REVIEW
elements through which the M4R principles are operationalized in World Bank
operations:

       Data systems: Key words include data, statistics, statistical capacity,
        information systems, information and technology systems, poverty data.
       Monitoring: Examples of keywords used include monitoring systems,
        monitoring, performance measurement, performance management,
        performance information, results management. (The Organisation for
        Economic Co-operation and Development defines monitoring as “A
        continuing function that uses systematic collection of data on specified
        indicators to provide management and the main stakeholders of an ongoing
        development intervention with indications of the extent of progress and
        achievement of objectives and progress in the use of allocated funds.”
        [OECD-DAC 2002, 28]).
       Evaluation: Key words included evaluation, impact evaluation, evidence,
        improve performance, mid-term review, among others. (The OECD defines
        evaluation as “The systematic and objective assessment of an ongoing or
        completed project, program, or policy, its design, implementation, and
        results.” [OECD-DAC 2002, 21-22]).
       Evidence-based program/policy: Examples of key words included use of
        evidence, use of results, feeding back information into decision-making,
        policy.
       Results- and performance-based budgeting. Examples of keywords used to
        search for this element include performance-based budgeting, results-based
        budgeting, performance-based allocation, and results-informed budgeting.
        (Robinson and Brumby 2005 provides an exposition of these related
        concepts.)
       Results- and performance-based financing. Examples of keywords used to
        search for this element include strengthening efficiency, institutional
        performance of the government or sector, results-based financing
        agreements, results-based grants, among others. Fritsche and others (2014)
        define performance-based financing as pay-for-performance programs.

5.     IEG first reviewed the 347 ICRRs to classify operations based on whether they
addressed M4R, using the key words to find the appropriate sections and
paragraphs to review. An operation addressed M4R if it met the following two
conditions:

       Projects included one or more M4R elements as part of their design (data
        systems, monitoring, evaluation, evidence-based policy or program, results-

          or performance-based budgeting, results- or performance-based financing,)
          as a project component, subcomponent, or activity.
         IEG sought to identify through information in the ICRR that the M4R
          component, subcomponent, or activity was directed at strengthening the
          country’s capacity at the sectoral or cross-sectoral levels. Therefore, IEG did
          not include in the “M4R” category projects that had an M4R component,
          subcomponent, or activity with the primary purpose of the project itself,
          including monitoring and evaluating project outputs or outcomes.

6.     To reduce errors of omission, the review included projects in the M4R
category, if the difference between project M4R (most often its M&E) and its support
to strengthening the country’s M4R capacity at the sectoral and cross-sectoral level
was not clear from reading the ICRR.

7.     Furthermore, projects with the following theme codes were automatically
included: managing for development results (90), economic statistics, modeling, and
forecasting (22), and poverty strategy, analysis, and monitoring (53). IEG excluded
four projects because of possible errors in theme code classifications.

8.     Of the 347 operations reviewed, IEG coded 169 operations as having
addressed client M4R capacity at the sectoral and cross-sectoral levels (table B.3).

9.    Once IEG classified an operation as an M4R operation, based on reading
through the ICRR and identifying M4R elements in the project, a rich set of variables
was coded:

         the extent of the M4R coverage: entire project (all components, one or some
          components of the project, or an activity or subactivity within a component);
         which M4R element was included in the project (results-based budgeting,
          results-based financing, data systems, evidence-based program or policy,
          data systems, monitoring, and evaluation);
         what type of capacity the project strengthened; institutional and legal
          frameworks, organizational and systems development, or human resources
          development; and

                                           METHODOLOGY FOR CLIENT SUPPORT PORTFOLIO REVIEW
       whether the risk to development outcome or lessons learned sections of the
        ICRR mentioned M4R as an issue (problems such as lack of government
        capacity, no information or data systems in place, among others).

Limitations
10.    IEG based the review on the ICRRs and did not review other World Bank
documents. Therefore, it is possible that some projects that addressed client M4R but
did not include the information in the ICRRs were not in the group reviewed.
However, as clarified previously, IEG reduced errors of omission by including
projects in its sample in which the difference between project M&E and
strengthening the country’s M4R capacity at the sectoral and cross-sectoral levels
was not clear from reading the ICRR.

Analysis of Operations Not Addressing Client M4R
11.    From the 178 operations classified as non-M4R operations, IEG conducted an
additional analysis of 139 IBRD and IDA operations. The analysis did not include
recipient-executed trust funds. IEG dropped 15 of the 139 operations because project
documents were not available. Therefore, the final non-M4R analysis included 124
IBRD/IDA operations.

12.    The analysis reviewed whether the project appraisal documents (PADs),
project papers, and ICRRs mentioned M4R issues, defined as low government
capacity in any M4R component, lack of any of the M4R systems, and lack of
political support to advance M4R reform, among others.

13.    The sections of PADs and project papers reviewed included the country
context, sectoral and institutional context, and lessons learned and reflected in the
project design. In the ICRRs, IEG reviewed the rationale for risk to development
outcome rating; M&E design, implementation, and utilization; and lessons sections.

14.     The second part of the analysis included project performance assessment
reports (PPARs). IEG reviewed 54 PPARs, 26 of which posted in 2015 and 28 posted
in 2016 (as of July 18, 2016). IEG used the same methodology as the one used for
classifying projects as “M4R” and categorizing their M4R elements.

Selection of World Bank Advisory Services and Analytics
15.    IEG considered advisory services and analytics activities addressing client
M4R capacity if they contained the following World Bank theme codes: managing
for development results (90), economic statistics, modeling and forecasting (22) and
poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring (53). Among the 3,640 advisory services

and analytics activities completed between FY13 and FY15 as identified through a
Business Intelligence report as of August 18, 2016, IEG determined that 407 activities
addressed M4R (table B.4).

IFC M4R Analysis

IFC M4R Methodology and Results
16.    Corporate-level M4R. Managing data systems and related process and tools
to enhance results framework and reporting of performance is corporate-level M4R.
The following methodology was adopted for the analysis:

             Assess the cascading of targets and indicators from corporate to department
              to project level.
             Review the adaptive management for IFC Development Goals and their flow
              into the Corporate Scorecards.
             Identify the data collection methods and use of core sector indicators (degree
              and intensity).

          ◦     Observations on degree and intensity
          ◦     Observations on absolute values, percentages, and relative values
          ◦     Observations on verifiability, auditability, and timeliness of monitoring
                results.

17.    Client and beneficiary-level M4R. Capacity development through IFC
additionality in enhancing systems, tools, and processes for capturing development
results is defined as the client and beneficiary-level M4R (table B.5). The
methodology adopted is as follows:

             Assess ratings on Expanded Project Supervision Reports (XPSRs) and project
              completion reports with an emphasis on IFC nonfinancial additionality.
             Identify seven components that adhered M4R principles.

METHODOLOGY FOR CLIENT SUPPORT PORTFOLIO REVIEW

IFC Ratings Variance across Three Ratings Systems
21.    IEG analyzed the ratings variance across the Development Outcome Tracking
System (DOTS), XPSRs, and IEG validations. DOTS ratings are based on the entire
portfolio of active clients as opposed to a sample (which is the case for XPSRs);
DOTS ratings are client-based, as opposed to project-based in XPSRs; DOTS ratings
are updated annually, capturing changes in performance over time while an XPSR
takes a snap shot of the project once in its life. IEG validations are undertaken
following the XPSR and are conducted once in the life of the project.

22.    IEG assessment indicates that the variance between DOTS and IEG ratings, as
indicated by the disconnect rate was 19 percent in FY13, 6 percent in FY14, and 14
percent in FY15. The disconnect was contributed by lowered IEG ratings for all
subindicators except Economic Sustainability. Though moderate, the review also
suggested that DOTS (as an M4R system) was not completely updated for the
portfolio to reflect project-level outcomes. Among all the subindicators, the DOTS
ratings for project business success showed the largest divergence from IEG ratings.
The validation of E&S effects had the least variance across the three systems, showing
the highest degree of alignment. The breadth of the gap between XPSR and IEG
ratings was consistent during the three years (table B.14).

subindicator than the other subindicators, showing a higher degree of alignment.

24.     The XPSR overall development outcome ratings had higher success rates in
FY14 and FY15 by 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively, but 3 percent lower than
DOTS in FY13 (table B.15). The variance band was moderate. The project business
success indicator had a large gap of 28 percent between DOTS and XPSR in FY14,
again raising the question of whether DOTS was updated. The second biggest gap
was in the economic sustainability indicator (12 percent in two years). The E&S
effects indicator had the least variance between DOTS and XPSR, from 3 percent to 8
percent.

Appendix D. Methodology for Review of World
Bank Projects with Below-the-Line Ratings
1.      IEG reviewed 199 ICRRs for World Bank projects completed in FY15 for
which IEG ratings were available as of September 7, 2016. Among these, 158 had
project outcome ratings of moderately satisfactory or above (MS+, or above the line),
and 41 had project outcome ratings of moderately unsatisfactory or below (MU −, or
below the line). IEG conducted a further review of the 41 projects with below-the-
line ratings, focusing on the following sections of the ICRR:

            Relevance
            Efficacy
            Efficiency
            Outcome
            Reason for difference in ratings between the ICR and IEG’s ICRR.

2.     IEG reviewed relevant text from these 41 ICRRs and coded it using the
following categories (which were not mutually exclusive):

            The low rating (MU−) corresponded to evidence of significant, major, or
             severe shortcomings related to the following:

         ◦     Relevance: both overall and related to relevance of design (35 ICRRs)
         ◦     Efficacy: including the number of project development objectives (PDOs)
               achieved versus not achieved (32 ICRRs)
         ◦     Efficiency (36 ICRRs)

            The low rating (MU−) corresponded to a lack of evidence related to the
             following:

         ◦     Relevance (0 ICRRs)
         ◦     Efficacy: including the number of PDOs with insufficient or inadequate
               evidence (18 ICRRs)
         ◦     Efficiency (3 ICRRs)
         ◦     Overall: inadequate evidence was mentioned as a reason for a downgrade
               in general and not specific to efficacy or efficiency (3 ICRRs)

            The 13 ICRRs whose MU− outcome rating from IEG was lower than the
             outcome rating the ICR assigned were coded to indicate the following reason
             for the difference, as follows:


85
                                                                                       APPENDIX D
                                                          ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON IFC PORTFOLIO
         ◦     Lower rating assigned because the ICR did not present sufficient evidence
               (13 ICRRs)
         ◦     Lower rating assigned because the ICR did not follow the harmonized
               guidelines correctly (0 ICRRs)
         ◦     Lower rating assigned for another reason (0 ICRRs)

3.       IEG used these categories to summarize the results reported (figure D.1).

4.     All 41 of the MU− projects reviewed showed evidence of significant, major, or
severe shortcomings in relevance, efficacy, or efficiency, and most (61 percent)
mentioned significant, major, or severe shortcomings in all three elements. The three
adjectives (significant, major, and severe) are important because they are part of IEG
and Operations Policy and Country Services harmonized guidelines for determining
an outcome rating. Part of the definition of each rating corresponds to the presence
or degree of shortcomings, as follows:

            Moderately unsatisfactory: “There were significant shortcomings in the
             operation’s achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance.”
            Unsatisfactory: “There were major shortcomings in the operation’s
             achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance.”
            Highly unsatisfactory: “There were severe shortcomings in the operation’s
             achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance.”

5.      In 23 of the 41 ICRRs, the low rating also corresponded to inadequate
evidence to substantiate the outcome rating. For 18 of these 23 (78 percent), the
evidence presented in the ICR was not sufficient to substantiate achievement of at
least some PDOs (that is, efficacy), and five of those had insufficient evidence for all
PDOs.

6.      The IEG-assigned outcome rating agreed with the outcome rating the ICR
assigned in 28 of 41 below-the-line ICRRs (figure D1.) IEG reviewed the reasons for
the difference in ratings in the other 13 downgraded projects and found that in all
cases, the reason for the downgrade was that the evidence presented in the ICR was
insufficient to justify an MS rating. (In all 13 of these downgraded projects, the ICRR
also found efficacy or efficiency shortcomings and evidence of those shortcomings.)
Furthermore, 10 of these 13 also mentioned shortcomings in relevance of design, an
ICRR rating category that assesses the project results chain’s coherence (that is,
delineating how the project inputs and activities were envisioned to lead to outputs
and desired development outcomes). For these 10 projects, IEG rated the relevance
of design as modest, which suggests that ambiguity in the project’s results chain can
inhibit collection of adequate evidence of project outcomes.

METHODOLOGY FOR REVIEW OF WORLD BANK PROJECTS WITH BELOW-THE-LINE RATINGS

 Figure D.1. All ICRRs of projects with below-the-line ratings mentioned significant, major, or
 severe shortcomings (with evidence) in at least one of relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, and
 most (61 percent) mentioned shortcomings in all three.

                                                        = Downgraded, with shortcomings and inadequate evidence

Source: IEG analysis.
Note: Among the 41 ICRRs that rated below the line, 25 (or 61 percent) had shortcomings in all three components of
outcome rating (relevance, efficacy, and efficiency). All downgrades had both shortcomings (with evidence) for some
components and inadequate evidence for other components.




                                                                                                                      87
Appendix E. Analysis of Extent to Which
Gender Is Incorporated in Project Development
Objectives, Components, and Indicators
1.    IEG piloted an addition to the implementation completion report (ICR)
review process in FY16 to include systematic documentation of the presence of
gender dimensions in individual World Bank projects. As part of the pilot, ICR
reviewers examined the following:

        Whether gender is an explicit part of the project development objective
         (PDO) or one of the project components
        Whether the ICR reports sex-disaggregated or female- or male-specific
         indicators.

2.     IEG conducted the pilot to extend the analysis for IEG (2016n). IEG completed
the pilot for 156 projects closed in FY15 with ICR reviews completed by IEG by the
end of FY16.

3.     Along with the results reported in chapter 2, the gender pilot analysis also
noted variation across global practice clusters in the proportion of projects in which
gender appeared to be relevant, and the proportion that incorporated gender into a
PDO or component. As shown in figure E.1, the Human Development cluster had
the highest proportion of projects that integrated gender into a PDO or component
(68 percent), followed by the Sustainable Development cluster with 33 percent and
the Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions cluster with 12 percent. These
differences are statistically significant. Less variation occurred across regions, and
the differences observed are not statistically significant.

Appendix F. Additional Information on the IFC
Portfolio
1.     The regression model for assessing drivers of development outcome and the
predictive model for FY16 factored in project size and other known influencers of
the development outcome, specifically:

            Outcome variable: Development outcome based on a six-point scale (1 =
             highly unsatisfactory; 2 = unsatisfactory; 3 = moderately unsatisfactory; 4 =
             moderately satisfactory; 5 = satisfactory; and 6 = highly satisfactory)
            Project size: Measured by a natural logarithm of net commitment (in millions
             of dollars)
            Real sector projects refer to IFC projects from two industries: (i)
             Infrastructure and Natural Resources and (ii) Manufacturing, Agribusiness
             and Services; Financial and Bank sector projects refer to IFC projects from
             the industry: Financial Institutions Group
            Three internal indicators of IFC work quality (coded as binary variables)

         ◦     Screening, appraisal, and structuring
         ◦     Supervision and administration
         ◦     Role and contribution.

            External risk factors, project level (coded as binary variables)

         ◦     Profit margin for real sector projects
         ◦     Management quality for real sector and bank projects
         ◦     Corporate governance for bank projects.

            External risk factor, country level: Risks captured by changes in the
             Institutional Investor Country Credit Risk ratings (IICCR) between project
             approval year and evaluation year.
            World Bank Group regional fixed effects: Included to control for regional-
             level variations in development outcome not captured by work quality and
             external factors.

Predictive Models for FY16 (IFC Investment Project’s Development Outcomes)
3.     For exploring the directional implication of FY15 and FY16 projects (not
rated), the same set of regressions were run by attaching more weight to the recent
years, FY12–FY15, to the benchmark sample. The regressions of the predictive model
were qualitatively similar to the regression model results for the current year. For
FY15 and FY16 Expanded Project Supervision Report (XPSR) projects not evaluated
(combined), the predicted ratings are lower than the evaluated XPSR sample for real
sector projects, and the predicted ratings are higher for banking sector projects.

Appendix G. Analysis of Factors Affecting
World Bank Group Country Development
Outcome Ratings
1.     IEG analyzed data from its reviews of Country Assistance Strategy
Completion Reports (CASCRs) and completion and learning reviews (CLRs) to
identify factors that might influence World Bank Group country development
outcome ratings. IEG used two approaches:

        Regression analysis to identify associations between country and World
         Bank program characteristics and country development outcome ratings
        Review of thematic objectives articulated in the strategies to determine
         whether the set of objectives differs between countries with higher and lower
         Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), given the relationship
         between country capacity and country development outcomes identified
         through the regression.

Multiple Regression Analysis
2.     IEG conducted a regression analysis to explore factors associated with World
Bank Group country development outcome ratings.1 As a beginning hypothesis, IEG
assumed that four, broad factors influenced country development outcomes: the
level of economic development, government capacity, overall economic
performance, and World Bank Group performance. The regression included country


1The analysis considered past IEG analyses. IEG (2014c) found that the quality of country
assistance strategy (CAS) results frameworks is the most important ratings driver, based on
analysis of 138 CAS Completion Reports (CASCRs) reviewed in FY06–13. IEG (2015o) found
that selectivity is positively correlated with country development outcome ratings.
Selectivity was measured by a dummy variable (1 if the number of objectives or sector
boards is smaller than average) and activity size (total commitments divided by the total
number of lending projects and knowledge products [analytical and advisory activities]).
The previous analysis developed its own ratings for elements of World Bank Group
performance, such as realism, ownership, and the quality of results frameworks, because the
CASCR reviews discuss these topics, but do not provide separate ratings (unlike the country
development outcome, which is based on the ratings of the objectives). This analysis builds
on the previous findings to assess the influence of different factors on country development
outcomes using data from World Development Indicators, the CASCR reviews, and other
internal World Bank sources.

        ANALYSIS OF FACTORS AFFECTING WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME RATINGS
development outcome ratings (based on a six-point scale)2 as the dependent variable
and the following independent variables:

        Level of economic development
            o GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$) as of the end of the CASCR FY
        Government capacity
            o CPIA overall score as of the end of the CASCR FY
        Overall economic performance
            o Average GDP growth rate over the country assistance strategy (CAS)
                review period
        World Bank Group performance
            o Percentage of projects at risk—average over the CASCR period
            o Percentage of projects that exited during the CASCR period with
                project outcome rated moderately satisfactory or above (MS+) by IEG
            o Differences between planned and actual lending amounts (1 =
                increase, 0 = decrease)
            o Lending program size (log of the number of ongoing projects at the
                start of the CASCR period plus newly approved projects)
            o Log of the number of objectives per strategy
            o World Bank expenditures per activity: the total World Bank budget
                and World Bank–executed trust funds for the CASCR period divided
                by the number of World Bank ongoing and exited projects and
                advisory services and analytics activities.

3.     The analysis covered 160 CASCR and CLR reviews during FY07–16. The
regression model explained a little more than 18 percent of the variation in World
Bank Group country development outcome ratings.

4.      The regression analysis found that country development outcomes are
positively correlated with CPIA, average GDP growth rates, and country program
size, and the coefficients are statistically significant at the 5 percent confidence level
(table G.1). Per capita GDP and portfolio quality (projects at risk and projects rated
MS+ by IEG at exit) also affect country development outcomes, but these were
statistically significant at about the 10 percent confidence level. IEG found that
changes to lending amounts, the number of objectives per strategy, and the World
Bank budget do not factor into country development outcomes.


2The country development outcomes ratings scale is as follows: highly satisfactory = 6,
satisfactory = 5, moderately satisfactory = 4, moderately unsatisfactory = 3, unsatisfactory =
2, and highly unsatisfactory = 1.


                                                                                            97

Analysis of Country Objectives
5.      In a CASCR or CLR review, the rating of country development outcome is
based on the collective ratings of achievement of the objectives in the country
program.3 Since FY14, 41 CASCR and CLR reviews are available with objective-level
ratings.

6.    The 41 CASCR and CLR reviews analyzed contained 618 objectives, for an
average of 15.1 objectives per country (table G.2).4 CAS and country partnership


3Country strategies are divided into pillars or focal points, which are broken down into
individual objectives. The World Bank Group and IEG began rating the achievement of CAS
and country partnership framework (CPF) objectives in FY14 and started using these
achievement ratings to determine the overall rating for country development outcome.
Ratings of achievement of CAS and CPF objectives are, therefore, available for 41 CASCR
and CLR reviews completed in FY14–16. Among the 41 reviews, Haiti is counted twice
because the CLR review consisted of separate assessments for the CAS (FY09–12) and the
Interim Strategy Note (CY12–FY14). Of the 20 CASCR reviews completed in the transition
year FY14, eight contained ratings of achievement of objectives. Although the CASCR
reviews for Georgia and Jamaica included some assessment of objectives, the ratings for
individual objectives could not be determined, and therefore IEG excluded those two
CASCR reviews.
4The CASCR and CLR reviews included 625 objectives. For this analysis, IEG dropped two
because they were added ex post at the CASCR or CLR stage (after the country program

framework results frameworks varied in the number of objectives they contained,
from 49 in Morocco to four in Guyana. Some country programs listed several
objectives for each sector or theme, and other country programs consolidated these
into one sectorwide objective.5 The number of objectives per country decreased from
18.9 in FY14 to 13.4 in FY16.6

duplicated under other, similar objectives.
5For example, “improving access to water” and “institutional strengthening of the water

another country program.
6IEG did not assess the statistical significance of differences for the analyses described in
this appendix.
7 Normally this includes information on indicators, baselines, and targets presented in the
results framework, along with information on actual values achieved. Sometimes other
evidence presented in the CASCR or CLR complemented this information. IEG rates
achievement of objectives on a four-point scale: (a) achieved (the objectives are fully met);
(b) mostly achieved (good progress toward meeting the objective); (c) partially achieved
(limited progress); and (d) not achieved (little progress). If the CASCR or CLR presents
insufficient evidence to assess achievement of the objective, then IEG rated the objective as
not verified. For this analysis, objectives rated not verified are included under not achieved.

8.     At the country level, ratings of achievement of objectives vary to some extent
across country types. On average, 54 percent of the objectives were achieved or
mostly achieved in IBRD countries, and a smaller share of 50 percent were achieved
in IDA and blend countries (figure G.2).8

development outcome rating deteriorates (figure G.3), which is expected because the

10.    For the second part of the analysis, IEG categorized objectives into themes
and sectors.10 Some objectives were broad and, consequently, categorized into more
than one theme or sector. Therefore, the total number of ratings of objectives by
theme (641) and by sector (669) is higher than the number of objectives (618). Figure
G.4 shows the share and rating of objectives across themes in four scenarios defined
by CPIA scores and country development outcome ratings. Figure G.5 shows the
ratings of objectives across themes and sectors in detail.

11.     IEG’s review of text related to the 120 objectives rated not achieved suggests
that lack of realism (or too much optimism) and deficiencies in CAS results
frameworks might be reasons why some country program objectives are not achieved.
Thirty-two percent of the objectives rated not achieved cited reasons that might reflect
the World Bank Group country teams’ lack of realism about what the programs could
accomplish during the country strategy period. The reasons included delays in the

9A country development outcome rating of satisfactory corresponds to a country program
in which either the majority of objectives were rated achieved or mostly achieved, or the
majority of objectives were rated achieved or mostly achieved and the program had
exceptional development outcome or impact in one or more areas. A country development
outcome rating of unsatisfactory corresponds to a country program in which either the
majority of objectives were rated not achieved or partially achieved, or the majority of
objectives are rated at least partially achieved, but the program had major shortcomings.
10The World Bank Group changed its themes and sectors in July 2016. IEG used the new
themes and sectors to categorize objectives.

operation supporting the objective or dropping it (21 percent), operations taking longer
than originally anticipated (11 percent), and weaknesses in the implementing agency
(2 percent) (figure G.6). Insufficient evidence was cited as a reason for 23 percent of the
objectives receiving ratings of not achieved (lack of information or weaknesses in the
results framework, such as lack of baselines and targets), which made assessment
difficult. The CASCR and CLR review did not provide the reason for the progress or
lack of progress in 33 percent of the objectives rated not achieved, basing the rating on
the extent of progress made toward the CAS results framework targets.

Appendix I. Regional Results and Performance
Africa Region
Regional Challenges and Evaluation Findings from World Bank Group Operations
in the Region
1.     According to the 2016 Africa Region Update, 2015 economic growth, at 3.4
percent, was at the lowest rate in the Region since 2009, although it was expected to
recover to 4.2 in 2016 (World Bank 2016e). The sharp decline since an average 6.8
percent growth 2003-08 reflects the challenging economic conditions in the Region’s
largest economies and commodity exporters as they face headwinds from lower
commodity prices, tighter financing conditions, and droughts, while economic
growth shows resilience in about a quarter of the countries. Slower growth deepens
the challenge of reducing poverty. The World Bank Group’s strategic framework for
Africa builds on opportunities for growth and poverty reduction to support
structural transformation, economic diversification and inclusion. It seeks to
advance on the Sustainable Development Goals within the new development
finance framework emphasizing human capital, governance, agriculture, resilience,
domestic resource mobilization, affordable and reliable energy, and promoting
private enterprise (World Bank 2016e).

2.     The World Bank’s new lending commitments in the Region for FY16 have
declined from $10.5 billion in FY14 (26 percent of all commitments) and $11.6 billion
in FY15 (27 percent of all commitments) to $9.4 billion, or 20 percent of all World
Bank commitments. The commitment emphasis in FY16 was in Social Protection and
Labor (25 percent), Energy and Extractives (17 percent), and in Health, Nutrition,
and Population and Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience, which respectively
absorbed 10 percent of FY16 commitments. The most significant FY16 shift in
emphasis in U.S. dollar terms is toward Social Protection and Labor—for the four
previous years, commitments under that practice averaged 10 percent against a
current 25 percent (table 8).

3.    The operational performance of the World Bank’s portfolio in the Africa
Region remains below the World Bank average (figure 1). The gap in performance
between the Africa Region and the World Bank average narrowed FY12-14 largely
because of deteriorating performance in other World Bank Regions, and has
remained stable FY13-15. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated
development outcome as moderately satisfactory or better (MS+) for 67 percent of



                                                                                  106
                                                                            APPENDIX I
                                                     REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
the Africa projects (by number of projects) tAhat exited the World Bank portfolio in
FY13–15 compared with the World Bank average of 72 percent. Performance
improvement for the Africa Region between FY10–12 and FY13–15 is statistically
significant. The portfolio performance of projects in the Africa Region from the
Social Protection and Labor Global Practice performed particularly well, as did
projects from other practices such as Health, Nutrition, and Population; Water; and
Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience did well relative to corresponding Bank-wide
averages. Energy and Extractives, Environment and Natural Resources, Governance,
Finance and Markets, and Poverty had lower average ratings, noting that the
number of projects is often small in many cases (table 1).

4.     During FY13-15, the success rate of 191 International Development
Association (IDA) projects in the Africa Region was 69 percent; nine International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) projects had a success rate of 89
percent; and the success rate of 21 blend operations was 48 percent. Performance
was particularly strong in Mauritius (an IBRD country), where all five projects were
rated MS+. As shown in table 5, all projects in the following IDA countries (in which
more than one or two projects were rated) were also rated MS+: Burkina Faso (nine
projects), Côte d’Ivoire (seven projects), Lesotho (four projects), Mozambique (six
projects), Rwanda (five projects), and Togo (three projects).

5.     A review of Implementation Completion Report (ICR) reviews for projects in
the Africa Region portfolio suggests design issues, including complex and
overambitious projects, overestimation of implementation capacity, and optimistic
assessment of government commitment and engagement, are major weaknesses in
quality at entry.

6.     IEG produced 13 project performance assessment reports (PPARs) for the
Africa Region in FY16. Major messages from across the PPARs included, for
example, issues arising from inadequate quality at entry—complex designs,
unrealistic expectations, failure to pay full attention to lessons from previous
operations of the same type, or poorly articulated links with other World Bank
operations. IEG also found that rapid scaling up can pose capacity challenges for
countries and this can hamper planned project outcomes. The PPAR for a
development policy operation (DPO) in Ghana noted that adequate macroeconomic
management is a critical prerequisite for budget support, and that DPOs deployed
in an extremely weak public financial management environment are unlikely to be
successful. Another PPAR (Mozambique) noted that a decision to use country
systems before they are adequately developed could result in mismanagement.
Finally, the PPAR for the Uganda Millennium Science Initiative project noted that it
is possible to establish and implement a world-class science research fund in a low-


                                                                                  107

income country through an integrated approach, but sustainability requires an
appropriate cost-sharing agreement at entry. The project demonstrated a
competitive funding facility that promoted science and technology and was
implemented consistently and with a high degree of transparency. The PPAR noted
that an appropriate cost-sharing agreement is needed at entry to facilitate
sustainability, and that a gender focus is warranted given the low numbers of
domestic scientists.

7.      World Bank support financed a comprehensive effort to improve
transportation services in the Lagos metropolitan area. A key factor in the MS rated
project was support for the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority (then newly
established), which was empowered to plan an integrated transportation system
specifically focusing on implementing and regulating mass transit systems. A
transport fund would be established to eventually cover the costs of infrastructure
maintenance in the metropolitan area. A franchising program for buses was
implemented for specific corridors, and it later attracted commercial funds with no
government subsidy. The PPAR found that relevance of project objectives and
design was substantial, though progress was hindered by the failure to implement a
results framework in the first few years of the project, although the World Bank
performed well during supervision to resolve issues collaboratively. The project
showed that setting up a strong institutional basis for coordinated planning and
regulation is crucial for the success of urban transport projects, and that the
challenges cities face with urban transport and its governance are long lasting and
not quickly fixed. Steady progress with institutional reforms and the establishment
of the transport fund were crucial to this project’s success.

8.     The PPAR for the Mozambique Poverty Reduction Support Credits 3–5
reviewed three single-tranche policy development operations that were part of a
longer program. The program’s objectives were highly relevant to the challenges
facing the country’s economy and were complementary to the concurrent
International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy support. The efficacy of two of the three
objectives (macroeconomic management through institutional reforms and reforms
in governance through supporting decentralization and deconcentration) were rated
modest—the program relied too much on public financial management reforms to
achieve the broader macroeconomic objectives, excluding macroeconomic stability
indicators. The third objective (economic development through improving the
business environment, removing constraints to growth, and promoting agricultural
growth) was rated substantial because it was becoming easier to start a business and
the national infrastructure was improving. These operations and developments in
the country also showed that the political economy context can have critical impacts

on policy reform achievement, and understanding this context can be crucial to
assessing the likelihood that reforms will take place.

9.      The PPAR for the Malawi Financial Management, Transparency, and
Accountability Project found that the effective and accountable use of public
resources and sound economic management are important to improve economic and
social conditions in poor countries. At the time of the intervention, the country was
one of the poorest in the world—75 percent of the population lived on less than
$1.25 per day, and human development indicators were dismal. The project aimed
to improve the accountable use of public resources through investing in financial
management information systems (FMISs), strengthening public financial
management processes and accountability institutions, and developing the civil
service’s capacity. The project achieved considerable progress during its lifetime.
However, the underlying, supporting public finance environment was not
conducive for effectively using the FMIS, which led to disappointing results. FMIS
users often ignored or bypassed processes. As a result, the project outcome was
rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU), with high risks for the sustainability of the
development outcomes actually achieved. The operation became effective just before
elections, and borrower performance initially suffered from lack of commitment. A
major lesson from this operation is that a functioning FMIS is not sufficient to
achieve good public financial management, and changing an FMIS platform carries
substantial risks. Furthermore, recurrent investments are required in both software
and hardware to keep the FMIS fully functional, safe, and updated.

10.    The PPAR for the Zambia Public Sector Management Program Support
Project also notes that although an FMIS was implemented in that country, the
legacy system prevails at the point of service delivery, and large numbers of idle
balances remain outside the treasury’s purview. This raises efficiency concerns and
undermines the system’s functionality as a comprehensive expenditure management
tool.

11.   Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in project implementation in the Africa
Region remains weak, hindered by several institutional challenges, although the
improvement between FY10-12 and FY13-15 is statistically significant. For FY13–15,
IEG rated M&E for projects in the Africa Region as 30 percent substantial compared
with 32 percent for the World Bank as a whole (table 6)—an improvement from 26
percent for the FY12–14 period for Africa. The M&E challenges include project
design complexities; lack of capacity, baseline, and other data; and the low priority
the World Bank and the borrowers gave to M&E.

APPENDIX I
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
12.    The success rate for the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Sub-Saharan
Africa Region, by number of investment projects, was the same as IFC’s overall
averages for 2013–15. IEG validated 46 investment projects in the Region during that
period, of which 25 (54 percent) were rated mostly successful or better compared
with an IFC average of 54 percent. Measured by investment commitments, the
success rate for the Region was 68 percent, which was higher than the IFC average of
64 percent (table 2). The main drivers of success in the projects were conducive
regulatory environment, financially strong project sponsors, and sound project
structuring. Financial sector projects dominated the cohort of projects.

13.    IFC identified several priority challenges for the Region, including addressing
the infrastructure gap. Complex infrastructure projects generally require
management teams that have a relevant record and an appropriate mix of skills and
hands-on knowledge. IEG reviews of IFC investments also show the importance of
IFC ensuring that sponsors have sufficient financial reserves to meet possible initial
performance problems. IFC must be satisfied at appraisal that a borrower has the
requisite technical expertise and practical knowledge to address technical and
performance problems and develop appropriate cost-effective solutions. Without
such technical and financial resources, early underperformance could have serious
implications for a project and its investors.

from the infrastructure gap) is another priority challenge for IFC in the Region. An
IEG PPAR for a grain milling project in Rwanda found that the company’s labor
productivity is among the highest in the Rwandan agroprocessing sector. However,
the company had to develop much of its own infrastructure (roads and electricity,
such as transformers) because of the lack of basic infrastructure services, even in the
special economic zone where the investment was made. This experience illustrates
the general need for investors in the Region to have well-prepared contingency
plans.

15.    IFC expects to rely on Advisory Services projects to address these priority
challenges, along with making investments. Generally, IEG found that requiring a
proper baseline assessment and identifying a control group to demonstrate
productivity outcomes and impacts on beneficiary incomes is an important
requirement of Advisory Services projects addressing productivity issues.

16.   That said, IFC Advisory Projects in the Sub-Saharan Africa Region performed
poorly. IEG validated 38 IFC Advisory Services projects during the review period
and assigned ratings of mostly successful or higher to 18 projects (47 percent), which

is well below the 61 percent overall average performance for IFC Advisory Services
projects (table 3).

17.    In this Region, IEG evaluated and validated 12 Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) investment projects during FY13–15. Seven projects (59
percent) were rated satisfactory or higher, which is slightly higher than the MIGA
average of 50 percent (table 4). To account for MIGA’s entire evaluated portfolio,
this report takes into account projects that received a positive, negative and a No
Opinion Possible (NOP) rating. The success rates for the FY13–15 period were
calculated including projects rated as No Opinion Possible (NOP) in the total
number of projects rated.

Findings from Thematic, Global, and Corporate Evaluations
18.    IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence references relevant Bank Group support in Uganda and
Nigeria (IEG 2016q). The World Bank Group’s comparative advantage in such
circumstances is in supporting countries in tackling long-term development
challenges, including early engagement, sustained presence, and continuous
dialogue. The community-driven development model often provided the World
Bank Group with a useful point of entry in conflict-affected areas, establishing a
presence and contextual learning to support efforts that are more ambitious once
peace is restored. The evaluation finds the World Bank Group generally pursued
two broad objectives related to serious organized violence: addressing the impact of
violent conflict drivers, or mitigating them. Mitigation activities at the local level
(supporting communities and local institutions) were often the starting point and
often based on a community-driven development approach (such as in Northern
Uganda). Such early engagement (through the Northern Uganda Social Action
Fund) was relevant and useful for laying the foundation for post-conflict
engagement.

19.    The evaluation also finds that comprehensive analytical work generally
supported the World Bank Group strategies, most commonly diagnostic studies that
identified the main conflict and violence drivers for ongoing conflicts, or
comprehensive post-conflict needs assessments. However, the World Bank Group
country strategies did not focus on gender-based challenges in a conflict context
(with few exceptions), and that some critical gender-related issues (such as forced
marriages by the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda) were not mentioned in the
strategies throughout the evaluation period. Conversely, the evaluation finds that
the 2007 Public Expenditure Review for Northern Uganda provided a
comprehensive picture of overall public financial flows (both off- and on-budget)


                                                                                   111

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
disbursed to the Northern region and was considered to be a crucial input to
finalizing the Peace, Recovery, and Development Plan (the government’s post-
conflict strategy).

20.     In Nigeria, the evaluation finds that public financial management provided
an entry point for engagement. A general failure to provide adequate governance
was one of the core conflict drivers in the Niger Delta. The 2005 country partnership
strategy (CPS) for Nigeria linked the possibility of direct state-level lending to
demonstrated commitment to the reform through World Bank–led public financial
management diagnostics, and state governments’ commitment to address identified
weaknesses. For the Delta states, the CPS emphasized actions to strengthen the
demand side of governance reforms—supporting public-private dialogue, and
growing coalitions around oil resources management within the framework of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The World Bank’s public expenditure
management and financial accountability reviews, on which the states prepared
reform action plans, created enabling conditions for direct World Bank lending to
the Delta states, though implementation was slow in the last decade because the
state commitment build-up was slower than expected. However, the 2014 CPS
Completion Report acknowledged some progress on state-level public financial
management, especially in public procurement. The evaluation concludes that the
main causes of fragility in Nigeria were at the heart of the country’s developmental
challenges and often beyond the World Bank’s reach. However, the World Bank’s
understanding of discourse on violence in Nigeria has evolved over the years,
reflecting how the World Bank is gradually becoming more comfortable focusing on
the political economy of subnational violence and on developing analytical and
operations instruments to address it. In that regard, community-driven development
was used for information-gathering and contextual learning. As in Uganda,
community-driven development projects allowed the World Bank to maintain a
presence in the conflict regions even when security conditions were highly
unsettled. Stakeholders perceived these projects as serving local communities
instead of governments and ensured relative security for World Bank staff working
on them. However, the projects were not the forum for addressing the insurgencies’
causes and consequences.

21.    IEG’s 2016 learning product Lessons from Land Administration Projects: A
Review of Project Performance Assessments synthesizes cross-cutting findings and
lessons from IEG’s assessments of World Bank–supported projects, including a
project in Ghana, dealing with often complex and politically fraught land
administration issues. IEG compared World Bank Group experience across projects
using different institutional structures to manage two important elements of a land
administration system—registry, which records the rights to land, and the cadaster,

                                                                                APPENDIX I
                                                        REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
which provides information on the location, boundaries, use, and values of land
parcels. The comparison suggests that no single model is best for performing these
functions. The review also emphasizes that making land tenure more secure is a
process, not a single event, and the concept of land tenure and associated rights is
highly context-specific, meaning there are no absolute, generally applicable
standards for defining tenure security (IEG 2016j).

22.     The Ghana project included in the sample on which the report is based, noted
a merger of six land sector agencies that, in practice, continued to work as separate
entities with unconnected accounting procedures. Interventions to enhance tenure
security tended to have better results when sufficiently tailored to match a number
of local conditions, and incrementally strengthening the legal and policy framework
was integral to the process. In this instance, an insufficient appreciation of domestic
political economy factors hindered the Ghana project’s effectiveness. Project
experience shows that social impacts need to be monitored and not assumed, yet
most of the reviewed projects did not explicitly target the poor or vulnerable groups
or reflect social inclusion in their objectives. This also occurred in the Ghana project,
with a net effect of leaving the chiefs’ control over land unchallenged (which, on
balance, might have reduced tenure security for many land users).

23.    Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Development Policy Financing
assesses the application of World Bank Operational Policy (OP 8.60) elements
governing development policy financing related to implementation of the policy’s
environmental and social risk management requirements to identify lessons and
good practices. Examples of environmental risks not identified included an
economic recovery operation in Togo, in which the program document failed to note
any possible negative effects from increased fertilizer and pesticide use. Examples of
unidentified social risks included a Mali poverty reduction support credit series that
did not identify risks from changes in social services delivery, and a Togo DPO that
cited only potential positive aspects for a number of actions, with no reference to
possible social risks (IEG 2015i).

24.     Transformational engagements are a crucial pillar of the World Bank Group’s
current strategy. IEG’s 2016 learning product Supporting Transformational Change for
Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity identified a sample of such engagements from
2000–14 and found that although it may be difficult to identify transformational
engagements ex ante, some salient characteristics can be identified ex post. The
World Bank–IFC Lighting Africa project in Kenya was among the identified
engagements. The project aimed to increase the access of poor households to better,
cleaner, and safer off-grid lighting. This engagement enabled transformation at two
levels: the project transformed the solar lamp market in Kenya by making modern,


                                                                                      113

good quality, affordable lighting products available to the very poor, and it showed
the commercial viability and sustainability of the approach to address the needs of
the population pyramid’s base. The project considered constraints along the entire
supply chain to achieve this transformation (IEG 2016p).

25.      According to the IEG evaluation Financial Inclusion: A Foothold on the Ladder
toward Prosperity, Tanzania is among the least financially inclusive countries in the
Africa Region. The evaluation found that most banks focused on the commercial
sector or, when they catered to retail banking, serving salaried workers. By contrast,
for an IFC microfinance institution (MFI) investee in the country, the cost of resource
mobilization (collecting savings), high operational costs, and low loan officer
productivity posed major challenges. The MFI eventually broke even and recovered
all its losses, though two years later than expected. The MFI now reaches the poor
and microenterprises, even though average loan volumes remain higher than
originally expected. One of the lessons from various IFC investments in greenfield
MFIs in the Region is that they might simply take longer to turn profitable than
originally anticipated, and therefore could need a longer preimplementation phase
(IEG 2015b).

26.     Certain IEG evaluations referenced in the Africa Region Update as part of
Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2015 (IEG 2016n) are again
noteworthy given the particular, ongoing importance of relevant subject matter from
the Africa Region perspective. IEG’s 2015 Evaluation World Bank Group Support to
Electricity Access, FY2000–2014: An Independent Evaluation cited good practice,
national access scale-up experiences worldwide that are relevant for Africa,
including experiences in Africa itself –Kenya and Rwanda –and experiences from
further afield, such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
and Vietnam. With World Bank support, Kenya and Rwanda prepared the first
sectorwide programs in the electricity sector with national electricity access rollout
plans using least-cost combinations of grid and off-grid electrification. After long
periods of stagnation, access levels increased from 6 percent to 15 percent in
Rwanda and from 23 percent to 30 percent in Kenya. Good practice experiences in
off-grid solar home systems (Bangladesh and Mongolia, for example) are especially
relevant for several Sub-Saharan Africa countries in fragile situations, with
dispersed populations, or whose sector conditions are not ready for systematic and
rapid scale-up (IEG).

27.    IEG’s 2015 evaluation World Bank Support to Early Childhood Development: An
Independent Evaluation refers to relevant World Bank support in Mozambique and
Senegal. According to the evaluation, a positive correlation exists between analytical
work on early childhood development (ECD) and subsequent successful World

Bank operations. IEG cites Mozambique where the Minister of Education requested
support for an ECD program within a week after a presentation of dismal child
development indicators from an impact evaluation of an ECD pilot. Furthermore, in
Senegal, three nutrition-related knowledge products and one impact evaluation
were implemented before the World Bank supported five interventions in nutrition.
IEG rated development outcome and borrower performance on each of two
nutrition interventions in Senegal highly satisfactory and satisfactory (IEG 2015s).

28.    Although poverty and economic diversification were central to development
strategies and planning in the resource-rich countries in Africa, such as Zambia and
Nigeria, the results were disappointing. Sustained growth and economic and export
diversification proved elusive, with persistent reliance on the dominant extractive
industry for government revenues and exports. Progress in reducing poverty,
containing income inequality, and creating employment was limited. Zambia was
one of four countries included in an in-depth IEG evaluation of World Bank Group
engagement in resource-rich developing countries (IEG 2015p). The Zambia CPS
focus on macroeconomic and public financial management, investing in
infrastructure, improving the business climate, and encouraging private investment
was generally consistent with the evaluation’s findings on the key drivers of
progress on shared growth and diversification. However, results were limited
because the program implementation was less than effective. IEG rated the Zambia
CPS FY08–12 as MS on both outcome and World Bank performance.

29.    The section on cross-regional findings also presents summary findings from
the learning product, World Bank Group Support for Housing Finance (IEG 2016s).

Evaluation Findings from Country Program Performance in the Africa Region
30.    Analysis for Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2016 shows that
for the 20 countries in the Africa Region for which IEG validated at least two
country strategies during FY07–16, the rating for overall development outcome
improved from MU to moderately satisfactory (MS) in one case, remained at MS for
five countries, remained at MU for eight countries, and declined from MS to MU for
six countries.1

31.    IEG validated five completion and learning reviews (CLRs) for countries in the
Africa Region during FY 16 (Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Lesotho, Mali, and Uganda) and


1The 20 countries included in this analysis are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Ethiopia,
The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger,

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
one country program evaluation (CPE) for Zambia, which is also part of a CPE for
resource-rich developing countries. IEG rated development outcome MS in only one
of the CLRs (Côte d’Ivoire) and rated World Bank performance as good in that
instance. Two countries (Lesotho and Uganda) are rated MU for development
outcome (World Bank performance was rated fair in both instances). For the final two
countries (Botswana and Mali), IEG rated development outcome unsatisfactory and
World Bank performance fair (table 7). Several common themes are apparent across
the five CLRs, although to varying degrees between countries:

         Focus and selectivity in line with country capacities is important. The CLR
          validation for Côte d’Ivoire noted that the World Bank Group’s program
          ambitiously sought to cover almost all elements of the government program.
          In the case of Lesotho, the originally planned program was overambitious
          and complex, with proposed interventions covering a wide range of sectors.
          The Uganda CLR validation stated that the country assistance strategy (CAS)
          program was based on an optimistic reading of the country’s capacity.
         Results frameworks were inadequate or incomplete. The Mali CLR
          validation noted that the results frameworks did not identify the policies
          needed to achieve the CAS objectives. Uganda’s indicators were not always
          chosen appropriately, and Botswana’s results matrix as a whole was
          overloaded, often imprecise, and unduly process oriented.
         Achieving institutional reforms is difficult. This was the main shortcoming
          for the Mali program. The pillar for the Uganda program on strengthening
          governance and institutions was only partly achieved. The envisioned
          outcomes of fiscal consolidation, reduction in wage bill, and strengthening
          public financial management in Lesotho were not achieved.

32.     The Côte d’Ivoire CLR validation noted IFC’s links between investments and
CPS outcomes were sometimes not clear. Thus, for Pillar 2 (improving the
performance of the agricultural sector), IFC provided financing to major cocoa
trading companies, but it was not clearly articulated how this would lead to a
significant increase in rural incomes. In other cases, IFC’s program and its outcomes
were well linked to the country program’s objectives. For example, IFC’s
investments in the power sector (supported by MIGA guarantees) were expected to
contribute to Pillar 4 (renewing infrastructure and basic services) through
investments in generation capacity and natural gas supply development.

33.   The Uganda CLR validation found that the emphasis of IFC’s program was
on focus area 1 (promote shared and sustainable economic growth) and focus area 2
(enhance public infrastructure) and led to advances in the ease of doing business
through support for extending financial institutions’ reach to small and medium

                                                                             REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
enterprises. IFC-supported projects in roads, railways, and hydropower and
financed the Rift Valley Railways to rehabilitate the Kenya-Uganda railway. MIGA’s
program was also oriented toward focus areas 1 and 2 through support for the
energy sector and foreign direct investment in agribusiness and manufacturing.
Furthermore, IEG specifically noted that the IFC and MIGA CAS results framework
should integrate their programs more fully and should select indicators that will
clearly articulate the links between all interventions and progress toward CAS
objectives.

34.     Risk assessment with relevant mitigation measures facilitates program design
and appropriate responses to unanticipated developments. The five CLR reviews
found that the CPSs generally identified the programs’ main risks appropriately, but
the Lesotho CPS did not anticipate political instability. The Mali CPS correctly
identified the risks, but it underestimated the level of political instability—in reality,
the conflict in the northern areas exploded. In these cases, the identified mitigating
measures were not sufficiently robust and implementation was weak. These
examples also emphasize the need for a realistic understanding of political economy
issues.

East Asia and the Pacific
Regional Challenges and Evaluation Findings from World Bank Group Operations
in the Region
1.     According to the 2016 East Asia Pacific Regional Update, the Region’s client
base is exceptionally diverse in income, resources, population size, and fragility.
Extreme poverty has been falling rapidly, from almost 60 percent in 1990 to about 7
percent in 2012, and prosperity was shared, but vulnerabilities persist. The World
Bank’s East Asia and Pacific Regional Update for 2016 notes that growth in China
continued to moderate, but held steady in the rest of developing East Asia and
Pacific (World Bank 2016f). The establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations Economic Community in December 2015 helped bolster trade and the flow
of foreign direct investment. Going forward, the region faces rapid middle class
growth accompanied by intensifying urbanization, an aging population, and
managing the potentially conflicting energy requirements of expanding economies
and the impact of climate change. Against that broad backdrop, the World Bank
Group’s strategy is designed to address inclusion and empowerment, jobs and
private sector–led growth, enhanced governance, infrastructure and urbanization,
and climate change and disaster risk management (World Bank 2016f).

2.     The U.S. dollar amount of the World Bank’s new lending commitments in the
East Asia and Pacific Region trended slightly upward in recent years: $6.2 billion in
FY13, $6.3 billion in FY14, $6.3 billion in FY15, and $7.5 billion in FY16. FY13
commitments in the Region represented 20 percent of all World Bank commitments,
and FY16 commitments represent 16 percent (table 8).

3.     The performance of World Bank operations in the East Asia and Pacific
Region was 73 percent moderately satisfactory or better (MS+) in FY13–15, slightly
above the average performance (72 percent MS+) for the World Bank as a whole
(figure 1).

4.      About 60 percent of the 143 projects rated for East Asia and Pacific in FY13–15
are concentrated in four Global Practices: Education (16), Energy and Extractives
(15), Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience (28), and Transport and Information and
Communication Technologies (20). The Region outperforms the World Bank average
in all four cases based on rated projects and commitments except for performance by
commitment in Energy and Extractives, which dips slightly below the World Bank
average (table 1).




                                                                                   124
                                                                                APPENDIX I
                                                        REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
5.     IEG rated 26 IDA projects and 41 blend projects in the Region between FY13
and FY15, of which 85 percent of IDA projects and 76 percent of blend projects were
rated MS+—better than the performance of the 76 IBRD projects rated during the
same period (68 percent MS+). At the individual country level, performance was
particularly strong in two IDA countries (Cambodia and the Solomon Islands), in
China (IBRD), and in two blend countries (Mongolia and Vietnam). Table 5 shows
that performance was well below the regional and IBRD average in Indonesia (63
percent), and the Philippines (47 percent). During this period only three projects
were rated in Thailand, two of which were rated MS+.

6.     IEG evaluations found that successful projects reflect a strong results
framework defined through a clear, logical sequence between project activities,
output, outcomes, and development objectives, along with a sound reading of the
political economy and the application of relevant learning from past projects.
However, common weaknesses include overambitious objectives relative to project
components or time frame, complex project design involving multiple components
and implementing agencies (lack of strategic selectivity), and overestimating client
buy-in and system capacity.

7.      IEG produced project performance assessment reports (PPARs) for projects in
Indonesia and Vietnam in FY16. Development outcome for the Indonesia Climate
Change Development Policy Loan was rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU). The
PPAR notes that Indonesia is both the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in
the developing world and one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse effects
of climate change and extreme weather events. To support efforts to deal with
climate change, the World Bank joined other development partners in the second
stage of an ongoing, multiyear policy-based loan. The PPAR notes, despite the
relevance of the project’s objectives and its substantially relevant design, its efficacy
with regard to both its low carbon and climate resilience objectives was modest, and
its overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU). An important lesson
identified by the evaluation is that, even where a DPL is unsuccessful with reference
to its own objectives, it may play a positive and strategically important role as part
of longer-term Bank-borrower relationships and this can, in turn, open the way to
effectively addressing an emerging complex development challenge (climate
change).

8.     The PPAR for the Second Higher Education Project in Vietnam rates
development outcome as satisfactory. Project objectives—increase the quality of
teaching to improve the employability of graduates, and increase the quality of
research to improve the relevance of research—were considered particularly
relevant. Design was strong, based on years of detailed technical work and informed


                                                                                      125
APPENDIX I
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
by lessons from an earlier project and stakeholder engagement. The PPAR describes
World Bank supervision as responsive, proactive, efficient, and supportive.

9.     IEG rated 33 percent of East Asia and Pacific Region projects during FY13–15
substantial or better on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (table 6). Weaknesses in
M&E reflect a series of perennial issues, including poor results chains, overreliance
on output indicators and a lack of outcome indicators, using indicators not directly
relevant to project objectives or not directly attributable to project activities, and a
lack of baseline data that precludes measurement of progress (if any).

10.    As noted in IEG’s East Asia and Pacific Regional Update section of Results and
Performance of the World Bank Group 2015: An Independent Evaluation, management in
the East Asia and Pacific Region is acting to address performance challenges,
particularly related to results and M&E (IEG 2016n). Work is ongoing in this regard
after analysis and desk review of 42 projects across the Region’s country
management units (CMUs). The Region, and particularly the Vietnam CMU, are
working with Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) to implement a
results and M&E operational program for operational staff that included three
complementary activities: a results and M&E training workshop, results and M&E
operational clinics, and an M&E framework assessment at the CMU level. The
impact of that training and investment will be seen in future projects. For now, the
Region’s M&E performance is average, although the performance of individual
countries noted in the previous paragraph is relatively impressive.

11.   IEG validated 28 IFC investment projects for FY13–15 and assigned ratings of
mostly successful or higher to 15 projects (54 percent), which was the same as the
IFC average. The Region’s success rate by investment commitment was 63 percent,
dipping slightly below the 64 percent average IFC success rate (table 2).

12.     IFC’s regional strategy emphasizes addressing climate change and sustainable
infrastructure. In this context, a recent PPAR assessed an investment to support the
growth of a medium-size private player in the water and wastewater industry, and
the lesson on environmental and social safeguards from this PPAR is particularly
relevant. It suggests that IFC environmental and social teams should be more
thorough in portfolio supervision visits and should continue to record gaps or
deviations in implementation, which would strengthen IFC’s overall work quality. An
important lesson from an assessment of a highly successful IFC investment in a high-
risk country in the region suggests that partnerships with committed sponsors who
have proven operating records are key, particularly during tough economic cycles.

                                                       REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
13.     IEG validated 27 IFC Advisory Services projects during the review period
and assigned ratings of mostly successful or higher to 17 projects (63 percent), which
is slightly higher than the 61 percent overall average performance for IFC Advisory
Services projects (table 3). A lesson from a recent IEG Evaluative Note (EvNote) for a
Pacific Island Regulatory Simplification and Investment Policy and Promotion
Advisory Services Project suggests that performance reporting systems need to be
simple. Furthermore, reporting systems need to provide useful information to the
client as a basic performance management tool. This could mean sacrificing data
richness and complexity in favor of pragmatism. A lesson from an IEG Evaluative
Note (EvNote) for an Advisory Services project in Vietnam notes that when major
policy changes are required (the tax environment, in this case), IFC should conduct a
thorough scoping exercise to better comprehend the complexity of undertaking the
reforms and set a more realistic time frame and targets. Setting priorities for and
sequencing activities is crucial to ensuring quick wins to create and maintain
momentum while working on longer-term reform initiatives.

14.    IEG evaluated and validated four Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) investment projects in the Region during FY13–15 of which none were rated
satisfactory or higher (table 4). To account for MIGA’s entire evaluated portfolio, this
report takes into account projects that received a positive, negative and a No Opinion
Possible (NOP) rating. The success rates for the FY13-15 period were calculated
including projects rated as No Opinion Possible (NOP) in the total number of
projects rated.

Findings from Thematic, Global, and Corporate Evaluations
15.     IEG’s 2016 evaluation World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence: An Independent Evaluation references relevant support in the
Philippines and Indonesia (IEG 2016q). In the Philippines, the Bangsamoro
Development Agency (BDA) was created as part of an agreement between the
government and the Mindanao Islamic Liberation Front to determine, lead, and
manage relief, rehabilitation, and development programs in the conflict-affected
areas in Mindanao. The World Bank began working with the BDA in 2005 with the
tacit approval of the Philippine government, and this collaboration encouraged
other donors to get involved, helping to cement its capacity and ongoing legitimacy.
With support from the World Bank–administered Mindanao Trust Fund, the BDA
has contributed to economic recovery in conflict-affected areas, benefiting more than
500,000 people in 75 municipalities across Mindanao. As of 2015, more than 300 BDA
staff members operate with a central management office that oversees six regional
offices across Mindanao.

16.     Country programs for Indonesia began paying more attention to the province
of Aceh, although most World Bank Group activities did not officially relate to the
conflict there. However, scaled-up field presence and expertise facilitated the
implementation of key programs (often funded by other donors), which were
essential to sustain the end of the conflict. The World Bank’s program in Aceh
wound down almost as swiftly as it built up. The World Bank Group left Aceh soon
after the tsunami reconstruction was complete and closed its office in 2012 (IEG
2016q).

17.    Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Development Policy Financing
identifies the stand-alone Tonga energy development policy loan as an example of
good practice in addressing several environmental aspects. The main action was to
support development of an energy road map, which consisted of a set of policy
measures and investments intended to address major energy sector weaknesses.
Environmental sustainability was included as a core design principle of the
operation in its support for renewable energy development and energy efficiency.
The project accounted for the possibility that infrastructure development, if not well
designed, could lead to negative environmental effects, and it built several
mitigation measures into the project design. The project screened renewable energy
investments for environmental risks and discarded any options with significant
environmental risks it could not mitigate or avoid. The road map included
requirements for environmental impact assessment and mitigation plans for new
energy investments, and the goal was to make the assessment and mitigation plans
routine requirements for other infrastructure sectors in Tonga. The operation also
included significant public consultation (including on environmental aspects),
linking this to the government’s intention to establish ongoing communication and
consultation with citizens and public stakeholders (IEG 2015i

18.     The Quality of Results Frameworks in Development Policy Operations, a 2015 IEG
learning product, presents the results of a review of the World Bank’s DPF portfolio
based on a sample of operations from across the World Bank Regions, including a
project in Thailand. The review found that the Thailand Public Sector Development
Loan, which focuses on public financial management and service delivery, did not
address public investment management in prior actions, although this was an area
identified in the program document as one of the most challenging reform areas. IEG
also found teams are often better equipped to identify output-oriented results
indicators instead of outcome-oriented indicators because of intrinsic difficulties in
measuring policy and institutional change. Although flexibility is a necessary
component of the programmatic approach, it can sometimes be excessive (as in the
Vietnam Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit), resulting in significant weakening
caused by frequent program adjustments. However, recent changes that shifted the

preparation of investment completion reports for DPOs from six to 12 months after
project closure are a positive step that will enhance the World Bank’s ability to capture
development results in line with stated objectives (IEG 2015l).

19.    Working with a sample of World Bank and IFC projects from across the
regions, IEG’s 2016 learning product World Bank Group Support for Housing Finance
sought to generate knowledge and identify lessons regarding investment,
knowledge, advisory, and other support for housing finance. The review included
an IFC intervention in Vietnam providing a local currency credit line of
approximately $50 million to a commercial bank was based on the use of a long-term
cross-currency swap. When the swap market collapsed in 2008, IFC could not
disburse $20 million. The project evaluation concluded that a long-term cross-
currency swap, which was the fulcrum for IFC’s provision of a long-term local
currency loan, was untenable in Vietnam, which does not have a substantive market
for such swaps, and the financial system essentially operates on a short-term basis.
IEG’s review also underscores the importance of having technical assistance in place
(IEG 2016s).

20.     IEG’s 2016 learning product Lessons from Land Administration Projects: A
Review of Project Performance Assessments synthesizes cross-cutting findings and
lessons from IEG’s assessments of World Bank–supported projects dealing with
often complex and politically fraught land administration issues. The Thailand Land
Titling Program successfully administered a systematic titling program that
contributed to several development outcomes, such as enhancing access to credit.
The Indonesia Land Management and Policy Development Project was part of a
series of land titling projects in the East Asia and Pacific Region modeled on the Thai
program design. Assuming that the Thai model could be successful in other
countries resulted in a design that emphasized land titling and the cadastral survey.
Broader issues regarding the regime of land rights reform were treated as ancillary
and were relegated to a series of policy studies. However, the land rights context in
Indonesia was different from that in Thailand (for example, a more complicated mix
of land tenure traditions and a registration process that itself does not guarantee
ownership). A land titling project in Lao Peoples Democratic Republic exceeded its
titling targets, but the absence of impartial and efficient enforcement of the new land
titles undermined tenure security. The project included components for policy and
regulatory reform, but they were not sufficient, and their implementation was not
well supported. Capacity-building efforts aimed at improving the land
administration institutions’ efficiency and transparency got little traction, and the
project assessment found, among other things, that too many land transactions
continued to be conducted informally to avoid high transaction costs, threatening to
make titles that had been issued obsolete (IEG 2016j).


                                                                                     129
APPENDIX I
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
21.     Furthermore, the review found the overall level of political commitment in
support of a long-term program for land administration was weaker in both Lao
Peoples Democratic Republic and Indonesia than in Thailand. This affected the rate
of progress on institutional reforms and the sustainability of gains from the titling
components. Assessments of those projects found that land titling projects might not
achieve or sustain benefits if the government is not willing to commit to a long-term
program of land administration and allocate the necessary budget. Project
assessments also show, despite the exercise of a systematic process, the poor may
still be neglected due, for example, to the informal practice of making side payments
to officials, resulting in higher costs than legally stipulated, thus reducing the
demand for titles by those of lesser means (IEG 2016j).

Evaluation Findings from Country Program Performance in the Region
22.    Analysis undertaken for Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2016
shows that for the three countries—Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam—in the East
Asia and Pacific Region for which IEG validated two or more country strategies
during FY07–16, the rating for overall development outcome remained moderately
satisfactory (MS).

23.    IEG completed two completion and learning reviews (CLRs) for the East Asia
and Pacific Region in FY16. Implementation of the Country Partnership Strategy for
Indonesia (FY13–15) was rated MS, and World Bank performance was rated good.
The CLR did not provide a rating for Cambodia (FY05–15) because of data
limitations (table 7).

24.     Key lessons from the CLR for Indonesia reference the importance of gauging
the political economy (good technical design alone does not ensure the success of a
project or a program) and developing local capacity to underpin prospects of success
(for example, the ability to effect prompt procurement and the issuance of appropriate
environmental permits). Another important lesson is the need to be more strategically
selective and focused—the three-year program had 15 objectives, eight of which were
considered achieved or partially achieved. The CLR found that the results chain was
robust, but commented on the lack of quality indicators. The indicators sometimes
captured process and activity and, when focused on outcome, tended to refer to the
country level instead of program-derived outcomes. The CLR suggests more time
could have been devoted to the implementation of infrastructure projects, in which
long implementation delays are evident. IFC’s program had substantial relevance,
with emphasis on the focus area Pro-Growth—Promoting Prosperity, and aimed at
addressing issues of connectivity, competitiveness, financial sector, and infrastructure.

25.     The CLR for Cambodia reemphasizes lessons identified in the CLR for
Indonesia, particularly the need to understand the political economy and the extent
of buy-in, and the need to develop and ensure local capacity. In that regard, the CLR
suggests using technical assistance projects to perform advance, comprehensive, and
in-depth assessment of borrower commitment to implement reforms. It also
suggests that making safeguard supervision plans during project preparation and
clarifying respective roles and responsibilities will make safeguard violations less
likely. The CLR draws attention to specific safeguard and fiduciary issues that
affected the World Bank program and resulted in the suspension of new IDA
financing. In that regard, the Inspection Panel found that the Forest Concession
Management and Control Pilot Project in Cambodia failed to comply fully with the
World Bank’s Indigenous Peoples, Natural Habitats, and Environmental Assessment
safeguards. The panel also found that in the Land Management and Administration
Project, the World Bank did not adequately follow up on strengthening public
awareness and community participation and was slow to respond to evictions. An
Integrity Vice Presidency investigation found instances of fraud, collusion, and bid
manipulation. An action plan resulted in remedial measures, including the
establishment of an independent procurement agent. Despite the wide range of
issues encountered during the extended period (FY05–15) and the suspension of
IDA financing after 2011 (after investigation by the Integrity Vice Presidency), the
World Bank remained engaged with the government using nonlending services.
These included analytical and advisory work (health, capacity building on poverty
analysis, technical assistance on social protection, water and sanitation review, and
investment climate analysis), and support through trust-funded activities. IFC
investments helped strengthen institutions and promote financing to rural and
micro businesses, especially in the agricultural sector, and improve infrastructure
and manufacturing sectors. On advisory activities, IFC helped with the adoption of
regulations for establishing a credit bureau and mobile banking.

APPENDIX I
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE

Europe and Central Asia Region
Regional Challenges and Evaluation Findings from World Bank Group Operations
in the Region
1.     According to the 2016 Europe and Central Asia Regional Update, poverty
reduction gains are reversing in many countries in the Region. More than half of the
Region’s countries experienced an increase in poverty between 2005-15, with shared
prosperity stagnating and reversing in several countries. The Region is operating at
60 percent of precrisis growth levels, resulting in high unemployment rates and
particularly high concentrations of female and youth unemployment. Remittances,
an important source of income for many of the poorest, fell substantially with the
decline in host country growth, led by a decline in transfers from the Russian
Federation that is shedding some of its migrant workforce—7 percent of Central
Asia’s working-age population work in Russia (World Bank 2016g). The Region
faces several long-standing and ongoing challenges, such as political uncertainty,
and challenges associated with the refugee crisis and with climate vulnerability
(climate change compounding legacy issues such as inefficient infrastructure, and
unsustainable land and water management). Changes in commodity prices are also
a challenge, one that adversely affects the eastern part of the Region, exerting
pressure on key oil exporters (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia) where
government policy buffers are eroding (World Bank 2016b). The Region also lags on
competitiveness indicators of technological readiness and capacity to innovate.

2.     The World Bank Group believes it can respond to the challenges and to client
demand with tailored approaches that use its comparative advantage—the ability to
take on various partner roles in country, private, and global development, offering
financial, global knowledge, and convening services (World Bank 2016g).

3.    The World Bank’s new lending commitments in the Region trended slightly
upward in recent years: $5.3 billion in FY13, $5.5 billion in FY14, $7.2 billion in FY15,
and $7.3 billion in FY16. FY13 commitments in the Region represented 17 percent of
all World Bank commitments, and FY16 commitments, though a larger amount,
represent 16 percent of total. More than three-quarters of all FY16 commitments to
the Region are concentrated in three Global Practices: Macroeconomics and Fiscal
Management ($2.55 billion, 35 percent); Transport and ICT ($2.07 billion, 28 percent);
and Finance and Markets ($1.03 billion, 14 percent) (table 8).

4.     The overall performance of World Bank operations in Europe and Central
Asia is better than the World Bank performance as a whole: outcome ratings at exit

                                                                                 APPENDIX I
                                                         REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
FY13–15 were 79 percent moderately satisfactory or better (MS+) compared with a
World Bank average of 72 percent (figure 1).

5.     Performance by Global Practice in the Region portfolio is better than the
World Bank average in all cases except Social Protection and Labor, which has a
marginal performance difference, and in Agriculture and Education, in which the
Region performs less well than the World Bank average. Note that Agriculture had
only nine rated projects and Education had seven in Europe and Central Asia during
FY13–15 (table 1).

6.    Average performance across rated projects in IDA and IBRD countries in
FY13–15 (82 and 80 percent MS+, respectively) was stronger than the average of 62
percent MS+ for the smaller number (two) of blend countries in the Europe and
Central Asia Region. Performance in IBRD countries was particularly strong in
many instances—nine countries, hosting a total of 29 projects, registered a 100
percent MS+ rating (table 5). Noting the small number of projects in each instance, a
performance rating of 67 percent MS+ in each of Croatia, Albania, Poland, and Azerbaijan
was well below the IBRD regional average, as was the rating for Turkey (57 percent MS+).

7.     Across the portfolio, common weaknesses in less successful projects include
overambitious objectives relative to project components and time frame, complex
project design involving multiple components and implementing agencies, and
overestimating client buy-in and system capacity. However, a robust results
framework defined through a clear, logical sequence between project activities,
output, outcomes, and development objectives is a common feature among successful
projects. The Results and Performance of the World Bank Group series and other IEG
evaluations have found that successful projects reflect the project team’s willingness
to learn from past projects, and they must always tailor learning to the local context to
add value.

8.      IEG produced two project performance assessment reports (PPARs) in FY16
for projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region. The PPAR for the Private and
Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee in Serbia (approved in 2011 and due to
expire 2017) was rated satisfactory for development outcome. The project sought to
support access to commercial loans on better terms and longer duration; improve
the business environment; support an enhanced, more stable and efficient financial
sector; and support financial discipline, focusing particularly on bankruptcy. The
PPAR found that the World Bank team worked hard to maintain policy dialogue
and to act as facilitator in discussion between government and prospective external
financiers. Objectives closely aligned with country strategy and associated plans to
accelerate progress toward a market-driven economy. The government managed to


                                                                                       139

double maturity and substantially lower the cost of borrowing by using the
guarantee, which also supported financial sector reforms, despite adverse
conditions.

9.      A PPAR in Uzbekistan covered two projects (the Uzbekistan Water Supply,
Sanitation, and Health Project, and the Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply
Project), both of which IEG rated moderately satisfactory (MS). Both projects were
extended—the water, sanitation, and health project operated during 1997–2008, and
the water supply project during 2002–10. The primary focus of the water, sanitation,
and health project was rehabilitating water supplies in three major cities and rural
areas, and the second focus was providing demand-driven rural sanitation and a
program of hygiene education. The relevance of project objectives was high, focused
on service provision and capacity building toward sustainable infrastructure. IEG
rated the project design as substantial, supported by a robust results framework and
a pilot phase. Weaknesses associated with underestimating the community self-help
capacity needed to make the community-driven development approach effective
resulted in dropping the hygiene and rural sanitation components. The water
supply project sought to rehabilitate and improve the efficiency of existing water
supply facilities and infrastructure (which attracted most of the spending) and to
strengthen institutional and financial capacity. IEG assigned positive ratings for both
relevance and project design. However, unrealistic assumptions were made about
the availability of baseline data and stakeholder buy-in. The World Bank’s
performance rating (unsatisfactory) suffered as a result, and high supervisory staff
turnover affected the rating.

10.     IEG rated 38 percent of projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region
during FY13–15 substantial or better on monitoring and evaluation (M&E), which is
above the World Bank average (32 percent) and indicates relative success, though
overall levels of satisfaction with M&E design, implementation, and utilization are
still low (table 6). However, M&E ratings for projects in two IDA countries (the
Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) are promising. As earlier regional updates noted, a
series of perennial issues are evident relating to M&E, including poor results chains,
overreliance on output indicators and a lack of outcome indicators, using indicators
not directly relevant to project objectives or not directly attributable to project
activities, and a lack of baseline data that precludes measurement of progress.

11.    In the case of IFC, IEG assigned ratings of mostly successful or higher to 23
(44 percent) of the 52 IFC investment projects for FY13–15, which is less than the IFC
average (54 percent). The Region’s success rate by investment commitments was 57
percent, which is less than the 64 percent IFC average success rate (table 2).

12.     The regional strategy for Europe and Central Asia notes that countries need
to embrace new opportunities because past growth patterns are no longer possible.
New growth opportunities may come from provision of financial services to
underserved sectors, primarily small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A lesson from
an IEG PPAR that assessed an SME loan to a bank in Turkey is particularly relevant
in that regard. Cost considerations may lead such clients to favor shorter maturity or
foreign currency loans and expose the client (a bank in this case) and its SME
borrowers to greater risk if a devaluation should occur. A similar lesson from an IEG
Evaluative Note on an IFC investment suggests running stress tests at the appraisal
stage to analyze and understand results under pessimistic scenarios, then try to
mitigate risks. Another PPAR emphasizes the importance of sensitivity analysis (a
form of stress test) when working with the nonfinancial sector and recommends
such analyses for all possible scenarios, specifically including scenarios for price
shocks, oversupply, fuel supply price, load factors, and foreign exchange risks.

13.     In the case of IFC Advisory Services projects, IEG assigned ratings of mostly
successful or higher to 18 (72 percent) of the 25 projects validated FY13–15, which is
higher than the 61 percent IFC average (table 3). IFC Advisory Services projects
often engage the public sector (on investment climate reform, for example). An IEG
review of such an initiative in Tajikistan identified the drivers for consideration to
ensure implementation of reforms. These include clearly identifying the entities
responsible for implementation; providing adequate information and training for
officials at the local level; providing the necessary tools and resources to
implementing agencies at the local level; and establishing an incentive structure.

14.     IEG validated 15 MIGA projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region
during FY13–15 and rated eight projects (53 percent) satisfactory or higher, which
was better than the 47 percent average success rate (table 4). To account for MIGA’s
entire evaluated portfolio, this report takes into account projects that received a
positive, negative and a No Opinion Possible (NOP) rating. The success rates for the
FY13-15 period were calculated including projects rated as No Opinion Possible
(NOP) in the total number of projects rated.

Findings from Thematic, Global, and Corporate Evaluations, and Learning Notes
15.    IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence focused on situations of fragility, conflict, and violence, which
are predominantly, though not exclusively, found in middle-income countries. The
evaluation, which references the Kyrgyz Republic, found that when countries
experience situations of fragility, conflict, and violence, the World Bank Group and
the governments may have differing views on how and when to tackle the

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
underlying issues, which makes providing effective support particularly challenging
(IEG 2016q).

16.     In the Kyrgyz Republic, the World Bank co-led (with the Asian Development
Bank and the IMF) a multidonor assessment, The Kyrgyz Republic Joint Economic
Assessment: Reconciliation, Recovery, and Reconstruction, that identified interpersonal
ethnic animosities and national government policies as conflict drivers. The World
Bank adopted a conflict filter as a screening tool to make sure that any World Bank
activity distributed benefits among ethnic and social groups in a way that was seen
to be fair and that would not exacerbate conflict situations. The goal was to provide
information and guidance to improve project design to mitigate the risk of violence,
and strengthen social cohesion. The objectives of the conflict filter were to make task
teams more cognizant of their operating context and help them identify and manage
conflict and fragility risks. The conflict filter sought to identify and then avoid doing
activities (lending and nonlending) in ways that might do harm by stirring up ethnic
animosities. According to the evaluation, the Kyrgyz Republic case shows that the
World Bank can gather information (at a reasonable cost) about the fault lines of
potential conflict and design activities to bridge those fault lines instead of
exacerbating them. This fairly simple and inexpensive tool seems to be most useful
in the aftermath of relatively short and recent conflicts. The country teams found its
application in other contexts to be less useful, such as in Sri Lanka, where the
conflict was much more protracted and stayed unresolved for a long time (ADB,
IMF, and the World Bank 2010).

17.    Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Development Policy Financing
assesses the application of World Bank Operational Policy (OP 8.60) elements
governing development policy financing related to implementation of the policy’s
environmental and social risk management requirements to identify lessons and
good practices (IEG 2015i). Projects in Tajikistan and Georgia were part of the
review sample. The review found that in some instances environmental risks were
included in the provision of support for public-private partnerships (PPPs), but
other operations supporting similar reforms (including a project in Tajikistan)
identified no such risk. The review finds the Georgia Poverty Reduction Support
Operation series does well in dealing with social risk at several levels, especially
regarding the role of the poverty and social impact assessment (PSIA). In this case,
the prior action was the satisfactory implementation of an energy sector medium-
term strategic action plan. The program document succinctly describes the PSIA
conducted before the series of four operations that addressed the distributional
impact of electricity tariff reform. The PSIA determined that the reform would affect
poor people outside of the capital. A mitigation measure was proposed and
implemented to establish a block tariff—a separate lower rate for low levels of

electricity consumption. The section on across-regional findings summarizes the
findings from this evaluation.

18.     IEG’s learning product, World Bank Group Support for Housing Finance, found
that IFC’s €12 million credit line to a commercial bank in Bosnia and Herzegovina
financed more than 1,300 housing loans (€21.3 million). The report also found IFC
staff was also asked to bring expertise to a bank to improve overall mortgage laws
and regulations in the country. IFC’s long-term loan to a bank in Romania enabled
significant growth in the client’s mortgage and home improvement loan portfolio
during 2004–08 and contributed to greater competition that led to increased
mortgage tenor—from 13 years at the end of 2005 to 23 years at the end of 2008—
and a decrease in mortgage rates. Referencing IFC’s provision of a long-term credit
line to a first (greenfield) specialized housing finance company in Romania, the
review also found that pursuing ambitious development objectives through a single
long-term loan can lead to unsatisfactory results. The project’s aim was to develop
and expand the mortgage market and ultimately create a secondary mortgage
market in a country with low mortgage penetration (0.3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2001). The supported entity became the country’s largest specialist
mortgage lender, achieving a market share of 1.7 percent by 2007 with good
portfolio quality; however, its presence in the market was small, and operations
were unprofitable. The company did not securitize its portfolio and did not become
the important secondary market institution envisioned in the project (IEG 2016s).

19.    IEG’s review of housing finance also finds that capital market interventions
require extensive knowledge of relevant country constraints. World Bank upstream
support can be crucial to support the development of the housing finance systems
and capital markets in cases that lack preconditions for success. An example is the
enactment of the new law on residential real estate in Turkey, which included
sections enabling both covered bonds and domestic securitization facilitating
Turkey’s capital markets development. The review also found that extending
foreign exchange loans to unhedged borrowers earning in local currency puts
affordability at risk for vulnerable segments of the population. An IFC-supported
project in Ukraine intended to provide more affordable housing finance through
foreign exchange loans and to stimulate sustainable and healthy market
competition. Providing a loan in U.S. dollars to borrowers earning domestic
currency was highly risky in general, and the low-income group was the least likely
to have protection from a devaluation because they did not have access to foreign
exchange resources. In Russia, dollar loans to borrowers predominately earning in
local currency funded by IFC U.S. dollar loans put borrowers at risk when the local
currency (ruble) devalued in 2008 and 2009 (IEG 2016s).

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
20.    Lessons from Land Administration Projects: A Review of Project Performance
Assessments synthesizes cross-cutting findings and lessons from IEG’s assessments of
World Bank–supported projects dealing with often complex and politically fraught
land administration issues. IEG compared World Bank Group experience across
projects using different institutional structures to manage two important elements of
a land administration system—registry, which records the rights to land, and the
cadaster, which provides information on the location, boundaries, use, and values of
land parcels. The comparison suggests that no single model is best for performing
these functions. Projects in Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Romania, and Tajikistan
used a single-agency model effectively. However, Bulgaria and Slovenia use a
system in which different agencies manage the cadaster and registry, which requires
coordination and data integration. In Bulgaria, a project implementation unit was
established that bridged cadaster and registration services across two separate
agencies and introduced a unified information technology system that allowed rapid
data sharing. In Slovenia, establishment of a project coordinating unit, ongoing
political support through the higher-level Program Council, and the use of digitized
information technology reduced coordination inefficiencies across separate agencies.
Digitized information technology helped ensure seamless coordination between the
registry and cadaster (IEG 2016j).

21.     The review also emphasizes that making land tenure more secure is a process,
not a single event, and the concept of land tenure and associated rights is highly
context-specific, meaning there are no absolute, generally applicable standards for
defining tenure security. Projects in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, the Kyrgyz
Republic, Romania, and Slovenia improved the implementation capacity, legal
framework, and effectiveness of land administration systems, providing a
foundation for better-functioning land markets and other outcomes. In some
instances, deficiencies or inadequate land administration systems affected tenure
security. Responsibilities were fragmented across different agencies, records were
inaccurate, and the boundaries of parcels were unclear. When several of these
projects ended, functioning land institutions were in place with reference to
effectiveness of land administration (for example, less time to register and fewer
steps in the process). Supportive legal frameworks backed the institutional and
technical measures. Strong political commitment facilitated the projects’ progress. In
some countries (Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovenia), the prospect of accession to the
European Union enhanced the political commitment (IEG 2016j).

22.   Most of the projects reviewed did not explicitly target the poor or vulnerable
groups, reflect social inclusion in their objectives, or sufficiently report on social
impacts across projects. Experience shows that social impacts need to be monitored
and not assumed, even when laws and procedures are nominally the same for all

potential beneficiaries. Many of the projects in the Europe and Central Asia Region
did not specifically address the needs of the poor on the basis that land legislation
and procedures have general application regardless of social status and, as such,
relevant projects tended not to monitor social impacts. The project in Bulgaria tried
to address the needs of the vulnerable by providing free legal assistance to registry
and cadaster clients who needed it, but IEG’s assessment found these actions were
limited, and evidence of their social impact was inconclusive. Although project M&E
did not assess social inclusiveness, some of the beneficiary surveys conducted by the
land registry in the Kyrgyz Republic showed that some groups (women among
them) had more difficulty accessing land administration services than others. A
cross-cutting lesson based on experience in the Europe and Central Asia Region
highlights the need for better information to improve knowledge of how land
administration programs affect different groups, and how the welfare of vulnerable
groups might be protected and improved (IEG 2016j).

Evaluation Findings from Country Program Performance in the Region
2.      Analysis undertaken for Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2016
shows that for the 15 countries in the Europe and Central Asia Region for which IEG
validated two country strategies for FY07–16, the rating for overall development
outcome remained MS+ for seven countries. The analysis also shows that the rating
improved from moderately unsatisfactory (MU) to MS+ for five countries, and
declined from MS to MU for three countries. For the five countries for which IEG
rated their country strategies three times during the FY07–16 period, the ratings for
two remained MS. One country’s rating improved from MU to MS and remained so
after the third validation. In two countries, ratings first declined from MS to MU
before regaining an MS rating after the third validation.1

23.    Overall outcomes of World Bank Group country programs in Europe and
Central Asia remain largely positive for FY16. Country outcomes were rated MS or
higher for all seven IEG completion and learning reviews (CLRs) conducted in FY14,
four reviews completed in FY15, and three of four CLR reviews (Uzbekistan, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and Montenegro) completed in FY16 – the fourth CLR review
undertaken in FY16 rated the program for Bulgaria unsatisfactory (table 7).

Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the Russian
Federation, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
24.     A country program evaluation (CPE) of Kazakhstan (FY04-13) conducted as
part of a clustered CPE on resource-rich countries found that impressive economic
growth and rising hydrocarbon prices helped the country make steady progress on
poverty reduction and social development during the review period. However,
some systemic issues still need to be addressed (lack of progress on economic
diversification and anticorruption, the state’s dominant role in the economy, low
skill levels in the labor force, and a legacy of environmental issues). The World Bank
Group performed exceptionally well in its engagement with government, providing
prompt and trusted high-quality technical and policy advice, though this
engagement’s demand-driven nature provides little opportunity for the World Bank
to push the boundaries in defining strategic priorities. Looking forward, the World
Bank Group will need to advance transparency and accountability through
engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, bringing them deeper into the
conversation about ongoing progress. In line with its global development mandate,
and to counteract possible limitations on defining priorities related to the current
emphasis on Reimbursable Advisory Services, the World Bank should consider (re-)
introducing standard, nonreimbursable work on country diagnostics (such as
governance, anticorruption, Public Expenditure Reviews, and poverty assessments).

25.       The four FY16 CLRs’ key lessons highlight the importance of the following:

         Generating buy-in and maintaining ongoing dialogue with government and
          other stakeholders
         The need to improve World Bank–IFC cooperation and coordination
         The value of building flexibility into program design, particularly in middle-
          income countries
         The need to improve the design of results frameworks regarding the quality
          and number of indicators, and the need to enhance M&E.

26.    The CLR for the FY12–15 country partnership strategy (CPS) for Bosnia and
Herzegovina notes that the strategy was based on three focus areas designed to
address some of the country’s main challenges, concentrating on areas of the World
Bank Group’s comparative advantage. The first focus area sought to support
competitiveness and economic growth through tackling key bottlenecks. The second
aimed to promote inclusion through improvements in public services for the
vulnerable and rationalization of social services. The third focus aimed to promote
environmental sustainability through better use of water and forest resources,
climate change adaptation, and sustainable development of municipal water and
sanitation services.

27.    IEG’s review reinforces lessons set out in the CLR itself, including the need
for the following:

      Continue to build flexibility into CPS programming while clear focusing on
       long-term, transformative reform objectives
      Take the care and time needed to build a broad base of support among
       internal and external stakeholders, especially for cross-border projects or
       those involving more than one entity government
      Finalize institutional arrangements for implementation during preparation to
       reduce loss of momentum beyond the largely unavoidable effectiveness
       delays arising from political tensions in state and entity legislatures.

28.    IEG also recommends continuing to build on the strong partnerships
established with a number of EU institutions to both leverage limited World Bank
resources and take advantage of the influence of these institutions on policy
continuity and governance more broadly. The review endorses the practice adopted
in Bosnia and Herzegovina of setting explicit, quantitative goals for IFC investment
activity as part of a clear and transparent effort to achieve the CPS objectives and the
World Bank Group corporate goals. Furthermore, the review also endorses the
country team practice of preparing joint business plans that specify the areas, forms
of engagement, and milestones for joint World Bank Group cooperation.

29.     IEG’s CLR review for the Montenegro CPS for FY11–15 notes the close
alignment of the country strategy’s two focus areas (support for EU accession, and
environmental management) with the government program’s core priorities. The
review finds that the CPS was not a joint World Bank–IFC document and that
potential synergies between IBRD and IFC were underused as a result. The review
finds that two main IFC investments during the CPS period were unrelated to the
CPS objectives. It also finds that the original CPS results framework showed
significant weaknesses affecting program implementation, and that the World
Bank’s flexibility in program implementation perhaps weakened the relevance of the
program—for example, dropping a public expenditure management objective at the
time of the CPS progress report. The review notes that the approval of a policy-
based guarantee without ensuring an adequate fiscal policy framework may have
increased the World Bank portfolio’s exposure risk. During program
implementation, however, the World Bank managed to improve its portfolio quality
while making significant adjustments to the original program to reflect changes in
the government’s priorities, ensuring the quality of the current portfolio remains
broadly satisfactory. The CPS progress report significantly modified the results
framework, which generally increased the evaluability of the program, although
some original weaknesses remained unaddressed. The review finds the program


                                                                                       147

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
helped to strengthen certain institutions, but the most significant progress against
the CPS objectives was in sustainable land management, reforming the government
system to deliver assistance to farmers, strengthening local research capacity,
improving the reliability of the power supply, and strengthening solid waste
management. IEG largely agrees with the CLR’s lessons, particularly regarding the
importance of selectivity for a small portfolio, the World Bank’s complementary role
in supporting the EU accession process, and the detrimental effects of shortcomings
in the results framework. Furthermore, IEG notes that the World Bank Group
effectively used regional projects to generate both economies of scale and additional
policy insights, and that there is room for increasing IBRD and IFC integration in the
forthcoming Community Support Framework. IEG states that a clear justification is
needed when dropping a crucial policy objective from the program (referring to the
dropped public expenditure management objective) and emphasizes the importance
of calibrating program design to factor in government ownership to achieve a robust
program that is less vulnerable to sudden changes in government sentiment.

30.     The CLR for Bulgaria (rated unsatisfactory) assesses the World Bank Group’s
innovative approach to support Bulgaria in its efforts to further integrate into the
EU, to which it accessed in 2007. Given the significant funding available to Bulgaria
through EU funds, the CPS pioneered a new model of knowledge-based country
engagement building on the Reimbursable Advisory Services program. The idea
was to engage in selective, fee-based policy support enable the government to
leverage the World Bank’s knowledge and experience better to accelerate
investment projects and more effectively absorb available EU funding. The program
was organized into three focus areas: knowledge and advisory services for policy
and program development in innovation, education, public finance, competitiveness
(business regulatory environment), green growth, and social inclusion; advisory
services and ongoing operations to support the preparation of large projects to
secure EU support; and financing for priority, results-based projects ineligible for
EU funding. The CLR finds the strategy to be relevant, innovative, and selective in
its approach, but overoptimistic in its assessment of the durability of key conditions
(including political continuity and stability and country ownership) that would be
required to support the efficacy of the main instrument (the Reimbursable Advisory
Services program). In that regard, a smaller, less ambitious program might have
fared better. Generally, IFC was expected to focus on business regulation advisory
services, agribusiness (including land consolidation), energy, transport, and
banking. However, these activities appeared to be add-ons to the World Bank
program, and the results framework did not reflect the expected outcomes of IFC
activities. IEG generally concurred with the lessons in the CLR. However, IEG
added that greater attention to the potential role of closer cooperation between the

World Bank and IFC should be pre-planned—especially in areas of mutual expertise
and experience, such as energy, banking, and business climate—to both improve the
quality of World Bank Group assistance and to have greater impact in the field.

31.     The FY16 CLR reviews highlight lessons regarding the substantial overall
program of analytic and advisory activities in Europe and Central Asia. For
example, the CLR for Bulgaria endorses using analytic and advisory activities to
keep current with developments in strategic sectors in which the World Bank is not
lending. The CPS for Uzbekistan planned significant analytic and advisory support
for the competitiveness and diversification thematic areas, and the program
followed up in implementation (60 percent of all analytic and advisory activities in
Uzbekistan). Therefore, support to develop the Uzbekistan Vision 2030 program
(business climate reforms and improvement in the financial infrastructure) was a
major activity. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a series of core diagnostic reports
supported the CPS, and further work during the CPS period was undertaken to
prepare for the next stage of strategic planning. Furthermore, when a development
policy loan series was dropped, the World Bank maintained open dialogue with the
client through its analytic and advisory activities program (including support for
debt management, and analytical work on social spending and smart safety nets).

32.    The CLRs report on a range of IFC Advisory Services support, including
work that is regional in scope. Advisory support focused on business climate and
the energy sector in Montenegro. IFC faced challenges in the provision of advisory
support for PPPs in Bulgaria (water sector) and Uzbekistan (health sector). In Bosnia
and Herzegovina, IFC participation in the CPS process and World Bank-IFC
cooperation were particularly strong, and the CLR review noted important lessons
from this experience. Setting explicit, quantitative goals for IFC investment activity
should be part of a transparent effort to achieve the CPS objectives and the World
Bank Group corporate goals. Furthermore, preparing joint business plans specifying
the areas, forms of engagement, and milestones for cooperation between the World
Bank Group organizations was a useful tool for joint CPS implementation.

33.    The Montenegro CLR noted that IFC program relevance to the CPS objectives
was low. IFC advisory services in the investment climate and energy sector and a
relatively small credit line in the financial sector contributed to attaining the CPS
objectives. However, IFC made major investments during the review period in road
infrastructure, which were not included in the CPS objectives. IFC’s other
achievements as presented in the CLR are mostly unrelated to specific CPS
objectives. Potential synergies between IBRD and IFC remained underused in the
original program design and its subsequent modification. The CLR review for
Uzbekistan noted that IFC interventions were designed to complement World Bank

                                                      REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE

Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Challenges and Evaluation Findings from World Bank Group Operations
in the Region
1.     According to the 2016 Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Update, the
slowing pace of global activity and commodity prices that remain weak—with
prospects that they will remain lower for longer—provide the backdrop for the
Region in 2016. Economic activity in the region was hard hit and is likely to contract
for the second consecutive year (IMF 2016). However, differences in individual
country growth outcomes resulted from external and domestic factors that have
affected countries differently. The ongoing U.S. recovery continues to support
activity in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, but China’s manufacturing-
based slowdown reduced the demand for exports from South America, and further
declines in commodity prices added to the accumulated terms-of-trade shock for
commodity exporters. Adjustment to the more fragile external conditions was
smooth in countries where macro policy frameworks had improved during the past
two decades, but policy missteps, domestic imbalances, and rigidities led to sharp
declines in private demand in a few countries. Lending broadly reflects the World
Bank Group’s strategic framework for the region, which sets the stage for economic
recovery, strengthening infrastructure services, investing in human capital, and
protecting the poor (World Bank 2016g).

2.     The World Bank’s new lending commitments in the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region trended upward in recent years: $5.2 billion in FY13, $5.1 billion
in FY14, $6.0 billion in FY15, and $8.2 billion in FY16. Commitments in FY16
represented 18 percent of all World Bank commitments, almost reaching the same
proportionate share as FY12 ($6.6 billion, 19 percent). The Region’s share of overall
commitments had diminished in the intervening years (table 8). By World Bank
Global Practice, FY16 commitments are concentrated in Macroeconomic and Fiscal
Management (25 percent), Governance (18 percent), Environment and Natural
Resources (11 percent), and 10 percent in Transport and Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT). Commitments under Macroeconomic and
Fiscal Management, and Transport and ICT are part of a pattern of significant
support for projects under those practices during FY12–16 (table 8).

3.      IEG rated 152 projects in the Region, of which 73 percent were rated MS+—
just above the World Bank average of 72 percent MS+ for FY13–15 by number of
projects (figure 1). By commitments, IEG rated 89 percent of projects as MS+, which
is slightly better than the 86 percent MS+ World Bank average by commitments
(figure 1).


                                                                                    157
APPENDIX I
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
4.     Allowing for small numbers of projects in most instances, projects under the
Education, Environment and Natural Resources, Governance, Poverty, Trade and
Competitiveness, and Transport and ICT Global Practices performed better than the
relevant Global Practice average across the World Bank. Projects in the Water sector
(54 percent MS+, 13 projects rated) and the Energy and Extractives sector (43 percent
MS+, 7 projects rated) performed below average for FY13–15 (table 1).

5.     IEG rated 111 projects across 15 IBRD countries, of which 75 percent were
rated MS+ for FY13–15—better than the performance of the 13 projects rated across
four blend countries (62 percent MS+) and the 23 projects rated across four IDA
countries (65 percent MS+). In six IBRD countries, two blend countries, and one IDA
country, IEG rated all 22 projects as MS+. Relatively poor performance for the 27
projects rated in Brazil (IBRD) during FY13–15 affected the Region’s overall
performance because only 56 percent of those projects were rated MS+, and 2 (29
percent) of the seven projects rated in Honduras (IDA) during the period were rated
MS+ (table 5).

6.     Taking a closer look at the poor performance of projects rated for the Water
practice FY13-15 (table 1), Implementation and Completion Report (ICR) reviews
suggest Water projects are generally challenging during implementation because
they may involve engagement with different levels of government, significant
infrastructure development that is technically difficult, and institutional change at
both the national and subnational levels. The projects evaluated during FY13–15
included several at the subnational level (e.g., Brazil), or projects in which
subnational levels of government had significant responsibility. Some of the projects
rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU) for outcome (for example, the Rio Grande Do
Norte Integrated Water Resources Management Resources had an implementing
agency that showed limited capacity in leading and coordinating the project’s
participating actors. The project management units also had limited capacity for
managing and overseeing contractors, which in many cases produced poor-quality
outputs (activities were unfinished or reduced in scope). A lesson from the region’s
water sector is that streamlined projects with focused activities might be easier for
low- capacity borrowers to implement because many diverse activities at different
government levels can create an implementation burden that is too heavy for the
borrower. Another lesson is that adopting a subnational lending strategy requires
balancing both significant benefits and drawbacks. Lending directly to subnational
governments can contribute to greater project intervention relevance, narrower
project scope that helps in measuring the project’s impact, and strengthened
institutional capacity. However, the subnational borrower might be unaware of its
implementation weaknesses and therefore have limited capacity to procure the right
technical assistance to address weaknesses or to absorb it once procured.

                                                       REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
Furthermore, the need to clarify loan guarantee terms between the province and the
national government might cause delays.

7.      Projects in the Energy and Extractives practice also performed well below the
average for the Region, noting only seven such projects were validated FY13-15
(table 1). ICR reviews suggest implementation delays were common across projects
rated moderately unsatisfactory and below. In the case of the Renewable Energy
Resource Markets project in Argentina (rated moderately unsatisfactory), three of
the four objectives were not achieved. This was largely associated with the
underestimation, at entry, of risks that ultimately materialized in the form of the
economic crisis of 2001. This resulted in insufficient budget allocations to the project
at the federal level, and reduced budget allocations for rural electricity subsidies at
the provincial level leading to major delays in project execution and in the
realization of anticipated economic benefits. Haiti’s Electricity Project was rated
unsatisfactory (U). IEG’s review found administrative inefficiencies led to cost
overruns and implementation delays (even prior to the earthquake). Furthermore,
modest design meant that the outcome for the first objective—achieving sustainable
improvement in the quality of electrical services to customers—could not be
attributed to the project. There was a negative outcome for the second objective—
strengthening the financial and operational performance of the power utility
company. The Power Sector Efficiency Project in Honduras was rated unsatisfactory.
In this case, considerable operational inefficiencies resulted in delays and the need
for major reallocation of IDA resources. Finally, the Bolivia Decentralized Electricity
for Universal Access project is rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU) based on
modest efficiency and modest design relevance.

8.     Lessons from ICR reviews suggest that projects rated satisfactory for
development outcomes highlight some well-known ingredients for success:
government commitment, dialogue and consensus building among beneficiaries,
and focused interventions that work in partnership with existing institutions in the
private and public sectors. The Environmental Services Project in Mexico enhanced
the provision of nationally and globally significant environmental services, and
secured the long-term sustainability of environmental services by supporting
projects that were part of the government’s larger Pro-Árbol Program, and thus
received substantial commitment as shown in the level and consistency of
government funding allocations. In Nicaragua, the Land Administration Project
helped develop a legal, institutional, and participatory framework for property
rights administration, and showed the feasibility of a systematic land rights
regularization program. Building broad social and political commitment with a
strong focus on local government investment in cadaster and registry modernization
successfully addressed these problematic social issues. The project is an example of


                                                                                     159

alternative conflict resolution mechanisms facilitating cadastral and regularization
processes. The Peru Rural Electrification Project showed that seeking to engage
actively with distribution companies from the early stages of program design is
essential for gaining ownership, adequate financing, and overall effective design.
The productive use of electricity—especially in middle-income countries with a
critical mass of entrepreneurs—can be key to achieving long-term development
impacts from rural electrification programs.

9.      The six project performance assessment reports (PPARs) disclosed in FY16
provide additional insights on project performance drivers. For example, productive
partnership projects need to pay attention to both farmers and buyers. The PPAR for
Colombia’s Productive Partnership Project notes that the project paid more attention
to the productive capacity of smallholders than of commercial entities. This
adversely affected commercial entities’ engagement in project opportunities because
they lacked awareness. Generally, such projects are more likely to succeed when
they are part of an integrated rural development approach. Farmer alliances in
Colombia suffered the consequences of poor rural infrastructure (storage, roads, and
power) and weak extension services. The lack of cold storage facilities and the high
cost of transport significantly constrained perishable goods producers’ earning
opportunities. The PPAR for Nicaragua’s Education Project (FY05) suggests that
World Bank Group support needs to go beyond technical aspects. In developing the
education project, the World Bank provided strong technical support in designing
the school autonomy model. However, it appears that the World Bank did not
provide sufficient support to the reform’s logistics elements, such as piloting an
information system or building local capacity. Similarly, the government and the
World Bank did not consider the political economy behind the reform.

10.     IEG rated the Latin America and the Caribbean Region’s performance for
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as substantial or better for 27 percent of projects,
which is below an already low World Bank average (32 percent), indicating
particularly low overall satisfaction with M&E design, implementation, and
utilization during FY13–15. Common gaps in M&E include poor results chains,
overreliance on output indicators, a lack of outcome indicators, using indicators not
directly relevant to project objectives or not directly attributable to project activities,
and a lack of baseline data that precludes measuring progress (table 6).

11.   IEG validated 53 IFC investment projects for FY13–15 and assigned ratings of
mostly successful or higher to 33 projects (62 percent), which was better than the IFC
average (54 percent). The Region’s success rate by investment commitments was 70
percent, also better than the 64 percent IFC average success rate (table 2).

countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region, shows the importance of
IFC advisory interventions in establishing a strong enabling environment. Relevant
projects, often executed in collaboration across the World Bank Group, frequently
benefited from high-quality analytical work and stakeholder assessments.

14.      A lesson from an IEG PPAR that assessed an IFC housing finance technical
assistance project (IFC Advisory Services) in Mexico is that including mid-term
corrections in projects targeting untested financial markets can help enable the
creation of a mortgage loan product that reaches the poor. Market-making projects
carry unknowns that this project identified and embedded as part of the
implementation process. IFC support training provision, the creation of mortgage
units, and the launch of a mortgage loan product. Afterward, a series of visits to the
financial institutions to test procedures, methodology application, and the product
itself led to significant project corrections. One of the main findings was that the
number of potential clients for the product and service innovations that IFC’s client
could identify was constrained significantly by the proof of formal income
requirements. The project team suggested a socioeconomic study to explore the
situation. Furthermore, the project team helped the institution define a solution that
engaged potential clients in a six-month savings program that helped build trust,
which allowed clients to access housing loans. This product increases the potential
for low-income clients with no formal proof of income to access housing. Such
clients typically have difficulty demonstrating their willingness and ability to pay.

15.    IEG evaluated and validated one Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) investment project in the Region during FY13–15, and it was not rated
satisfactory or higher (table 4). To account for MIGA’s entire evaluated portfolio, this
report takes into account projects that received a positive, negative and a No Opinion
Possible (NOP) rating. The success rates for the FY13-15 period were calculated
including projects rated as No Opinion Possible (NOP) in the total number of
projects rated.

Findings from Thematic, Global, and Corporate Evaluations
16.     A lesson from IEG’s 2016 learning product World Bank Group Support for
Housing Finance is that when expanding affordable housing is an intervention’s key
objective, the intervention needs to be targeted and the results measured adequately
(IEG 2016s). In Honduras, an IFC joint advisory and investment project supported a
commercial bank with the objective of moving down-market by increasing housing
segments as part of the client bank’s growth strategy. The housing finance
expansion outperformed its targets, for example, for value and numbers of
outstanding loans in its portfolio and its targeted average loan, which likely
enhanced access to finance for first-time housing finance borrowers from the
middle- and upper-income segments. However, IEG found little evidence that the
project fully supported its objective to serve low- and medium-income households.
Because of the high average loan size and minimum and maximum income
requirements ($500–$1,500 per month), the bulk of expanded mortgages likely went
to borrowers in the upper-middle and above income categories instead.
Furthermore, if there is no significant mortgage financing in the target country, the
low-income segment should not be prioritized, but should be introduced gradually
as the mortgage financing market develops. In Mexico, the World Bank supported
the Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF) to stabilize and develop the mortgage
market with two minor components to expand access to low-income housing.
Although the project allowed SHF to inject liquidity into the sector and prevented
the slowdown of the housing market in the aftermath of the crisis, expansion of
products toward lower-income segments was modest because the goal of market
stabilization and strengthening SHF’s financial position was the priority.

17.    IEG’s Lessons from Land Administration Projects: A Review of Project Performance
Assessments suggests that technical integration and interagency coordination and
collaboration need to be part of a project when different agencies manage the
cadaster and registry functions (IEG 2016j). The report notes that an insufficient
understanding of tenure insecurity in the region hindered the Guatemala Land
Administration project. The project assessment found that the project pilot was in a
region where lawlessness was so pervasive that even regularizing the peasant
farmers’ tenure status would not protect them from subsequent acts of coercion
intended to make them give up their land. To enhance tenure security, it would have
been important for this type of project in that particular region to embed the
regularization process into a wider program to strengthen law and order and reduce
the scope of physical coercion of property owners. This wider commitment was
missing when the project was prepared.

18.     IEG’s 2016 learning product Supporting Transformational Change for Poverty
Reduction and Shared Prosperity identified a sample of such engagements from 2000–
14 and found that although it may be difficult to identify transformational
engagements ex ante, some salient characteristics can be identified ex post (IEG
2016p). The report references a project in Peru that sought to provide a rural roads
system to help alleviate rural poverty through increasing access to markets, income-
generating opportunities, and basic social services. The program supported systemic
change by developing the institutional capacity for rural road decentralization at
several levels. It also included specific pro-poor components, such as a mechanism
to provide funds for local development that helped small associations of rural
producers to develop business plans, obtain funding, and capitalize on
opportunities the new infrastructure provided. The program’s maintenance
activities create job opportunities for poor, rural men and women who live
alongside the rehabilitated roads—a concept replicated in Bolivia, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras. The program in Peru was eventually scaled up to
cover the entire country, and an impact evaluation for Peru shows the rural roads
interventions had a large impact on reducing extreme poverty (Macroconsult-
Cuanto 2014).

19.    IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence (IEG 2016q) notes that the World Bank experience during the
past 20 years in Colombia shows that interventions generally aimed to mitigate the
impact of conflict and violence on households, farmers, and communities, and to
address some conflict drivers. These two goals were interlinked, and one or other
was prioritized, subject to circumstance and need over time. The World Bank started
with mitigation activities at the local level by supporting communities under
extreme duress, and as security gradually improved, it began working with local
institutions, emphasizing education sector support. Eventually the World Bank
turned its focus to facilitating broader regional or national-level policies focused on
land titling and restitution. A

20.    Analysis undertaken for Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2016

strategies during FY07-16—including three OECS countries rated together—overall

improved from MU to MS for Colombia, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Jamaica, the
OECS countries, and remained MU for Bolivia, Honduras, and Paraguay.1

21.     IEG completed six completion and learning reviews (CLRs) for the Latin
America and the Caribbean Region in FY16. Overall development outcome at the
country level is rated satisfactory for Uruguay, MS for Colombia and Guyana, MU
for Bolivia and Honduras, and unsatisfactory for Haiti noting the implementation of
the CAS FY09-12 was interrupted by the catastrophic earthquake of January 2010. It
is also notable that two post-earthquake interim strategy notes (ISNs) for Haiti, CY12
and FY12-FY13, were rated moderately satisfactory (MS) World Bank performance is
rated good or fair in all six cases (table 7).

22.     The main lessons in the six FY16 CLR reviews highlight that responding to
country priorities and being flexible, open, and selective will likely lead to a
substantive strategy. Furthermore, project preparation that fails to assess
institutional capacity and identify potential gaps and related mitigating measures
will likely to lead to subpar project implementation that can affect country-level
outcomes. The need to pay more attention to what happens after project closing is a
lesson on intervention sustainability—when preparing and appraising a project, the
World Bank should incorporate prospects and plans for sustainability on project
completion. In some operations (Colombia), the World Bank did not conduct the
extensive due diligence required or maintain the fluid dialogue needed with the
government to anticipate adverse outcomes and facilitate decision making by both
the World Bank and the authorities.

23.     Many of the countries in the Region for which a CLR review was conducted
in FY16 moved up the income ladder over the course of their country strategies,
strengthened their policy frameworks, and became more mature and demanding in
their relations with the World Bank Group. Clients have a clear idea of what they
need from the World Bank Group and how the World Bank Group can contribute to
their country development goals. The positive effect of this new reality is more
government ownership of country programs, better results in areas of World Bank
involvement, and a new relationship in which country officials and private and
public institutions are more closely involved in the design of World Bank
interventions and more committed to the follow-through with policy and project
commitments. An example is Uruguay, which led program preparation and
implementation, underscoring its ownership of the program. However, this

approach can potentially leave the World Bank Group out of areas in which it has
significant comparative advantage, experience, and much to contribute—for
example, secondary and tertiary education in Uruguay.2

24.     The discrepancy between the development outcome ratings and World Bank
performance ratings in country programs relate to a number of factors of World
Bank Group program design and supervision, and response to exogenous changes.
Although development outcomes generally improved, the design of results
frameworks had weaknesses. In several instances country program results
frameworks did not incorporate IFC and MIGA activities. In others, they relied on
outcome indicators that poorly reflected the targeted outcomes, were based mostly
on outputs instead of outcomes, or did not quantify baselines and target values for
indicators, which made program assessment difficult. These shortcomings also had
adverse effects on supervision because teams could not use the results framework to
closely monitor program performance or restructure interventions when needed. In
some cases, when indicators were redefined at the progress report stage, the level of
aspiration, or reach, was lowered while World Bank financing was increased,
particularly through DPLs to support the budget. For example, the Honduras
country level results framework was poorly designed, and it failed to incorporate
IFC and MIGA activities even at the progress report stage when such activities were
more certain. In other cases, such as Colombia, the original program design was
unrealistic because of unanticipated or unaddressed implementation constraints and
other implementation issues (including fiduciary) many of which were associated
with predictable inadequacies in institutional capacity. IEG’s review found that
revisions at progress report stage curtailed the overall ambition of the strategy, and
made the results framework more precise in light of scaled down Bank
interventions. Outcomes were cut from nine to eight, and certain outcomes were
revised to better reflect Bank interventions. Of the original 26 indicators, 15 were
revised, seven dropped for improved measurement, and five were added to account
better for results, although, in some instances, the redefinition of outcomes led to a
significant lowering of the bar with indicators set as outputs rather than outcomes,
despite a significant increase in Bank financing. Generally, the new reality of
enhanced country program ownership by the authorities and private and public
institutions and their greater involvement in implementation outweighed some


2Although other development partners (Inter-American Development Bank) were involved
in these areas, the completion and learning review recognized that a more comprehensive
education strategy would probably have been more effective to improve education results in
Uruguay, which significantly lags peers of similar per capita income in education
achievement.

shortcomings of World Bank Group performance to produce better development
outcomes and help countries achieve their development goals.

25.     IEG conducted its country program evaluation (CPE) for Bolivia (FY05–13) as
part of the clustered CPE for resource-rich developing countries. The Bolivia CPE
found that the government must focus on improving agricultural productivity and
living standards in rural areas to achieve the goal of substantially reducing extreme
poverty. It also recommends that the World Bank Group collaborate with the
government to examine the interventions it supported, evaluate their impact on
poverty, and distinguish between their social assistance and productivity-enhancing
aspects. This would enable the World Bank Group and the government to identify
the main problems, diagnose their causes, and set priorities for a development
strategy. The CPE also found that assistance provided in urban development is
likely to be more effective and its scope more easily expanded if the assistance is
embedded in a government program. To ensure smooth project execution, the
World Bank must devote resources to help its Bolivian counterparts learn about and
comply with World Bank procedures, especially the procurement and contracting
aspects. Regarding governance, the World Bank emphasized staying engaged and
now maintains connections in public financial management, decentralization, and
transparency and institutional strengthening. The evaluation finds that although the
approach could have been appropriate for a transitional period, it may no longer be
appropriate because the World Bank could incur reputational risk from supporting
politicized projects. The evaluation recommends that the World Bank use analytic
work to stay current on development in relevant areas and respond to the
government’s requests for assistance on specific topics.

Middle East and North Africa
Regional Challenges and Evaluation Findings from World Bank Group Operations
in the Region
1.     According to the 2016 Middle East and North Africa Regional Update, a
combination of factors threatens the strong achievements in reducing extreme
poverty and boosting shared prosperity, including refugees and displacement,
violence and conflict, low commodity prices, and climate vulnerability. These factors
increase the region’s fragility as a whole and the need for strategic World Bank
Group support while making the operational environment riskier. Along with these
pronounced factors, countries in the Middle East and North Africa Region still face
many long-standing development challenges and structural issues. Voice and
accountability remain low across the region, and labor force participation rates for

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
women are the lowest in the world (in 17 of 19 countries, women’s participation is
below the world average of 50 percent in 2016). The region’s level of financial
inclusion is among the lowest in the world, particularly for women (in 2014, 19
percent of men and 9 percent of women had a Bank account compared to the next
highest Region, Africa, where, respectively, 34 and 30 percent had bank accounts),
and youth unemployment, particularly among educated youth is the world’s
highest (39.5 percent of those educated to tertiary level were unemployed in 2015).
The region is the world’s most water-scarce area, its droughts driving fragility and
displacement. Middle East and North Africa is more generally vulnerable to climate
change impacts, especially regarding water scarcity and food security. To address
these challenges, the Middle East and North Africa Regional Update 2016 proposed
a new strategy, Economic and Social Inclusion for Peace and Stability: A New Strategy for
the World Bank Group. The strategy builds on four mutually reinforcing pillars:
renewing the social contract, regional cooperation, resilience to shocks associated
with internally displaced persons and refugees, and recovery and reconstruction
(World Bank 2016i).

2.       The World Bank’s new lending commitments in the Region trended upward
in recent years: $2.1 billion in FY13, $2.8 billion in FY14, $3.5 billion in FY15, and $5.2
billion in FY16. Commitments in FY16 represented 11 percent of all World Bank
commitments compared with 4 percent in FY12 and 7 percent in FY13 (table 8). More
than 80 percent of all FY16 commitments are concentrated in the following four
Global Practices: Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management ($1.7 billion, 33 percent);
Energy and Extractives ($1.25 billion, 24 percent); Water ($0.70 billion, 14 percent);
and Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience ($0.55 billion, 11 percent).

3.    Performance of World Bank operations in the Region is below the World
Bank performance as a whole. Outcome ratings at exit (FY13–15) were 60 percent
moderately satisfactory or better (MS+) for the Region compared with a World Bank
average of 72 percent (figure 1).

4.     IEG rated all projects under five Global Practices MS+ for outcome during the
period: Agriculture (three projects), Environment and Natural Resources (five
projects), Finance and Markets (two projects), Health, Nutrition, and Population
(one project), and Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management (one project). However,
performance is relatively weak for the Education and Water Global Practices. In
Education, IEG rated five of 11 projects (45 percent) as MS+, and for Water, three of
eight projects (38 percent) are rated MS+. For the Social, Urban, Rural, and
Resilience Global Practice, only four of 10 projects (40 percent) are rated MS+ for
FY13–15, which is lower than performance for projects in other Global Practices in
the Region (table 1).

                                                                                APPENDIX I
                                                        REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
5.      Average ratings for projects across IBRD and IDA countries in the Region
during FY13–15 (56 percent and 55 percent MS+, respectively) was below the
Region’s average performance of 60 percent MS+. Five projects in the West Bank and
Gaza (which is not categorized as IDA or IBRD) were all rated MS+, which raised
the Region’s average performance. Two IBRD countries—the Arab Republic of
Egypt and Morocco—are relatively high performers in the region in FY13–15: four of
five projects in Egypt (80 percent) and three of four projects in Morocco (75 percent)
are rated MS+. Projects in other IBRD countries did not perform as well—55 percent
of projects were rated MS+ in Iraq, 56 percent in Jordan, and 43 percent in Tunisia
(table 5).

6.      Middle East and North Africa Region performance for monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) is rated substantial or better for only 26 percent of projects, which is
below an already low World Bank average (32 percent), indicating low overall
satisfaction with M&E design, implementation, and utilization during FY13–15 (table
6).

7.     IEG did not complete any project performance assessment reports (PPARs)
for projects in the region in FY16.

8.     IEG validated 21 IFC investment projects in the Middle East and North Africa
Region in FY13–15 and assigned ratings of mostly successful or higher to 10 projects
(48 percent), slightly below the IFC average of 54 percent. The region’s success rate
by investment commitments was 56 percent, also below the IFC average success rate
of 64 percent (table 2).

9.     The investment climate is particularly challenging in the region. An IEG
Evaluative Note (EvNote) for an IFC investment in Egypt stresses the importance of
clearly defining a project’s development goals, and emphasizes that ensuring client
understanding and commitment to clearly defined developmental goals is necessary
for proper interest alignment and successful implementation. A complementary
lesson identified from a project in Sub-Saharan Africa indicates that investee
management team deficiencies could go undetected during appraisal. Compelling
vision and relationships are not enough for success, and solid investee internal
processes and controls are also needed, even in small project development
companies.

10.    IEG validated 21 IFC Advisory Services projects during the review period
and assigned ratings of mostly successful or higher to 13 projects (62 percent), which
was slightly higher than the IFC average for Advisory Services projects (61 percent).
A key lesson from an IEG EvNote for a successful project suggests careful review of



                                                                                      175

a given company’s capacity to raise enough wholesale funding locally to fund its
growth (table 3).

11.     IEG evaluated and validated two Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) investment projects during FY13–15, both of which were rated satisfactory
or higher (100 percent), which is higher than the MIGA average of 47 percent (table
4). An IEG PPAR recently assessed a MIGA-issued guarantee to two financial
institutions covering their loan to the Tunisian state-owned shipping company for 13
years. A lesson is that MIGA’s non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations
(NHSFO) product can have a valuable countercyclical role in helping projects and
companies with sound fundamentals to access lending and capital markets when it
would otherwise be too costly or out of reach. The PPAR suggests that linking more
closely with the World Bank Group in choosing projects to support with the NHSFO
cover would allow prudent risk management and help MIGA leverage the overall
development impact of its NHSFO interventions. To account for MIGA’s entire
evaluated portfolio, this report takes into account projects that received a positive,
negative and a No Opinion Possible (NOP) rating. The success rates for the FY13-15
period were calculated including projects rated as No Opinion Possible (NOP) in the
total number of projects rated.

Findings from Thematic, Global, and Corporate Evaluations
12.    IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence found that when countries experience situations of fragility,
conflict, and violence, the World Bank Group and the governments may have
differing views on how and when to tackle the underlying issues, which makes
providing effective support particularly challenging (IEG 2016q).

13.     The evaluation notes that, in some situations, such as helping Lebanon and
Jordan with the effects of neighboring crises, finding alternative financing
instruments was a challenge for the World Bank Group. The most readily available
option of IBRD loans was quickly exhausted (and not particularly embraced by the
governments), but the alternative sources and mechanisms (IBRD surplus and trust
funds) were not sufficient to meet needs. An important lesson from this experience
is that the World Bank Group—with its shareholders’ political and financial
support—needs to develop financial mechanisms or fast-response facilities to be
used in similar situations, and use its global convening power more effectively while
encouraging others to do so.

14.   The evaluation draws other lessons about the World Bank’s engagement with
Lebanon and Jordan in the context of the post-2011 crises that affected those

                                                                              APPENDIX I
                                                       REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
countries. World Bank assistance is not likely to alter the fragility profile of both
countries fundamentally, though it is appropriate for addressing the short-term
effects of the refugee crisis. The probability is high that a short-term crisis will
become a serious long-term development challenge. The World Bank Group’s
current strategy design is inadequate to deal with it. The experience in Jordan and
Lebanon shows the importance of maintaining a credible and robust macroeconomic
framework to withstand impacts from unforeseen crises. The World Bank will likely
be an important institution (along with the IMF) in providing financial support
when a crisis occurs. However, without a sustainable macro framework, the World
Bank’s ability to increase its support will be limited. Without drastic structural
reforms, Jordan and Lebanon will continue to be vulnerable to events like the crisis
in Syria. Annex A provides additional cross-regional findings from the evaluation.

15.     Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Development Policy Financing assesses
the application of World Bank Operational Policy (OP 8.60) elements governing
development policy financing related to implementation of the policy’s environmental
and social risk management requirements (IEG 2015i). A project in Morocco was part
of the review sample. The review found that in certain instances social risks were
included in the provision of support for public-private partnerships (PPPs)—for
example, risks associated with establishing an urban code that would affect where
people could live. However, other operations supporting similar reforms (including
the project in Morocco) identified no such risk. Annex A provides additional cross-
regional findings from the learning product.

16.    Given the Region’s ongoing challenges, two recent IEG evaluations
referenced in Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2015 (IEG 2016n)
continue to be noteworthy. First, IEG’s evaluation The Big Business of Small
Enterprises: Evaluation of the World Bank Group Experience with Targeted Support to
Small and Medium-Size Enterprises, 2006–12 distilled the experience of IFC’s West
Bank and Gaza Olive Oil Supply Chain Development Project, in which linking a
group of SMEs that “lack knowledge of required skills and Performance Standards
to operate effectively” to value chains involving large firms enhanced the SME
group’s performance. The evaluation showed the importance of targeting in the
context of developing a financial institution (IEG 2014a). Without targets, financial
institutions may choose to do more corporate lending. Often, targeting small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) also requires the provision of a suite of complementary
supports.

17.   IEG’s evaluation, Investment Climate Reforms: An Independent Evaluation of
World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations, also showed the value of
good targeting. In Morocco, the IFC Alternative Dispute Resolution Project’s


                                                                                    177

awareness-raising campaigns and public outreach efforts used a targeted approach
to attract women to alternative dispute resolution. Awareness-raising events
integrated gender, and commercial mediation and its implication on women
business owners was the focal point of several events, such as a national conference.
IFC also trained women mediators and supported a mediation center (IEG 2015d).

Evaluation Findings from Country Program Performance in the Region
18.    Analysis undertaken for Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2016
shows that for the three countries—Morocco, Djibouti, and Tunisia—in the Middle
East and North Africa Region for which IEG validated two country strategies during
FY07–16, the rating for overall development remained moderately satisfactory (MS)
for Morocco, improved from moderately unsatisfactory (MU) to MS for Tunisia, and
remained MU for Djibouti.

19.   IEG completed two completion and learning reviews (CLRs) for countries in
Middle East and North Africa in FY16. Development outcome rating for the Egypt
CLR (FY06–14) is unsatisfactory, and the Tunisia CLR (FY10–13) is rated MS. World
Bank performance in Egypt is rated fair, and in Tunisia the performance is rated
good (table 7).

20.     The CLR for Tunisia covers FY10–11 (the one year of the country partnership
strategy’s operation before the December 2010 revolution), and FY13–14, which is the
period covered by the subsequent World Bank Group interim strategy note (ISN).
Reflecting the findings of IEG’s Tunisia: World Bank Group Country Program Evaluation,
FY05–12 the CLR is critical of the pre–2011 program, which failed to address critical
bottlenecks that the World Bank knew about because of its own economic and sector
work and other intelligence. Conversely, the CLR concludes that the ISN aimed to
address critical constraints through its focus on sustainable growth and job creation,
promoting social and economic inclusion, and strengthening governance. However,
the CLR finds that the World Bank’s program was overoptimistic about the
government’s ability to make and implement decisions, particularly given the two-
year ISN period and the volatile political context. The program could have been more
realistic and selective, although it did achieve progress in several areas under difficult
circumstances, including support for macroeconomic stability, improvements in the
labor reforms enabling environment, access to basic services, improved social safety
net efficiency, and access to information. Progress was slow for issues such as
unemployment and the transparency and accountability of institutions. IEG rated the
performance of World Bank projects that closed during the CLR period (some of
which were initiated in the early 2000s) as poor—less than 50 percent of 15 projects
received a rating of MS+.

                                                                             APPENDIX I

21.     IFC worked with the World Bank to help strengthen the financial sector
through an investors’ motivation survey, an investment climate assessment, and a
pilot project matching job skills and labor demand. IFC also helped support micro,
small, and medium enterprises through investment and advisory services, and
initiated the Education for Employment Initiative for Arab Youth in Tunisia. IEG did
not rate any IFC investments active in the CLR period, but internal self-rating
suggests a challenging context for private investment (40 percent performing
substandard or worse).

22.    The CPF for Tunisia explicitly references and draws on recommendations
made in IEG’s Tunisia country program evaluation covering FY05–11. The CPF
embraces evaluation recommendations that urge the World Bank Group to do four
things:

      Conduct a political economy analysis to better manage risk in a volatile
       environment—risk mitigation scenarios are needed based on an ongoing
       analysis of risks associated with the political economy and conflict,
       complemented by specific political economy analysis of reforms in critical
       sectors, as needed.
      Galvanize broad public support for reform, which would help to enhance
       stakeholders’ capacity to raise awareness and gradually build ownership of
       the reform agenda, thus helping overcome resistance to change from vested
       interests.
      Selectively and carefully sequence first-order policy reforms (based on the
       political economy analysis) when designing World Bank Group strategy,
       considering capacity and other constraints inherent in the transition period.
      Build government ownership and capacity on how to roll out the reform
       agenda.

23.    The CLR development outcome rating for Egypt during FY06–14 is
unsatisfactory. As in Tunisia, this CLR is unusual because it covers an extended
period that included significant political upheaval, and it deals with two distinct
periods. The first period covers January 2006 to January 2011 and the pro-growth
country strategy that was in operation through the food and financial crises. After
the January 2011 revolution, government commitment to the World Bank Group
program waned, and a modest ISN was put in place that envisioned a development
policy loan for economic management (which was never developed), and an
emergency labor-intensive project. IFC activities were included in the framework in
the main areas of IFC interventions (PPPs, for example). Generally, no outcome
indicators linked directly to IFC activities, which made their contributions more
difficult to evaluate, although IFC broadly contributed to key World Bank Group

program objectives and adapted to changing circumstances and priorities. However,
IFC lost traction on PPPs because of political uncertainties in Egypt during the ISN
period and government reluctance to commit to reforms. Negative perception of the
private sector in the post-revolution period resulted in several reversals of public
asset privatizations and legal challenges to land allocation or to concessions (in
infrastructure, for example), which hindered IFC’s ability to support job creation
and developmental projects. Overall, IEG found that 11 of the 13 country assistance
strategies and ISN objectives were partially achieved or not achieved. Lessons
highlighted in IEG’s CLR review support flexibility in the type of volatile context
encountered in Egypt at various stages, but they also warn against setting objectives
too broadly.

South Asia
Regional Challenges and Evaluation Findings from World Bank Group Operations
in the Region
1.    According to the 2016 South Asia Regional Update, the Region can
potentially transition from having the largest number of poor people to a dynamic
middle-income area by building on its strengths and overcoming barriers to
economic cooperation. Key growth drivers in the region include demographic

                                                                                APPENDIX I
                                                        REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
momentum, urbanization, private sector development, and governance. The South
Asia Region has had one of the highest growth rates in the world in recent years
(almost 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2.5 percent globally), which led to declining
poverty and impressive gains in human development—the bottom 40 percent fared
better than average in all countries in the Region between 2007-2012, except for
India. However, overall prosperity was less widely shared in South Asia than in
most other regions, and factors such as multiple forms of social and economic
exclusion, and susceptibility to natural disasters held the region back. These factors
can potentially impede growth and progress on poverty alleviation. The World Bank
Group strategy for the region is built on mutually reinforcing pillars to support
inclusive growth in South Asia: enhanced support for private sector development,
greater social and financial inclusion, and strengthened governance and security
(World Bank 2016j).

2.     The World Bank’s new lending commitments in the Region peaked in FY14 at
$10.5 billion, representing 26 percent of all World Bank lending in FY14.
Commitments returned to a more typical 18 percent in FY15 at $7.9 billion, and in
FY16 were at $8.4 billion (table 8). Almost 60 percent of all FY16 commitments are
concentrated under the following three Global Practices: Energy and Extractives
($2.13 billion, 26 percent); Water ($1.84 billion, 22 percent); and Macroeconomics and
Fiscal Management ($0.92 billion, 11 percent).

3.     IEG rated the performance of 82 percent of World Bank operations in South
Asia as moderately satisfactory or better (MS+), which is better than the World Bank
as a whole (72 percent MS+). South Asia performed the best of all Regions during
FY13–15, and the difference between outcome ratings (MS+) for projects in South
Asia compared with all other projects is statistically significant (figure 1).

4.      IEG rated all 27 projects under five Global Practices (representing 43 percent of
all rated projects in the Region FY13–15) as MS+: Agriculture (12 projects), Education
(seven projects), Social Protection and Labor (five projects), Environment (two
projects), and Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management (one project). Performance is
marginally below the World Bank average for three Global Practices: five of eight
projects (63 percent) for Energy and Extractives are rated MS+, as are six of nine
projects (67 percent) for Finance and Markets and two of four projects (50 percent) for
Governance (table 1).

5.     IEG rated 78 percent of projects across five IDA countries and 79 percent of
projects across two blend countries as MS+ during FY13–15, which is slightly below
the Region average (table 5). For India (the only IBRD country included in the

analysis), 21 of 22 projects rated were MS+ (91 percent). Within IDA, all seven
projects rated for Nepal and all five for Bhutan were rated MS+.

6.     Consistent with outcome ratings, South Asia also ranked highest in
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) quality in FY13–15 (43 percent of projects rated
substantial or above), which was well above the World Bank average (32 percent
substantial or above) and represented a statistically significant lead compared with
Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean (table 6).

7.      IEG produced two project performance assessment reports (PPARs) in the
region. The Nepal Education for All Project was rated moderately unsatisfactory
(MU) for both development outcome and World Bank performance. Lessons from
the PPAR emphasize the need to enhance learning input quality (such as teachers
and instructional and learning materials) to improve learning outcomes, have a clear
strategy for local capacity development for a decentralized service provision model,
and clarify roles and responsibilities at various levels (central, school district, and
local) for a decentralized model. The project operated at a total cost of $813 million,
of which $703 million was government funding, and $110 million (including $60
million additional financing) was the IDA contribution. The project had three
objectives: ensure access and equity in primary education, improve the efficiency
and institutional capacity of primary education, and enhance the quality and
relevance of basic primary education for children and illiterate adults. At closing, the
project had met its access and equity targets (for example, realizing gender parity).
Other initiatives, such as increased parental awareness and greater community
involvement in education, had been implemented, which contributed to reduced
repetition and drop-out rates (school efficiency), though attendance was still a
problem, particularly among poorer students. However, evidence of improved
learning outcomes was scant, as was evidence to support enhanced institutional
capacity, particularly at the local level. The PPAR found that despite positive efforts
in project supervision, the World Bank underestimated weaknesses in local capacity
and thus mis-calibrated the capacity-building effort required for project
implementation. The PPAR is IEG’s first evaluation of an Education for All Initiative
financed through a sectorwide approach.

8.     IEG produced a PPAR for the Northeast Emergency Irrigated Agriculture
Project in Sri Lanka and rated the project MU for development outcome. The project
objective was to help conflict-affected communities reestablish at least subsistence-
level production and community-based services, and to develop some capacity for
sustainable social and economic reintegration. The PPAR assessed the objective as
relevant, though it notes that human and social capacity development could have had
more emphasis based on the argument that improvements in capacity could have

                                                       REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
contributed to better and more sustainable outcomes. IEG also rated the World Bank
performance as MU based on the evaluation finding of too much emphasis on
hardware rehabilitation and construction at the cost of addressing what it refers to as
“fractured societal dynamics.”

9.      IEG validated 25 IFC investment projects in the Region during FY13–15 and
assigned ratings of mostly successful or higher to 15 projects (60 percent), which was
above the IFC average (54 percent). The Region’s success rate by investment
commitments was 76 percent, also above the IFC average success rate of 64 percent
(table 2)

10.    IEG reviews of IFC investments in the power sector, a priority sector in the
region, show that power generation projects benefit from conservative tariff
assumptions. Associated lessons include the need for contract and financing
structures to be flexible enough to absorb intermittent pressure on cash flow that
might arise from price fluctuations. The sophistication of IFC investees in this region
is highly variable, so environmental and social safeguard work should reflect that
variability. A key lesson from an IEG review of such an investment is that IFC
should have stricter environmental and social reporting requirements for blue chip
companies, especially when IFC has limited leverage in transactions.

11.    IEG assigned a mostly successful or higher rating to 18 of the 29 IFC Advisory
Services projects reviewed during FY13–15 (62 percent), which was slightly higher
than the overall IFC average (61 percent) for Advisory Services projects (table 3).

12.     Projects addressing energy efficiency complement investments in power
generation. An IEG review of such an initiative in Bangladesh found benefit in
focusing on cost competitiveness to demonstrate to clients the business case (based
on actual data collection) for undertaking energy efficiency measures. The lesson
suggests starting small to let firms experience the benefits from energy efficiency
measures and to include local firms in showcasing results. IFC Advisory Services
projects engage the public sector typically through its Trade & Competitiveness
(previously Investment Climate) and Public-Private Partnerships business lines. An
IEG review of such an initiative in a fragile state shows that subproject success
depended on the counterparts’ strength. Consequently, a phased approach is more
effective in such a risky environment, and build counterpart capacity may have to
occur before pursuing other results.

13.   There were no Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
investment projects validated by IEG during FY13–15. To account for MIGA’s entire
evaluated portfolio, this report takes into account projects that received a positive,

period were calculated including projects rated as No Opinion Possible (NOP) in the
total number of projects rated.

Findings from Thematic, Global, and Corporate Evaluations
14.    IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence (IEG 2016q) included Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It notes that
World Bank Group engagement and interest in conflict-affected regions of Pakistan,
where systemic failures of governance and erosion of state legitimacy raises the risk
of violence, varied considerably over time—a heightened focus on specific fragility,
conflict, and violence projects and engagement was evident only since 2010. One of
the four pillars of the 2010–13 country partnership strategy (CPS) was to improve
security and reduce the risk of conflict, focusing on the need to respond to the most
vulnerable and marginalized populations in fragility, conflict, and violence
situations in the country, and emphasize the lack of employment opportunities and
inadequate livelihoods. However, the main causes of fragility were at the heart of
the country’s developmental challenges and often beyond the World Bank’s reach,
sometimes even in initiating dialogue on sensitive topics such as rents distribution
and religious extremism.

15.     In reflecting on the link between national and regional social development
and community-driven development projects in Pakistan, the evaluation notes that
the lack of integration and strategy with how the investments worked in fragile
regions prevented the World Bank program from achieving better results. Much of
these projects’ focus was on delivering commitments instead of identifying expected
changes and using them to determine a way forward. The country team stressed that
in the rural areas of northern Pakistan, projects cannot hope to shift the value system
simply through the provision of assets and services. Entry points for change exist,
but they need to emerge through persistent engagement and committed
partnerships.

16.    The evaluation also notes that supporting the education sector to deal with
issues of fragility is important, particularly relating to psychosocial issues among
children, providing safe spaces for integration and community cohesion to develop,
countering radicalization, and dealing with the problem of so-called lost generations
in more protracted conflicts. The experience in Pakistan showed that even with
small regional commitments and relatively high cost, implementing nationwide
education programs in fragile and violent environments (adjusted to local realities)
can deliver important developmental outcomes and contribute to progress on
conflict mitigation.

                                                       REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
17.     In Sri Lanka, where subnational conflicts with a regional or identity marker
drive conflict, World Bank strategy documents examined the impact of conflict on
development to varying extents and from different vantage points. The 2008 country
assistance strategy (CAS) underscored the need for projects to remain conflict-
sensitive and avoid inadvertently feeding into ethnic tensions. The CAS also warned
that the World Bank had to manage reputational risks deftly to avoid the perception
that it is a biased development partner in a highly sensitive region. The strategy
introduced a conflict filter at the project level in the concept, design, and
implementation stages. The CPS for 2012–16 has less emphasis on conflict than
earlier strategies, focusing instead on the economic transition and how the World
Bank could support growth. The CPS does not unpack or make explicit the
sociopolitical dynamics of Sri Lanka after the war, and without this level of analysis,
it does not make a clear link between efforts to strengthen economic growth and the
need to sustain a durable peace.

18.     The national education program in Sri Lanka incorporated features to address
fragility by expanding project activities to the northern regions and introducing
initiatives such as psychosocial support programs, conflict engagement models,
multiethnic classes, development of multiethnic curriculum materials, and
multiethnic school link programs. Community-driven development was a
mechanism for delivering support to marginal communities (the Second North-East
Irrigated Agriculture Project and the Community Livelihoods in Conflict-Affected
Areas Project). The agriculture project compiled district social baseline profiles that
became analytical insights to work with conflict-affected communities and laid
important foundations for the various World Bank projects that followed. A suite of
projects delivered in the northeast responded to the needs of post-conflict
environments: cash transfers, reconstruction support, housing or shelter,
community-based infrastructure, education support to get children back in schools,
and capacity development programs to reengage regional authorities. Annex A
provides additional cross-regional findings.

19.     Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Development Policy Financing
includes a project in the Punjab to support its assessment of the application of World
Bank Operational Policy elements governing development policy financing (OP8.60)
related to implementation of the policy’s environmental and social risk management
requirements to identify lessons and good practices. The review presents the Punjab
Irrigation Sector Development Policy Loan series as a good example of
environmental and social risk screening. The project’s program document contains
detailed tables in the annex that assess the environmental consequences of each
policy area during the series, noting mitigation measures for identified risks. For
example, the series supported increases in the maintenance and repair budgets of

irrigation works. The document noted that better asset maintenance could
potentially increase water efficiency and reduce waterlogging and salinization, but
also that increased construction activities could have local environmental effects and
risks from changes in water flows, particularly to environmentally sensitive
wetlands. The operation supported a mitigation measure that prepared
environmental guidelines for establishing environmental safeguards for irrigation
activities (IEG 2015i). Annex A provides additional cross-regional findings.

20.     Working with a sample of World Bank and IFC projects from across the
Regions, IEG’s 2016 learning product World Bank Group Support for Housing Finance
sought to generate knowledge and identify lessons regarding support for housing
finance. In India it found that the banks were prohibited from providing mortgage
loans until 1998. To fill the gap prior to 1998, Housing finance companies (HFCs)
were created as providers of mortgage finance. IFC invested in the first HFC and in
others as they were established. The HFCs showed that they could lend responsibly
and profitably by using highly selective credit criteria and personal guarantees to
reduce risk, which compensated for the lack of foreclosure legislation. The HFCs in
India were more resilient to crises because they had diverse funding sources and
adequate, prudent regulations, and they could attract term deposits, borrow from a
liquidity facility, and securitize mortgage loans. In response to legislative and
market changes, IFC supported several HFCs to retain skilled loan officers, and to
establish stringent risk management and pricing, high underwriting standards, and
diverse loan products and credit assessment approaches based on local knowledge
for different customer segments (both payroll and self-employed). The use of
technology and lack of outsourcing collections enabled an IFC-supported HFC to
speed up decision making, maintain a high level of customer services, and closely
manage collections (IEG 2016s). Annex A provides additional cross-regional
findings.

21.    Noting the theme of this year’s Results and Performance of the World Bank
Group (Management for Results), findings from IEG’s evaluation The Poverty Focus
of Country Programs: Lessons from World Bank Experience are worth highlighting. The
evaluation notes that the World Bank could have devoted more attention to the
challenge of poverty monitoring between the five-year survey rounds, especially for
poverty program impact monitoring, short-term interventions, and targeting. It
assessed the data quality, diagnosis, focus of country program design, and
implementation, and the feedback loops between these four links in the causal chain
during the past two decades. The evaluation cites Bangladesh as a good example of
how these elements worked reasonably well in World Bank contributions to
Bangladesh’s poverty reduction and how it could have worked better. World Bank
support to various rounds of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey

(conducted every five years) during a 20-year period created a strong database and
effective partnership, but the engagement could have expanded earlier to include
other key surveys (such as labor force surveys) and could have benefited from more
capacity building at the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. Poverty assessments closely
followed the survey rounds with strong analytic and research links and consistent
messages, though a programmatic approach might have provided more timely
inputs into strategy formulation (IEG 2015j).

22.     It is also useful to refer to IEG’s evaluation World Bank Group Support to
Electricity Access, FY2000–2014: An Independent Evaluation and its evaluation World
Bank Support to Early Childhood Development: An Independent Evaluation. Along with
Sub-Saharan Africa (591 million), South Asia (379 million) has the largest share of
the 1.1 million people with no access to electricity or with inadequate or unreliable
service. The Electricity Access evaluation highlights the relative success of the World
Bank Group’s Bangladesh engagement supporting off-grid capacity. That experience
shows that off-grid solutions—mainly solar home systems, and minigrids and
microgrids—are a fast way to provide energy services to rural and remote areas.
However, the World Bank Group support to off-grid electrification in the past 15
years represents only 1.5 percent of the electricity portfolio during FY00–14 (IEG
2015q).

23.    IEG’s early childhood development (ECD) evaluation highlights the
misalignment between country needs in ECD and World Bank engagement (IEG
2015s). Similar to electricity access, the need is greatest in South Asia and Sub-
Saharan Africa (for example, in Bangladesh, between one third and one half of
children aged less than five suffer from stunting), but World Bank Group
engagement was generally weak. Bangladesh had little improvement in nutritional
status during 2004–10. More recently, the World Bank Social Protection and Labor
team conducted pilots and evaluations of cash transfer systems that improved the
nutritional status of children in Bangladesh. In Nepal, the World Bank was actively
involved in country dialogue on nutrition and its analytical work focuses heavily on
nutrition. In this instance the World Bank recommended addressing malnutrition
through a multisector approach, and the government responded by approving a
multisector nutrition plan and establishing appropriate coordinating institutions.
The evaluation notes that the World Bank Group typically engaged on a fragmented,
sector-by-sector basis that is inadequate to address critical multisectoral issues such
as nutrition.

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE

Evaluation Findings from Country Program Performance in the Region
24.     Analysis undertaken for Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2016
shows that for the five countries—Bhutan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri
Lanka—in the South Asia Region for which IEG validated two country strategies
FY07-16, the rating for overall development remained moderately satisfactory (MS)
for Bhutan and India, improved from MU to MS for Bangladesh, and remained MU
for Pakistan. The Sri Lanka country strategy was rated three times, and its overall
development outcome rating improved from MU to MS and remained at that level
after IEG’s third validation.

25.    IEG completed two completion and learning reviews (CLRs) for the region in
FY16. The CLR development outcome rating for both the CPS FY11–15 for
Bangladesh and the CPS FY13–16 for Sri Lanka is MS. World Bank performance is
rated good for Bangladesh and fair for Sri Lanka (table 7).

26.    IEG’s review of the Bangladesh CLR notes the remarkable progress the
country made in reaching lower-middle-income status in 2015, showing progress in
poverty reduction, gross domestic product growth, exports, and human
development. When the CAS was in development, the government had already
placed poverty and inequity at the center of its development strategy, which
ensured CAS ownership and buy-in. The CAS sought to support government
ambitions through accelerated, sustainable, and inclusive growth, supported by
stronger governance at the central and local levels. The CAS was organized around
four objectives: consolidating human development gains, accelerating growth,
reducing environmental degradation and vulnerability, and strengthening
governance. IEG’s review notes that the CAS may have been too broad in its scope,
and also refers to the cancelation of it calls a cornerstone project (the Padma Bridge
Project, planned in cooperation with the Asian Development Bank and the Japan
International Cooperation Agency), which had a detrimental effect on the portfolio
as a whole. Plans for several new operations to replace the Padma Bridge Project
were overambitious given staff constraints and implementation challenges. The CAS
progress report tightened the World Bank’s program, which led to dropping some
outcomes (from 16 to 11) because of a lack of progress. The CAS eventually showed
progress in many areas, including health outcomes, social safety nets, primary and
secondary education completion rates, agricultural productivity, and power
capacity. However, educational quality did not improve as envisioned, governance
improvement was only modest, and the environment for private sector investment
remained challenging despite strong IFC commitments of nearly $900 million in 29
projects. The outcome indicator for 2.1 (improved environment for private sector
investment, Doing Business Ranking) was not achieved. Unfortunately, this outcome’s

indicator (and the results framework in general) did not integrate IFC, which means
that attribution for IFC input cannot be measured. It is useful to note that IFC’s
support and signaling effect due to the investment climate does not influence the
Doing Business Ranking. The CLR highlights several lessons, including the need for
selectivity, and that results-based lending can be effective in advancing policy
change and in increasing disbursements.

27.     IEG’s review of the CLR for the CPS for Sri Lanka FY13–16 found the World
Bank Group’s strategy was relevant to the government’s development vision
through its focus on three engagement areas: facilitating sustained private and
public investment, supporting structural shifts in the economy, and improving
living standards and social inclusion. A fourth focus area was added at the 2014 CPS
progress report stage in response to client priorities (improving resilience to climate
and disaster risks). Apart the relevance of strategic focus, IEG’s review finds that the
World Bank Group could have exercised greater selectivity in setting its
development objectives. The CPS included several objectives not backed by
sufficient interventions to attribute meaningful results (on public investment and
nutrition, for example). Adjustments made through the CPS instilled greater realism
to the program, but one important operation (the Investment Policy Reform
Development Policy Loan) was delayed, and three operations were dropped
(including the Legal and Judicial Reforms Project), indicating weak ownership for
policy reforms. However, the review found that IFC’s investments and advisory
services complemented the World Bank’s role on investment climate, access to
finance, and climate resilience. The overarching lessons from IEG’s review are the
need for selectivity, clarity of World Bank Group objectives and outcomes, and a
realistic results framework with an explicit and credible results chain.

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE

Cross-Regional Findings
1.      IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group Engagement in Situations of Fragility,
Conflict, and Violence focused on such situations, which are predominantly, though
not exclusively, found in middle-income countries. The evaluation found the World
Bank Group and governments may have differing views on how and when to tackle
the underlying issues, which makes providing effective support particularly
challenging (IEG 2016q). The World Bank Group’s comparative advantage in such
circumstances is in supporting countries in tackling long-term development
challenges, including early engagement, sustained presence, and continuous
dialogue. The World Bank was adept at adjusting its strategies and analytical
support to such situations, but its limited choice of instruments constrained its
operational response. Furthermore, institutional and staff incentives to engage in
situations of fragility, conflict, and violence are not yet commensurate with the spirit
of its strategic approach. The community-driven development model often provided
the World Bank Group with a useful point of entry in conflict-affected areas,
establishing a presence and contextual learning to support efforts that are more
ambitious once peace is restored. The World Bank Group can further enhance its
impact in these situations by exploring opportunities beyond supporting livelihoods
in conflict-affected communities, including supporting private sector development,
using its expertise in public financial management more effectively, and improving
its M&E frameworks.

2.      The evaluation makes recommendations at the strategic and operational
levels. At the strategic level, it recommends a review of the institutional setup and
interaction of various World Bank Group units dealing with fragility, conflict, and
violence matters to ensure cross-cutting thinking on strategy and policy. It also
recommends developing a new, multidimensional, publicly disclosed system of
markers and flags for monitoring and measuring fragility (including in countries
that are not in fragile and conflict-affected situations) and the systematic integration
of fragility assessments as part of the systematic country diagnostic and country
partnership framework (CPF) process. The final, strategic-level recommendation is
to scale up regional presence and outlook, such as through regional projects and
provision of joint advisory and analytic services across relevant countries. At the
operational level, the evaluation recommends development of new financial
mechanisms or fast-response facilities as necessary (for example, cofinancing small
pilot programs in areas affected by fragility, conflict, and violence, with potential for
scaling-up). The evaluation also recommends expanding sector interventions
beyond the community-driven development model, and improving coordination
and information sharing within the World Bank Group. Another operational-level

                                                      REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
recommendation is to develop institutional incentives for collaboration and strategic
thematic guidance on partnering (particularly with the UN, but also with other
partners) and to introduce systematic communication and staff exchange programs
to increase the level of collaboration.

3.     The evaluation classified the cases reviewed under four categories of stress
factors that raise the risk of violence:

      Subnational conflicts with a regional or ethnic identity market
      Violence related to organized crime and drug trafficking
      Systemic failures of governance and erosion of state
      Overwhelming

4.     Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Development Policy Financing
assesses the application of the elements of the World Bank Operational Policy
governing development policy financing (DPF)—OP8.60—related to
implementation of the policy’s environmental and social risk management
requirements to identify lessons and good practices. IEG found that World Bank
policy is vague and lacks clear definition of key concepts. Guidance and training
materials vary in quality, utility, and relevance. Furthermore, pressure to deliver
operations quickly, and the lack of a formal role for environmental or social
specialists provides disincentives for task leaders in setting priorities for managing
environmental and social risks in development policy operations (DPOs). The
review is positive about the inclusion of environmental and social themes and risks
in the World Bank’s new tools and processes, such as the Systematic Operations Risk
Rating Tool (SORT), the SCD, and the CPF. IEG also identifies several lessons,
including the value of clear and updated guidance for task teams, early and
consistent inclusion of environmental and social considerations, and strong
messages from management of World Bank Group institutions about the importance
of supported projects’ environmental and social aspects (IEG 2015i).

5.     Working with a sample of World Bank and IFC projects from across the
regions, IEG’s 2016 learning product World Bank Group Support for Housing Finance
sought to generate knowledge and identify lessons regarding support for housing
finance. World Bank Group support to housing finance represents a small portion of
the entire portfolio FY05–15 (279 projects valued at $5.2 billion approved in 73
countries). Overall, IFC (investments and advisory services) accounted for the
highest share of housing finance projects by number of projects (59 percent), and the
World Bank (lending and nonlending) accounted for the highest share by
commitment value (58 percent) because of a relatively larger average project size.

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
The volume of World Bank Group support to housing finance decreased post-crisis,
particularly for IFC (IEG 2016s).

6.     Key lessons identified in IEG’s review of housing finance include the
following:

      • Commercial banks are logical partners in housing finance projects, but they
        need to be fully committed to mortgage lending.
      • Sustainability can be enhanced when there is a strong, well-timed, and
        sequenced link between lending and advisory services.
      • A needs assessment is fundamental to design interventions tailored to
        specific country needs.
      • When expanding affordable housing is a key objective of an intervention, it
        needs to be targeted, and the results adequately measured.
      • If there is no mortgage financing, the low-income segment should not be
        prioritized, but should be introduced gradually.

7.      IEG’s 2016 learning product Lessons from Land Administration Projects: A
Review of Project Performance Assessments synthesizes cross-cutting findings and
lessons from IEG’s assessments of World Bank–supported projects dealing with
often complex and politically fraught land administration issues. IEG compared
World Bank Group experience across projects using different institutional structures
to manage two important elements of a land administration system—registry, which
records the rights to land, and the cadaster, which provides information on the
location, boundaries, use, and values of land parcels. The comparison suggests that
no single model is best for performing these functions. The review also emphasizes
that making land tenure more secure is a process, not a single event, and the concept
of land tenure and associated rights is highly context-specific, meaning there are no
absolute, generally applicable standards for defining tenure security. Most of the
projects reviewed did not explicitly target the poor or vulnerable groups, reflect
social inclusion in their objectives, or sufficiently report on social impacts across
projects. Experience shows that social impacts need to be monitored and not
assumed, even when laws and procedures are nominally the same for all potential
beneficiaries (IEG 2016j).

8.     Transformational engagements are a crucial pillar of the World Bank Group’s
current strategy. IEG’s 2016 learning product Supporting Transformational Change for
Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity identified a sample of such engagements from
2000–14 and found that although it may be difficult to identify transformational
engagements ex ante, some salient characteristics can be identified ex post (IEG
2016p). Most of the engagements supported fundamental change in a market,
system, or behavior. Large-scale impacts were achieved through scaling up,

replication, or demonstration effects, and a significant degree of the intervention
effects were sustained. IEG’s analysis suggests the World Bank Group can enhance
the likelihood that interventions will catalyze faster development progress by taking
a programmatic approach that addresses systemic and behavioral change based on a
sound diagnosis of binding constraints. This does not necessarily mean more
complexity in individual interventions, but rather a thorough understanding of the
main constraints and issues. Adopting a programmatic approach can facilitate a plan
of selective and sequenced interventions that can help address the constraints to a
country or sector’s development.

9.     The Quality of Results Frameworks in Development Policy Operations, a 2015 IEG
learning product, presents the results of a review of the World Bank’s DPF portfolio
based on a sample of operations from across the World Bank Regions. IEG found
that World Bank projects mostly strike a good balance between breadth and
specificity when defining lending objectives. The review finds the introduction of
Strategic Country Diagnostics in planning may help strengthen DPF policy focus
even further through the systematic identification of binding constraints. The review
notes that building strong results frameworks depends heavily on identifying prior
actions (actions that a country must meet to demonstrate its commitment to seeing
through the policy reforms). In this respect, IEG found a wide variation in World
Bank experience, from examples of excellence to instances in which prior actions
were not credible or deep enough to trigger change. In many cases, IEG attributed
weaknesses in prior actions to weak implementation of programmatic series instead
of the original design and found examples of significant deterioration in the quality
of prior actions because of not implementing triggers, to the extent that the World
Bank likely would not have approved the final operations as stand-alone operations
(IEG 2015l).

10.     IEG’s 2015 evaluation World Bank Support to Early Childhood Development: An
Independent Evaluation found that World Bank sector strategies in health, education,
and social protection feature early childhood development (ECD). These sector-
based structures tend to seek entry points for engagement with countries in ECD
with the corresponding public sector authorities. IEG found that country strategies
have limited discussion of the ECD interventions embedded in their programs, and
suggests properly integrating ECD interventions into County Partnership
Frameworks. According to the evaluation, a positive correlation exists between
analytical work on ECD and subsequent successful World Bank operations (IEG
2015s).

Appendix J. IEG Note on Global Practices
Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions Global Practice
Cluster
1.     The Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions (EFI) cluster consists of five
global practices:

         Finance and Markets: seeks to develop resilient, efficient, and transparent
          financial systems to help mobilize capital needed for investments in country
          development priorities.
         Governance: develops innovative, integrated solutions to pernicious
          institutional problems using a problem-driven, diagnostic approach that
          combines knowledge of reform successes and failures with a keen
          understanding of institutional challenges and opportunities in developing
          countries.
         Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management: provides integrative development
          strategies, policy-based lending, macro data, global perspectives, real-time
          policy analysis, country risk assessments, and innovative projection tools.
         Poverty: seeks to deliver advice and integrated knowledge to identify key
          policies and multisectoral solutions that effectively reduce poverty and benefit
          the less well-off, and to help better understand the relationship between
          growth, poverty, and inequality.
         Trade and Competitiveness: helps countries develop more dynamic and
          integrated economies by boosting trade, enhancing the investment climate,
          improving competiveness in sectors, and fostering innovation and
          entrepreneurship.

2.     The Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions (EFI) cluster is the World
Bank’s second largest Global Practice cluster by commitments. The cluster’s
commitments in FY16 were $13.7 billion, which is 30 percent of total World Bank
lending (table 1). In comparison, total FY16 commitments for the Sustainable
Development cluster were almost $25 billion (54 percent of total World Bank
commitments) and $7.6 billion for the Human Development cluster (16 percent of
total World Bank lending).

                                                        REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
3.    For the current review period, FY13–15, 69 percent of all projects in the
Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions cluster were rated MS+, which is below
the World Bank average of 72 percent (figure 3).

4.     During the three-year period FY13–15, 62 percent of the investment projects in
the EFI cluster were rated moderately satisfactory or better (MS), which compares to
the 73 percent MS+ average rating for investment projects in the other two clusters in
the same period. On a three-year rolling average basis since FY01, the percentage of
EFI cluster investment projects rated MS is consistently below the average across the
other two clusters (figure 1 panel b).

5.      Development policy financing (DPF) performance within the cluster has
traditionally been stronger when compared with the other two clusters. However,
performance began to improve across the other clusters since FY09–11, and the
average DPF performance for the other clusters is now marginally better than that in
the EFI cluster—85 percent MS+ versus 82 percent MS+—during FY13–15 (figure 1
panel c).

6.      Three-year rolling average ratings for IDA and IBRD projects in the cluster
show IBRD projects consistently outperforming IDA projects, and the performance
gap is widening (figure 2 panel a). During FY12–14, IBRD projects in the EFI cluster
outperformed IDA projects 77 percent MS+ to 60 percent MS+. The latest three-year
rolling average shows IBRD performing at 86 percent MS+ while IDA projects remain
at a 61 percent satisfaction level. IBRD projects in the cluster also outperform the
average ratings for IBRD projects across the other clusters (86 percent versus 71
percent MS+, respectively) during FY13–15 (figure 2 panel b). IDA projects perform
well below the average ratings for IDA projects across the other clusters (61 percent
versus 76 percent MS+, respectively) in the same period (figure 2 panel c).

7.      Investment projects in three Global Practices were rated at or above the cluster
average (69 percent MS) during FY13–15: Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management
(82 percent), Finance and Markets (74 percent), and Poverty (71 percent).
Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management performance during FY13–15 is above the
corporate target for Global Practice performance of 75 percent MS+ by FY17. The
Governance practice ranked the lowest of the five Global Practices with a rating of 56
percent MS+, and the gap between Governance and other Global Practices is
statistically significant in FY13–15 (figure 3).

8.    Disaggregated by World Bank Regions during FY13–15, EFI cluster projects
were rated 85 percent MS+ for the Europe and Central Asia Region, and 81 percent
MS+ for the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. These two high-achieving



                                                                                     207
APPENDIX J
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
Regions outperformed the others: EFI projects in the Middle East and North Africa
Region were rated 67 percent MS+, those in the South Asia Region were rated 64
percent MS+, and projects in both the Africa and East Asia Pacific Regions lagged at
59 percent and 58 percent MS+, respectively (figure 4).

9.     IEG rated the EFI cluster’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) quality for FY13–
15 as 36 percent substantial, which compares favorably with a 31 percent average
rating across the other clusters. Within the cluster, the M&E rating for projects in the
Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management and the Finance and Markets practices was,
respectively, 46 percent and 44 percent substantial, and the M&E rating for projects in
the Poverty practice was 43 percent. Other Global Practices in the cluster rated lower
than the cluster average, with Trade and Competitiveness rated 28 percent
substantial, and Governance rated 24 percent substantial (figure 5).

Main Evaluation Findings and Lessons
10.   This section summarizes key findings and lessons from IEG’s major
evaluations, learning products, and project performance assessment reports (PPARs)
completed during FY12–15 and relevant to the EFI cluster.1

Major Evaluations and Learning Products

11.    IEG’s evaluation of the World Bank’s Group’s contributions to client
countries’ capital market development spans all areas of capital market
development as well as the use of capital market instruments in Bank Group
support. It examines the relevance, effectiveness and sustainability of Bank Group
interventions with particular reference to the period FY04-14.

12.    The evaluation finds that the World Bank Group followed broadly correct
strategic directions at critical points, especially, in emphasizing public goods aspects
and venturing to develop new markets and asset classes. In terms of issuers and
instrument, early emphasis on local currency government bond markets reflected
global concerns in the wake of the Asian crisis. The Bank Group’s response was
innovative, if only partially successful. Both the World Bank and IFC Treasuries also
supported the development of local capital markets through their local currency
bond issues.




1Findings and lessons related to IFC, MIGA, and public-private partnership operations
relevant to the Equitable Growth, Finance, and Institutions (EFI) cluster were included in
this section even though they may not be under the EFI cluster’s direct responsibility.

                                                                            APPENDIX J
                                                      REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
13.    IFC’s early support for emerging market asset classes, including contributions
towards the building of investability indices, proved pioneering. Its later move away
from support for developing stock markets towards private equity reflected its
frontier role, although exits through public offerings were rare and returns mixed. In
developing instruments such as asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, the
World Bank Group’s role was sometimes ahead of its time. On the investor side, IEG
found little focus on asset management or capital market investment in most
interventions in insurance and pensions, although this might have aided their
sustainability.

14.    The Bank Group’s convening power has been evident in contributions to
global payments fora as well as in the development of Green Bond principles. Yet
Bank Group use of capital markets instruments or project bonds for infrastructure
financing in its own transactions was small; guarantees however were an important
instrument.

15.     Overall, coherence across areas of engagement was weak. Attempts to
develop markets through Treasury bond issues could have had more sustained
impact if linked to operational and advisory support. Investors could have been
better linked to issuers and instruments, and limited use was made of underlying
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) diagnostics. Program fragmentation
partly reflected reliance on external or unusual financing sources.

16.   IEG points out that ultimately the credibility and impact of this largely
knowledge-based practice area rests on developing, maintaining, and disseminating
information. If the World Bank Group is to develop the capacity to contribute as an
innovator, there is clear scope for improvement in knowledge generation as well as
knowledge management. IEG accordingly recommends that the World Bank Group:

       Integrate capital market development within the World Bank Group across
        different areas;

Enhance the use of the FSAP instrument to underpin capital markets interventions’
design.

       Strengthen knowledge management and develop a frontier global
        knowledge program; and
       Review funding sources and their impact upon program design.

IEG’s learning product on housing finance particularly relates to the Finance and
Markets Global Practice. The report notes that hundreds of millions of people live in
inadequate conditions with little or no access to decent housing (IEG 2016s).


                                                                                    209
APPENDIX J
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
Housing finance is crucial to the functioning of the housing market. Creating
sustainable and effective housing finance requires the mobilization of long-term
sources of funding for both rental and owner-occupied housing, which is often
missing in emerging markets. In response, the World Bank Group’s approach
evolved from using traditional stand-alone operations to the development of more
strategic and comprehensive solutions, including supply-side interventions (such as
reducing legal and regulatory constraints) and demand-side interventions (such as
provision of guarantees and financing).

The learning product aimed to provide lessons from experience about successful
practices from World Bank Group housing finance projects. Analysis shows that the
World Bank Group allocates resources primarily to countries with low mortgage
penetration rates and with the most need. Despite its important role, the World Bank
Group has limited resources to support housing finance, thus requiring a selective
and strategic approach in the face of growing need. Furthermore, the dedicated staff
and resources it deploys have both fallen below the pre-2008 financial crisis levels,
creating challenges to achieve more with less.

Summary findings from the housing finance learning product include the following:

         Commercial banks willing to provide mortgage loans are logical partners in
          housing finance projects, but they need to be fully committed to mortgage
          lending.
         Non-bank financial institutions have strategic weaknesses that endanger their
          long-term viability, and they might need to diversify funding sources, expand,
          or convert themselves into a bank.
         Sustainability can be enhanced when there is a strong link with advisory
          services, but it has to be adequately timed.
         Preconditions exist for the development of capital markets and primary market
          interventions, and if these preconditions are not in place, adequate sequencing,
          timely interventions, and committed sponsors can have compensating effects.
         A needs assessment is fundamental to design interventions tailored to specific
          country requirements.
         When expanding affordable housing is a key objective of an intervention, it
          needs to be targeted and the results adequately measured.
         If there is no mortgage financing, the low-income segment should not be
          prioritized, but should be introduced gradually (IEG 2016s).

The IEG learning product on The Role of Political Economy Analysis in Development
Policy Operations is particularly relevant to the Macroeconomics and Fiscal
Management practice. The report reviews the extent to which political economy

                                                                               APPENDIX J
                                                        REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
analysis is used to improve development policy operation (DPO) design and how
effective it was. The main messages are:

      Political economy analyses can be used to assess countries’ eligibility for
       budget support, provide important insights on the political feasibility of
       specific reforms supported by DPOs, inform specific design elements of
       important reform actions in a programmatic series (including choices of
       programmatic instruments versus stand-alone operations, or front-loading
       versus back-loading), and, as part of self-evaluation, to better analyze factors
       affecting program effectiveness and to contribute to knowledge and improved
       design of subsequent operations.
      Political economy analysis customization specifically for DPO reform priorities
       is probably underprovided—most such analyses used in DPOs are geared
       toward countrywide governance and institutional issues. This may be
       associated with reliance on national development strategies signaling national
       ownership, variation in the institutional depth of reform areas, budget
       pressure, and other factors.
      Setting better priorities for World Bank–supported reforms and assessing the
       risks of specific reform actions may strengthen DPOs’ results orientation
       regarding policy and institutional change, and may increase demand for
       political economy analyses (IEG 2016o).

IEG has not recently undertaken a dedicated evaluation of projects mapped to the
Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice in aggregate, but recent major evaluations
provide specific lessons relevant to the practice. Critical challenges from the
evaluation World Bank Group Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship: An
Independent Evaluation include the following:

      Articulating a clear vision of how innovation will be used to solve major
       development problems and how this vision can be transformed into workable
       solutions.
      Enhancing coordination, consultation, and links on innovation and
       entrepreneurship initiatives across networks, sectors, and regions, and across
       the World Bank Group institutions.
      Developing practical solutions for people who earn less than $2 a day through
       sustained efforts to experiment with different mechanisms and implementation
       arrangements and to scale up successful models (IEG 2013c).

From the IEG evaluation Investment Climate Reforms: An Independent Evaluation of
World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations, critical challenges in
investment climate (regulatory reform) include the following:


                                                                                      211

From Industrial Competitiveness and Jobs: An Evaluation of World Bank Group Industry-
Specific Support to Promote Industrial Competitiveness and Its Implications for Jobs, critical
challenges include the following:

      a. Better articulating the World Bank Group’s approach to industry-specific
         competitiveness work and ensuring a consistent treatment across the World
         Bank Group (a function clearly associated with the Trade and
         Competitiveness).
      b. Strengthening (in line with the Sustainable Development Goal 9.2) the World
         Bank Group’s industry level support to inclusive and sustainable
         industrialization.
      c. Integrating a jobs perspective into the World Bank Group’s industry-specific
         support to competitiveness (IEG 2016e).

Project Performance Assessment Reports

Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management
IEG completed PPARs for projects in some, but not all, Global Practices in FY16. Three
PPARs on budget support in Ghana and four PPARs on policy-based guarantees
(PBGs) in the Balkans are relevant to the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management
practice. (The PPARs covering budget support in Ghana are also relevant to the
Poverty practice and are presented under that heading.) The four PBGs evaluated in
the Balkans were the Montenegro Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee, Serbia
Private and Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia Policy-Based Guarantee, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Public Expenditure Policy-Based Guarantee.

The PPAR for the Montenegro Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee evaluates
the guarantee of €60 million implemented in 2012–13, which supported a
commercial loan of €100 million. The PBG had one objective: strengthening the
banking system. Although the objective was highly relevant, the program design
had weaknesses associated with the lack of operational focus on the program’s
macroeconomic framework, and risks and shortcomings in assessing Montenegro’s


212
                                                                             APPENDIX J
                                                      REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
eligibility for a PBG. The achievement of the objective was modest, even though the
banking system largely recovered from the crisis. The anticipated reform program
remains incomplete, with gaps in crisis management, a failure to fully comply with
the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, and slower than
expected decline in nonperforming loans. This evaluation notes that many
important outcomes achieved in Montenegro’s banking system were attributable to
strong reform actions supported by the predecessor Financial Sector Development
Policy Loan, underscoring the PBG’s relatively low value added.

The PPAR for the Serbia Private and Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee
reviews a guarantee approved on February 10, 2011. The operation’s objectives
included facilitating Serbia’s access to international markets and assisting the
country in achieving longer tenor and lower interest terms on its external
commercial loans. They also included enhancing the business environment to
support private sector investment, strengthening financial discipline with continued
reform of the non–private enterprise sector (particularly focused on bankruptcy),
and building a stable and more efficient financial sector through continued
restructuring of state holdings in banking, crisis preparedness, support to insurance
sector development, and promoting the development of capital markets. The
guarantee covers the principal amount of a commercial bank borrowing $400 million
with a six-year bullet maturity on a non-accelerable basis. The PBG’s relevance,
design, and results largely met the high expectations of financial and policy reform
objectives specified at the outset. The World Bank took a calculated risk with the
new instrument to respond to the client’s request for a much larger volume of
financing than was possible under the development policy loan (DPL). The
government managed to double maturity and substantially lower the cost of
borrowing, leading to Serbia independently and regularly accessing international
markets on favorable terms and long-term maturities. Policy reform objectives also
showed high achievement (15 of 18 outcome indicators were fully achieved and one
was partially achieved). The evaluation established that most reforms were
sustained, several reforms were deepened, and outcomes improved further as time
passed. In one area (enhancing financial discipline), required actions were also
completed and outcomes were achieved and sustained, but it was about two-and-a-
half years before these reforms achieved renewed momentum in late 2014 and in
2015, in the context of new IMF and World Bank support programs.

The PPAR for the FYR Macedonia Policy-Based Guarantee assesses a guarantee
approved on November 10, 2011. The objectives of the operation were to improve
the government’s access to international financial markets, fortify public finance
sustainability and labor market functioning, strengthen social safety nets, and
support financial sector resilience. The PBG’s relevance, design, and results met the

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
expectations of financial and policy reform objectives. As with the Serbia PBG, the
World Bank took informed risks with the new instrument to respond to the client’s
request for a much larger volume of financing than would have been available
under a DPL. The reform agenda showed moderate achievements and sustainability.
The objectives linked well to the PBG’s design and the desired outcome of the
country eventually accessing markets independently. Policy reform objectives were
appropriate based on a record of solid macroeconomic and fiscal management
characterized by low fiscal deficits and moderate public debt levels, good policy
dialogue, extensive consultation, and past analytical work. Prior actions linked to
objectives, and were limited in numbers, relevant, and concrete. Achievement of
financial objectives was substantial. The government managed to raise the required
funds and extend maturity of external borrowing using the PBG, which lead to FYR
Macedonia independently accessing international markets on favorable terms.
Policy reform objectives showed mixed achievement. Critical actions and outcomes
in the financial sector were substantially achieved, though achievement was modest
in strengthening public finances and labor market functioning and in strengthening
the social safety net. The emergence of health sector arrears and other payment
arrears during implementation and supervision undermined the overall
achievement. PBG-supported reforms proved important to budget and banking
sector resilience, allowing the sector to absorb adverse economic and external

The PPAR for the FYR Macedonia Public Expenditure Policy-Based Guarantee
evaluates a guarantee of €155 million implemented in 2012–13. The PBG supported a
commercial loan of €250 million. This was the country’s second PBG in the aftermath
of the global crisis. The guarantee had three specific objectives: improving public
expenditure efficiency by strengthening public financial management practices,
improving service provision efficiency in the health sector, and strengthening social
protection and inclusion. These objectives were substantially relevant to World Bank
and government strategies and country context. However, IEG rated the program
design as modest because it lacked operational focus on the program’s
macroeconomic and fiscal risks, and the public financial management reform
agenda’s scope was relatively narrow at a time of heightened risks. The achievement
of objectives was mixed. IEG rated the efficacy of the first objective (improving
public expenditure efficiency by strengthening public financial management
practices) as modest. The program helped to achieve clearance of the arrears
identified in the program and introduce changes in treasury practices to prevent
accumulation of future arrears, but data gaps at the central level limited reporting,
and actual arrears at the municipality level and in the health sector remain quite
large. Furthermore, the capital expenditures efficiency deteriorated and is

                                                     REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
concerning. The second objective (improving service provision efficiency in the
health sector) was substantially achieved. The program helped reduce the unit price
of pharmaceuticals and some medical equipment considerably, though the
implication of these changes for budgetary savings in 2013–15 was less evident—an
increase in the number and cost of prescriptions offset the positive impact of unit
price reduction. Service provision to underserved areas improved through the
introduction of a new framework that helped direct more resources to those areas.
Achievement of the third objective (strengthening social protection and inclusion)
was also substantial. Improving access of vulnerable groups to social services and
generating fiscal savings strengthened the government’s active labor market
programs. In social protection, the program helped improve targeting considerably.
Fiscal resources freed up because of improved targeting enhanced the levels of
financial assistance to beneficiaries.

The four PPARs produced a range of important lessons, and the following are key:

      PBGs can be a useful instrument for supporting countries facing large external
       financing needs. The instrument may be relevant for many countries seeking to
       strengthen access to international financial markets while advancing policy
       reforms. It fills the niche between commercial borrowing and traditional DPOs
       while providing borrowers with better-than-commercial terms and larger
       volumes than would be available under a DPO, allowing the World Bank to
       take informed risks to support client needs promptly.
      PBGs implemented in a context of challenging macro-fiscal situation and large
       financing needs must incorporate a consistent macroeconomic framework with
       necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.
      Strong, relevant design and high achievement are much more likely when the
       operation’s design is informed by considerable knowledge work, intensive and
       long-term World Bank engagement and dialogue, and a relationship of trust
       between the World Bank and the borrower.
      The borrower can be highly motivated to deliver on reforms, partly because of
       a trust relationship with the World Bank, the large volume of borrowing, and
       perhaps because of a third-party presence (a foreign commercial bank
       providing funding, for example), which puts additional pressure on the loan
       timing and closure.
      A PBG can unlock multiple benefits for the borrower that may not be easily
       captured by alternatives such as a standard DPL—for example, borrowing a
       larger amount (because of the World Bank’s set-aside policy, which accounts
       for only one-quarter of the PBG against the country’s borrower limit), and
       opening the door to substantial subsequent international borrowing at
       favorable terms based on an established record.


                                                                                  215

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
         PBGs are associated with the risk of debt repayment (as with any large loans,
          especially with a guaranteed component). A strong policy reform program
          focused on key macro and structural issues with relevant prior actions are
          essential to guard against the possibility of reduced incentives for the borrower
          to exercise caution in borrowing and implementing reforms.
         Comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported debt instruments
          with counterfactual market rates may not be enough for assessing the extent of
          reduction in the borrowing costs associated with the transaction. Estimating
          the change in sovereign risk perception is a challenging task, but it may give a
          more accurate assessment of the program’s impact.

Governance
IEG prepared six PPARs in FY16 that are particularly relevant from the Governance
perspective. The assessments had two broad themes. In Rwanda and Tanzania, the
theme was strengthening decentralization, local governance, and community
empowerment, with special emphasis on decentralization process, form, and
manifestation through empowering and building capacities at the local level. (The
Rwanda project is under Social Protection and Labor, and the Tanzania project is
under Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience, and each is referenced under its particular
heading. The cross-relevance of the projects’ governance-related components supports
including them here.) The second theme (in Malawi, Zambia, and two PPARs in
Vietnam) was strengthening public financial management, civil service reform, and
oversight institutions, with special emphasis on the design, implementation, and
utilization of financial management information systems (FMIS).

A PPAR in Rwanda evaluated the Rwanda Decentralization and Community
Development Project, which was developed based on government resolve that
decentralization and democratization were necessary to reconcile the Rwandan
people. Decentralization was a core element of the government’s good governance
agenda under its first poverty reduction strategy (2002–05). It was also enshrined in
the country’s 2003 constitution as a way to strengthen national unity and
reconciliation and to bring national government closer to the people. The project
was designed to contribute to Rwanda’s long-term goal for decentralization through
empowering communities and improving local government accountability. The
project’s development objective was to boost the emergence of a dynamic local
economy through empowering communities to lead their own development process
under effective local government.

A PPAR in Tanzania evaluated the Local Government Support Project. The project’s
development objectives were to strengthen fiscal decentralization and improve local

government resources accountability and intergovernmental transfer systems
management, and to increase access to infrastructure and services in the unplanned
areas of Dar es Salaam and improve revenue performance for sustainable operation
and maintenance. The project was the first World Bank operation in Tanzania to
support the Local Government Reform Program and, in particular, the
intergovernmental transfer system. The government’s 1998 policy paper on local
government reform, which was implemented in two phases (1998–2008 and 2009–
14) with mixed results, underpinned the decentralization effort, articulating a vision
of a system of autonomous local governments.

The Rwanda and Tanzania PPARs focused on strengthening decentralization, local
governance, and community empowerment, and provided the following lessons:

      Well-designed participatory processes to promote demand-side governance
       and empower communities, along with intensive institutional and capacity
       building at the central and local levels, can foster decentralization in a post-
       conflict environment (Rwanda) with a history of highly centralized structures
       and dominant central government. The project in Rwanda provided the
       building blocks for fostering community participation and local accountability,
       and enhanced social cohesion through financing subprojects that communities
       identified through a participatory planning process that feeds into the districts’
       annual action plans.
      Decentralization and capacity building is a long-term process that needs
       sustained government and World Bank engagement (Rwanda and Tanzania)
       and buy-in from other stakeholders.
      Flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances is crucial to the operation’s
       continued relevance and success in a rapidly evolving environment (Rwanda).
       The project’s ability to respond quickly after a major territorial reform and
       rapidly evolving decentralization priorities was essential to its success in
       achieving development objectives.
      Rapid scaling up poses challenges to capacity, particularly when capacity is
       uneven and resources are limited. In Tanzania, the decision to expand
       gradually at the outset was warranted, but the subsequent rapid expansion to
       all local government agencies created challenges that seriously strained the
       system’s capacity and credibility.
      The decentralization agenda cuts across sectors. Therefore, interventions
       within and across sectors and supporting broader government public sector
       reforms need to be well coordinated to guarantee real synergies and impact.

The PPAR for the Malawi Financial Management, Transparency, and Accountability
Project assessed World Bank support in public financial management and civil service


                                                                                      217

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
reform to facilitate sound economic management. It also assessed the effective and
accountable use of public resources to address core challenges (for example, 75
percent of the population was living on less than $1.25 per day). The project involved
investment in a financial management information system (FMIS), strengthening
public financial management processes and accountability institutions, and
developing civil service capacity. Considerable progress in basic implementation was
achieved across the various areas, but the systems did not lead to the expected
benefits because compliance was not sufficiently enforced (for example, spending
units were reported to maintain an off-FMIS registry). Failure of the underlying
institutional and accountability environment also led to a major corruption episode,
despite the systems in place.

The PPAR for the Zambia Public Sector Management Program Support Project notes
that the project operated in a country that had been peaceful and politically stable
for most of its post-independence history. However, Zambia had a national poverty
rate of about 60 percent and extreme poverty of about 42 percent in 2010. Zambia is
generously endowed with natural resources, but it relied most heavily on copper,
which exposed it to fluctuations in global demand. The macroeconomic situation
had worsened since 2011, which led to a high current account deficit and a decline in
mining-related investments. Expenditure adjustments were commensurate with
reduction in revenue, and the fiscal balance deteriorated from a 1.8 percent deficit in
2010 to 7.7 percent in 2015. Against this background, the project aimed to contribute
to making public service delivery institutions more effective and efficient through
strengthening public financial management and reforming the civil service. The
achievement of project objectives was mixed, reflecting achievement of significant
process outputs (integrated FMIS and payroll management and establishment
control), but also failure to translate these into tangible outcomes because of political
considerations and because various systems were bypassed or not used properly.

IEG conducted a PPAR for the Vietnam Public Financial Management Reform
Project and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Public Financial Management
Modernization. Vietnam, a one-party socialist state dominated by the Communist
Party of Vietnam, has moved toward a pragmatic, growth-oriented approach to
economic policy since the 1990s. The country has experienced remarkable economic
and social development during the past three decades, even though economic
growth has been somewhat slower and the pace and the depth of reforms more
modest since the international financial crisis. Vietnam was one of the poorest
countries in the world in 1986 and is now a middle-income country, with some
development indicators comparable to those of OECD members. The Public
Financial Management Reform Project’s development objectives were “to strengthen
the borrower’s capacity to (i) plan, (ii) execute and (iii) report on its budget and to

improve the (iv) transparency and (v) accountability of the budgetary systems and
processes.” The Public Financial Management Modernization Project’s objectives
were “to support Vietnam to strengthen its capacities for: (a) increased (i)
coordination and (ii) transparency in public finance management; (b) improved
revenue mobilization; and (c) (i) effective and (ii) efficient public expenditure
management.” The project achieved its various objectives principally on the
successful implementation of a treasury and budget management information
system, development of the debt database, and piloting the medium-term
expenditure framework in four ministries and three regions. The approach is being
mainstreamed as a result.

The three PPARs that focused on strengthening public financial management, civil
service reform, and oversight institutions with a special emphasis on the design,
implementation, and use of FMIS produced several lessons, including the following:

      A functioning FMIS alone is not sufficient to achieve good public financial
       management. To be effective, the ministry of finance must clearly commit to
       routing all transactions through the system so that all expenditures are subject
       to the FMIS automated, ex ante, and internal controls (Malawi, Vietnam).
      An FMIS should include all government expenditures to act as a fiscal and
       budget management tool (debt payments, fiscal transfers, the capital budget,
       extrabudgetary funds, and internally generated funds). Donor funds should
       also be channeled through the FMIS—this can be done and still retain their
       own accounting mechanisms and fiduciary safeguards (Malawi, Zambia).
      Systems deployment strategies should make sure that a large part of the
       budget is covered from the outset. A major portion of the budgetary resources
       should be subjected to ex ante budget and cash control so that meaningful
       fiscal control and cash management are possible early in the deployment
       (Vietnam).
      Implementing all FMIS modules simultaneously is difficult and rarely feasible.
       Instead, a sequenced rollout approach that sets priorities for core treasury
       reforms can be beneficial and ensure that client capacity is not overburdened
       (Zambia).
      Sequencing public financial management reforms is important to avoid
       unnecessary complexity and ensure smooth and orderly introduction of
       desired reforms. Advanced budgeting techniques, such as program- and
       activity-based budgeting, should be introduced only after a fully functioning
       FMIS is in place (Zambia, Vietnam).
      Changing an FMIS platform carries substantial risks. It is costly and time
       consuming, the change provides no guarantee of eventual fit and functionality,
       human capacity will be lost and needs to be rebuilt, and the reform focus

REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
          during the transition period will be on technical issues instead of the
          underlying public financial management environment (Malawi).
         Good analytical work is important for program design, but program design
          must also be strategic, practical, and prioritized, and it must consider the
          borrower’s implementation and absorptive capacity (Zambia).
         Consolidating fragmented bank accounts takes significant political will.
          However, it might be given low priority in times of economic growth and fiscal
          expansion. Idle balances should be of particular concern to countries prone to
          external shocks because not having a treasury single account means these
          funds cannot be used to cushion against unanticipated financing gaps
          (Zambia).
         Financing government employee retrenchment can be deeply unpopular and
          carries significant reputational risk for the World Bank. The intervention is
          unlikely to be effective without accompanying complementary reforms, and
          progress should be closely monitored to avoid reentry of civil servants
          (Zambia).
         Merit-based recruitment of senior civil servants is a crucial aspect of
          performance management. Performance contracts are of limited value if senior
          civil servants are politically appointed and can be dismissed arbitrarily
          (Zambia).
         Donor coordination modalities should be carefully considered before project
          inception and designed to reduce transaction costs (Zambia).
         Explicit recognition of the iterative nature of reform is important. For example,
          project design based on a complex institutional reform agenda and its
          implementation would benefit from provisions for frequent, in-depth
          supervision to inform periodically on critical intervention areas that may need
          adjustment and priorities (Zambia). Public financial management reforms need
          decades to complete—in this context, continued, effective provision of financial
          support and, more important, knowledge by development partners will be
          needed (Vietnam).
         A flexible approach to M&E can be useful. For example, an evolving project-
          level M&E might be a good way to respond to the iterative, demand-driven
          nature of activities that do not allow clear, measurable objectives to be set from
          the start. Approaches such social media may be informative and cost effective.
          Stand-alone studies and assessments provide important complements to
          results-based M&E (Vietnam), and M&E with periodic, complementary
          assessments strengthen project implementation.

                                                       REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
IEG produced three PPARs in FY16 that are relevant to the Finance and Markets
Global Practice. The first two looked at PBGs in Serbia and in Montenegro. The main
lessons from the two PPARs conducted for the PBGs include the following:

      PBGs can be a useful instrument for supporting countries facing large external
       financing needs.
      PBGs could be relevant for many countries seeking to strengthen access to
       international financial markets while advancing policy reforms, filling the
       niche between commercial borrowing and traditional DPOs while providing
       borrowers with better-than-commercial terms and larger volumes than would
       otherwise be available under a DPO.
      The World Bank can productively take informed risks with new and
       innovative instruments to support client needs promptly that would not have
       been possible with standard World Bank support instruments.
      PBGs implemented in a context of challenging macro-fiscal conditions and
       large financing needs benefit from incorporating a consistent macroeconomic
       framework with necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.
      The choice of a PBG as an instrument should be based on robust macro and
       fiscal projections indicating that the financing framework is sustainable and
       macro risks are mitigated.
      Comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported debt instruments
       with counterfactual market rates may not be enough for assessing the extent of
       reduction in the borrowing costs associated with the transaction.
      Estimating the change in sovereign risk perceptions, although challenging,
       may give a more accurate assessment of the program’s impact.
      Strong and relevant design and high achievement are much more likely when
       considerable knowledge work, intensive and long-term World Bank
       engagement and dialogue, and a relationship of trust between the World Bank
       and the borrower informs the operation’s design.

The PPAR for the Arab Republic of Egypt Mortgage Finance Project provides the
following lessons:

      Housing finance is not the exclusive domain of formal financial institutions. In
       designing projects, a good understanding of the various formal and informal
       market players that affect and would be affected by the intervention is
       important.
      Developers are usually well positioned to assess and manage home buyer and
       borrower credit risk, but their financing activities raise some concerns.
      If functioning bond markets are not in place, the mortgage liquidity facility
       would not be able to perform its most critical role as central bond issuer.


                                                                                    221
APPENDIX J
REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
         Even if bond markets are functional, high and persistent inflation may make
          the mortgage liquidity facility impotent.
         To compete with banks, the mortgage liquidity facility needs large-scale
          operations and frequent visits to the bond markets to reduce the cost of
          operations. If the mortgage markets are too small, the mortgage liquidity
          facility will not be competitive.
         If mortgages are predominantly fixed rate, the case for adopting a mortgage
          liquidity facility is stronger.

Poverty
IEG prepared one PPAR under the Poverty Global Practice in FY16 that is also
relevant to the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management practice. The assessment
evaluates three consecutive DPOs in Ghana during 2009–12. The World Bank
committed $300 million in 2009 through a two-tranche economic governance and
poverty reduction credit (EGPRC). A programmatic series of two poverty reduction
support credits (PRSCs) followed: PRSC-7 provided a credit of $215 million in 2011,
and PRSG-8 provided a grant for $100 million in 2012.

The objective of the Ghana EGPRC, disbursed in two tranches for a total of $300
million, was “to support the authorities’ three-pronged effort to restore budgetary
discipline and tackle long-standing public sector and energy issues, while protecting
the poor.” The objectives of PRSCs 7 and 8 were similar to the EGPRC’s and
included restoring budget discipline and financial stability, tackling long-standing
public sector and energy issues, protecting the poor, and preparing the economy for
the oil era (including managing expected oil revenues).

The EGPRC contributed to reducing the fiscal deficit between 2008 and 2011 from
8.4 percent to 3.2 percent, and poverty decreased substantially across the country,
coinciding with a faster-than-expected implementation of the Livelihood
Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP) Program expansion it supported. IEG rated
this part of the reform as substantial. However, another part of the program
achieved only modest results. Utility companies’ reforms were never fully
operationalized, and the government continued to set administrative fuel retail
prices that were too low. Furthermore, only a few civil service reforms were
undertaken, and wages increased. PRSCs 7 and 8 achieved substantial efficacy in
social protection and oil revenue management, but only modest achievement in
fiscal discipline and public sector reforms. Ghana decided on a fiscal expansion
before the 2012 election that erased stabilization gains made during the previous
EGPRC operation. Monetary accommodation of the fiscal deficit produced high
inflation and persistent pressure on the exchange rate. Macroeconomic stabilization

                                                      REGIONAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
was achieved only in 2015. Modest results were achieved related to long-standing
public sector and energy issues. However, the LEAP Program continued to produce
positive results in poverty reduction. Ghana also established institutions that could
allow transparent oil revenue management and account for intergenerational
considerations by creating the Ghana Heritage Fund for accumulating oil revenues
for the next generations.

The EGPRC and two PRSC operations in Ghana generated the following lessons:

   Prudent macro-fiscal management is important for countries that were supported
    under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), and the World Bank
    can in ensuring this through policy lending that helps clients preserve borrowing
    space and safeguards sustainability of pro-growth and pro-poor expenditure in
    the long term. Furthermore, adequate macroeconomic management is a critical
    precondition of budget support—the World Bank is no substitute for the IMF in a
    challenging context that requires a comprehensive macroeconomic program, and
    Ghana is a good example of World Bank–IMF cooperation in this regard.
 DPOs deployed in an extremely weak public financial management environment
    are unlikely to be successful. Ghana experienced a deterioration in resource
    allocation during 2008–12 because of debt-financed expenditure hikes that led to
    interest payments of about 7 percent of gross domestic product per year by 2016,
    taking precious resources away from pro-poor spending, thus undermining
    Ghana’s overall growth and poverty reduction agenda and the effectiveness of the
    World Bank’s budget support. This emphasizes that the quality of public resource
    use in both public financial management and allocations is an important
    precondition of budget support success.
 Donor coordination on budget support can be difficult in a challenging
    environment. Despite a move toward performance criteria based on agreed
    actions, various donors may interpret emerging shocks differently, and this can
    affect donor coordination. Dealing with macro and fiscal mismanagement when
    the macro framework is not formally a part of the performance assessment can be
    especially contentious.
 Fiscal pressure can crowd out discretionary expenditures, and service delivery
    sectors are especially vulnerable. The World Bank can use DPF operations to take a
    crucial role in protecting pro-poor expenditures in such an environment.
The World Bank has a crucial role in providing advisory services that are
complementary to budget support. In Ghana, a more proactive engagement in
estimating the fiscal impact of the salary reform introduction could have helped in
designing a phased approach consistent with the long-term budgetary envelope.

Human Development Global Practice Cluster
The Human Development cluster consists of three Global Practices:

      Education: supporting countries that request financing or technical assistance
       to reach Sustainable Development Goal 4, which calls for access to quality
       education and lifelong learning opportunities for all by 2030.
      Health, Nutrition, and Population: promoting universal health coverage, and
       providing financing, advanced analysis, and policy advice to help countries
       expand access to quality, affordable health care. It also sets priorities for
       protecting people from falling into poverty or becoming poorer because of
       illness, and promotes investments in all sectors that form the foundation of
       healthy societies.
      Social Protection and Labor: supporting well-functioning social safety nets
       proven to reduce poverty and inequality, promoting access to health and
       education among poor children, empowering women, and supporting
       sustainable social insurance programs that help cushion the impact of crises on
       households. It supports promoting effective policies for productive
       employment that help people access labor markets and accumulate skills in
       normal times and during recovery from economic crisis.

The Human Development cluster is the World Bank’s smallest Global Practice
cluster by commitments. The cluster’s commitments in FY16 were almost $8 billion,
which is 16 percent of total World Bank commitments (table 1). In comparison, total
FY16 commitments for the Sustainable Development cluster were almost $25 billion
(54 percent of total World Bank lending), and FY16 commitments for the Equitable
Growth, Finance, and Institutions cluster were $13.7 billion (30 percent of total
World Bank lending).

Performance Trends
For the current review period, FY13-15, 77 percent of projects in the Human
Development cluster were rated MS+, which is above the World Bank average of 72
percent (figure 3). The percentage of Human Development cluster investment
project financing projects rated moderately satisfactory or better (MS+), on a three-
year rolling average basis since FY04–06, was somewhat lower than that of the other
two clusters before it made progress and surpassed performance in those clusters in
the last three analysis periods.

During FY13–15, 77 percent of the investment projects in the cluster were rated
MS+—which compares to the 69 percent MS+ rating for the other two clusters


                                                                                   229

in the same period (figure 1 panel b). Development policy financing (DPF) within
the cluster has been slightly stronger than the average across the other two clusters
until the performance gap began widening since FY10–12. The ratings for DPF in the
Human Development cluster in the current period (FY13-15) is 88 percent MS+
compared with an average 82 percent MS+ across the other two clusters (figure 1
panel c).

Three-year rolling average ratings for IDA and IBRD projects in the cluster are
broadly similar over time, though a slight gap opened in FY13–15 when IBRD
projects performed better than IDA projects—78 percent of IBRD projects were MS+
versus 74 percent of IDA projects (figure 2 panel a). IBRD projects in the cluster
outperform the average ratings for IBRD projects across the other clusters (78
percent versus 74 percent MS+, respectively) between FY13–15 (figure 2 panel b).
IDA projects perform at just above the average for IDA projects across the other two
clusters (74 percent and 72 percent MS+, respectively) during FY13–15 (figure 2
panel c).

Ratings for 90 percent of the 40 projects rated in the Social Protection and Labor
Global Practice during FY13-15 were MS+ in the review period, which is well above
the corporate target of 75 percent MS+ by FY17. However, 74 percent of 80 projects
under Education and 73 percent of 67 projects under Health, Nutrition, and
Population were rated MS+, which is slightly below the FY17 corporate target
(figure 3).

Disaggregated by World Bank Regions, 89 percent of 19 Human Development
projects for the South Asia Region were rated MS+, as were 80 percent of 25 projects
rated in the East Asia and Pacific Region, 79 percent of 66 projects rated in the Africa
Region, and 78 percent of 36 projects rated in the Latin America and the Caribbean
Region. The Human Development cluster rating for the Europe and Central Asia
Region was 70 percent MS+. Performance for projects in the Human Development
cluster lagged for the Middle East and North Africa Region at 61 percent MS+
(figure 4).

The cluster’s overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) rating for FY13–15 is 37
percent substantial or better, which is above the average for other clusters (31
percent substantial) and the overall World Bank average (32 percent substantial).
Coincidental with a high development outcome rating, projects in Social Protection
and Labor also performed particularly well regarding M&E (50 percent substantial).
The M&E rating for Health, Nutrition, and Population (37 percent substantial) was
also better than the portfolio average, and the M&E rating for Education projects
was 31 percent substantial (figure 5).

Main Evaluation Findings and Lessons
1.    This section summarizes key findings and lessons from IEG’s major
evaluations, learning products, and project performance assessment reports (PPARs)
completed during FY13–16 and relevant to the Human Development cluster.

Major Evaluations and Learning Products

Education
2.    IEG did not disclose any major evaluations or learning products relating to
the Education Global Practice in FY16, but its evaluation of World Bank Group
support for higher education FY04–15 will be disclosed in the latter half of FY17. The
evaluation analyzes the World Bank Group’s role in promoting equitable access,
employable skilled graduates, and research and innovation, and intends to be
forward-looking because it seeks to understand how well it aligns with the World
Bank’s twin goals in its current context.

Health, Nutrition, and Population
3.     IEG is in the process of evaluating World Bank Group support for health
services. The evaluation (scheduled for disclosure in late FY17) will collect evidence,
develop lessons, and propose recommendations that could enhance World Bank
Group support to country clients as they move toward universal health coverage.
The following are the evaluation’s overarching questions: What has the World Bank
Group’s role and contribution been in supporting health services? What should the
World Bank Group’s role and contribution be in supporting health services,
considering its comparative advantages? The evaluation will cover all IBRD and
IDA projects, IFC investments and advisory services, World Bank advisory services
and analytics, and partnership programs and multidonor trust funds approved
during FY05–16.

4.     IEG’s learning product Public-Private Partnerships in Health: World Bank Group
Engagement in Health PPP: An IEG Synthesis Report (IEG 2016l) is a desk-based
portfolio review of existing evidence associated with the engagement of all World
Bank Group institutions in health PPPs. The report identifies lessons from successful
and failed efforts to structure health PPPs approved during FY04–15. The study
identifies five lessons:

   • IFC and the World Bank jointly should analyze the entire range of options with
     government clients—from the public and mixed options to potential PPPs
     models—considering the health sector context, country capacity, and its track
     record in PPPs.


                                                                                    231
APPENDIX J
IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
      • World Bank Group support to health sector reforms and policy work could be
        better integrated with PPP structuring and financing.
      • Distributional and affordability aspects should be considered at the design
        stage and systematically tracked during PPP implementation.
      • The World Bank–IMF jointly developed PPP fiscal risk assessment model could
        be applied to structuring PPPs with potentially substantial fiscal implications.
      • Systematic preparation of post-completion reports for IFC operations
        supporting PPP would allow for assessing health PPP results considering their
        long contractual duration.

5.    IEG evaluations and reports completed in recent years that were cited in the
Human Development Global Practice Update section of Results and Performance of the
World Bank Group 2015: An Independent Evaluation (IEG 2016n) include:

         World Bank Support to Early Childhood Development: An Independent Evaluation,
          which examined the World Bank’s design and implementation of operations
          (FY00–14) that support interventions for young children and their families. The
          evaluation recommends that the World Bank adopt a well-coordinated and
          strategic framework for early childhood development (ECD), use analytic work
          on ECD in preparing systematic country diagnostics to determine need,
          increase knowledge to address key ECD operational challenges, and improve
          the M&E of ECD intervention (IEG 2015s).
         IEG’s learning product, Delivering the Millennium Development Goals to Reduce
          Maternal and Child Mortality: A Systematic Review of Impact Evaluation Evidence,
          found that appropriately designed interventions are more likely to yield
          significant results in countries with a larger burden, such as lower skilled
          birth attendance rates or higher mortality. Households with lower
          socioeconomic status realized larger benefits from these interventions, but
          utilization among the poor remains a challenge (IEG 2016c).
         An evaluation of World Bank Group support for health financing reform
          during FY03–12, which provides the following key findings and
          recommendations: technical capacity and government commitment greatly
          facilitate reform; the poverty and equity effects of health financing need more
          attention; health financing requires a particular skill set—IEG advises that
          Global Practices expand staff technical capacity and focus on health financing
          as a comparative advantage; collaboration across public sector and health
          teams and between the World Bank and IFC was limited; and the quality of
          M&E is weak in World Bank and IFC operations and needs to be strengthened
          to better analyze the impact of World Bank and IFC operations on final

      IEG’s learning product, Later Impacts of Early Childhood Interventions: A
       Systematic Review on the impacts of interventions during early childhood on
       later outcomes found that early childhood interventions can, but do not
       always, lead to benefits later in life in cognition, language, education, and the
       labor market. Evaluated interventions have not shown consistent long-term
       advantages for physical development, although these outcomes are less salient
       to adult welfare. Nutrition interventions may need to be in place throughout
       and beyond the first 1,000 days to take advantage of the window of
       opportunity from conception to the child’s second birthday and achieve
       sustained effects beyond early childhood. Sizable knowledge gaps persist, but
       careful planning and design can close the gaps (IEG 2015f).

Social Protection and Labor
6.      IEG did not produce any major evaluations or learning products relating to
social protection and labor in FY16. The most recent major evaluation IEG
conducted in this area was the systematic review of social safety sets and gender,
detailed in the 2015 update. The study found that men and women respond to and
benefit differently from social safety nets. It also found that not everybody in the
household benefits equally from them because men, women, boys, and girls have
different roles, responsibilities, and constraints, and they typically respond
differently to incentives. The evaluation highlights the need to identify expected and
desired gender results at preparation and address them in the project, and the need
to collect more gender-disaggregated data in project M&E.

Education
7.    A PPAR for the Education for All Project (2004–09) in Nepal, a primary
education project that the World Bank and four other donors jointly financed
through a sectorwide approach (SWAp), distilled four lessons:

      Emphasizing the quality of learning inputs (such as teachers and instructional
       and learning materials) is important to improving the quality of education,
       particularly learning outcomes.
      In a low-capacity environment, a strategy to build local-level capacity is critical
       in a decentralized service provision model.
      Central, district, and local-level roles and responsibilities should be clearly
       defined when education provision is decentralized.
      Quality assurance in M&E data is essential when funding links to school-level
       data.

8.    IEG conducted a PPAR for the Millennium Science Initiative Project in
Uganda (approved on May 25, 2006, became effective on March 2, 2007, and closed
on June 30, 2013). The PPAR’s main lessons are as follows:

         Although research funds are common in OECD countries, it is also possible to
          establish and implement a world-class science research fund in a low-income
          country.
         An appropriate cost-sharing agreement is needed at entry to facilitate
          sustainability.
         Promoting a knowledge-based economy requires an integral approach
          involving several ministries and the private sector.
         A research fund is a viable mechanism to increase research and create
          programs for science and technology graduates, but its impact may be
          enhanced by extending capacity building and technical assistance to grantees.
         Requiring data collection for grants may also yield better impact or at least a
          clearer understanding of what was achieved.
         The low numbers of Ugandan women scientists, merits attention from a gender
          perspective.

Health, Nutrition, and Population
9.     IEG conducted PPARs for two projects in Niger. The Institutional
Strengthening and Health Sector Support Project was supported by an IDA credit of
special drawing rights (SDR) 24.2 million (approved on January 5, 2006), and the
Multisector Demographic Project was supported by an IDA grant of SDR 6.7 million
(approved on June 19, 2007). The PPARs reviewed project documents, aide-
mémoires, supervision reports, data, and studies. Planned fieldwork was not
conducted because of Niger’s security situation. The PPARs’ key lessons are as
follows:

         The SWAps’ capacity-strengthening potential (including program-wide
          support) is not likely to be achieved without clear capacity-strengthening
          objectives and viable institutional arrangements, intermediate objectives, a
          plausible results chain, relevant performance indicators, and proactive M&E.
         A SWAp’s success (or failure) depends on four critical factors: the quality and
          relevance of strategies and annual work plans; country capacity and systems
          for financial management, procurement, and strategic management; the quality
          and functionality of partnerships with national and international actors and
          stakeholders; and the predictability and flow of funds and the absorptive
          capacities of implementing agencies.

      Improved quality and relevance of strategies and plans for health and
       population might have contributed to the support of fewer, more relevant
       activities and a higher impact.

Social Protection and Labor
10.   IEG conducted a PPAR for the Third Malawi Social Action Fund Project,
Adaptable Program Loan II, which is a community development fund project
approved on June 20, 2008, and completed on June 30, 2014. The main lessons drawn
from the project are as follows:

      Community-driven development can facilitate decentralization, but the right
       balance must be struck between community priority setting and local
       development planning.
      Assessing institutional capacity at the design stage and systematically during
       implementation is crucial, especially when the project includes a component on
       capacity building at the local level.
      Beneficiary feedback throughout the assessment provides important evidence
       of the operation’s impact from the beneficiaries’ perspective.
      Subproject economic and financial costs should consider the affordability of
       subprojects in poor communities.
      Linking income generation interventions with asset building opportunities can
       help build economic resilience.

11.    IEG also completed a PPAR for the Second Tanzania Social Action Fund, a
community development fund project implemented during FY05–12. The main
lessons drawn from the project are as follows:

      Mainstreaming the social fund subproject process at the local government level
       can strengthen decentralized planning outcomes.
      Community participation in the local planning process does not ensure that
       community priorities are realized.
      When poverty alleviation is the underlying goal, as in the Tanzania Social
       Action Fund, a combination of interventions can be effective.
      Setting realistic guidelines can improve subproject outcomes.

Sustainable Development Global Practice Cluster
1.     The Sustainable Development cluster consists of six Global Practices and two
cross-cutting solutions areas. The six Global Practices are as follows:

      Agriculture: aims to link farmers to markets to increase food availability and
       stimulate general economic growth using a value chain approach, including
       on-farm inputs, land, water, financial services, and post-harvest agro-
       processing.
      Energy and Extractives: sets priorities for improving the energy investment
       climate by promoting sector reform and governance, strengthening utilities,
       enhancing investment frameworks, encouraging private participation, and
       rationalizing subsidies.
      Environment and Natural Resources: seeks to promote a green, clean, and
       resilient world in which natural resources are managed to support livelihoods
       and strong economies, and to share prosperity by transferring wealth from
       downstream beneficiaries of ecosystem services to upstream communities
       that carry the opportunity costs of protecting nature.
      Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience: gives priority to ensuring that
       marginalized and vulnerable populations have a voice in defining the growth
       of cities, human settlements, and rural areas, which have local and global
       implications for sustainability and climate change.
      Transport and Information and Communication Technologies: seeks to
       promote virtual and physical connectivity, to improve the movement of
       people, goods, and information, thus enabling access to economic
       opportunities, to vital services like healthcare and education, and to
       knowledge and ideas.
      Water: aims to ensure that water is a reliable foundation for poverty
       reduction and shared prosperity by delivering public water goods coupled
       with private initiatives to add value to water services throughout the water
       cycle.

The two cross-cutting solutions areas are:

      Climate Change: aims to help country clients accelerate efforts to tackle
       climate change and deliver on their national climate plans.
      Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): provides strategic, leadership, and
       coordination support for the provision of basic services. PPPs introduce
       private sector technology, innovation, and funding to public services.

IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
2.      The Sustainable Development cluster is the World Bank’s largest Global
Practice cluster by commitments. The cluster’s commitments in FY16 were almost
$25 billion, which is 54 percent of total World Bank commitments (table 1). In
comparison, total FY16 commitments for the Equitable Growth, Finance, and
Institutions cluster were $13.7 billion (30 percent of total World Bank lending), and
$7.6 billion for the Human Development cluster (16 percent of the total World Bank
lending).

Performance Trends
3.     For the current review period, FY13-15, 71 percent of all projects in the
Sustainable Development cluster were rated MS+, slightly below the World Bank
average of 72 percent (figure 3).

4.     Taken on a three-year rolling average basis since FY01, the percentage of
investment projects rated MS for the cluster was somewhat higher than that of the
other two clusters before narrowing toward convergence in ratings since FY08–10
(figure 1 panel b). However, the development policy financing (DPF) performance
within the cluster has traditionally been weaker when compared with the other two
clusters until it began moving toward convergence since FY07–09. The rating for
Sustainable Development DPFs in FY13–15 is 83 percent MS+ compared with an
average of 83 percent MS+ across the other two clusters (figure 1 panel c).

5.     Three-year rolling average ratings for IDA and IBRD projects in the cluster
were broadly similar between FY07–09 and FY10–12. Since then, a gap in
performance began opening in FY13–15 when IDA projects performed better than
IBRD projects—77 percent of IDA projects were MS+ versus 69 percent of IBRD
projects (figure 2 panel a). IBRD projects in the cluster also underperform average
ratings for IBRD projects across the other clusters (69 percent versus 82 percent MS+,
respectively) in FY13–15 (figure 2 panel b), and IDA projects outperform average
ratings for IDA projects across the other clusters (77 percent and 68 percent MS+,
respectively) in the same period (figure 2 panel c).

6.      Projects in two Global Practices in the cluster were rated above the cluster
average (71 percent MS) during FY13–15 and above the corporate target (75 percent
MS+ by FY17). In Transport and Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT), 79 percent of projects were rated MS+, as were 79 percent of projects in
Agriculture, which performed particularly well between FY10–12 and FY13–15. The
Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience practice scored at the average (71 percent), and
the other Global Practices performed below the cluster average: 68 percent for Water,

66 percent for Energy and Extractives, and 62 percent for Environment and Natural
Resources (figure 3).

7.     Disaggregated by World Bank Regions during FY13–15, 84 percent of 44
Sustainable Development projects rated for the South Asia Region were MS+, as
were 79 percent of 63 projects rated in Europe and Central Asia, and 76 percent of 94
projects rated in the East Asia Pacific Region. The other three Regions performed
below the cluster average of 71 percent MS+: 68 percent of 85 projects rated in Latin
America and the Caribbean, 66 percent of 122 projects rated in Africa, and 59 percent
of 34 projects rated the Middle East and North Africa (figure 4).

8.    IEG rated the Sustainable Development cluster’s monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) quality for FY13–15 as 29 percent substantial compared with a 37 percent
average rating across the other clusters. Within the cluster, the M&E rating for
Energy and Extractives projects was a strong 48 percent substantial, which is well
above the next highest rated Global Practice (29 percent for Agriculture). All other
Global Practices rated lower than the cluster average (figure 5).

Main Evaluation Findings and Lessons
9.    This section summarizes key findings and lessons from IEG’s major
evaluations, learning products, and project performance assessment reports (PPARs)
completed during FY12–16 and relevant to the Sustainable Development cluster.

Major Evaluations and Learning Products

10.    After IEG’s major electricity access evaluation (IEG 2015q), IEG produced the
learning product Financial Viability of the Electricity Sector in Developing Countries:
Recent Trends and Effectiveness of World Bank Interventions. The learning product
compiles a comprehensive inventory of World Bank electricity sector investments
and development policy operations (DPOs) approved during FY00–15 that contain
components and covenants for improving sector financial performance and viability.
Findings suggest that leveraging investment operations and DPOs with technical
assistance and analytical work will yield better and more sustainable results. Key
lessons and conclusions include the following:

      Addressing the political economy of sector financial viability is key because
       measures such as tariff adjustments toward cost recovery levels, which are
       crucial to setting the electricity sector on the path to long-term financial
       viability, can be politically sensitive. As such, aligning the DPO program’s
       timeline with that of a government reform program, matching the scale of



                                                                                   243

IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
          World Bank support to the scope of reforms and political risk, and balancing
          the window of opportunity with achievable targets should be considered.
         Simple designs and realistic time frames are preferable—an overambitious
          agenda and too many loan conditionalities in DPOs can affect performance.
         Retaining focus on the underlying structural causes of sector financial
          viability and using programmatic series of single-tranche policy loans can be
          effective in supporting a well-specified, medium-term financial recovery
          program (IEG 2016c).

11.     The IEG learning product Reliable and Affordable Off-Grid Electricity Services for
the Poor: Lessons from World Bank Group Experience highlights good practice country
program experiences in supporting commercially viable and rapidly scalable off-grid
access and services provision models and institutional frameworks. These include
supply and service delivery chains for solar home systems and microgrids, and the
technologically and commercially fast-evolving pico-solar products and their
growing transformative record. These experiences took different routes in
mainstreaming off-grid electrification in line with their own needs and context. In
Bangladesh, the scaled-up solar home systems program in grid-proximate areas took
hold as an opportunistic market response to the then-stalled grid extension
program. Off-grid electrification in Sri Lanka (isolated village hydro minigrid
networks, initially) grew from a strategy anchored by an island-wide spatial
electrification plan, and implemented as staged preelectrification until the planned
grid extensions arrived at those locations. Off-grid electrification in Rwanda and
Kenya is proceeding as planned. Morocco is an example of the planned
preelectrification cycle transitioning to mostly grid-based electrification. Myanmar,
drawing on previous good practice experiences, also began a conscious strategy of
ex ante planned preelectrification, designing an off-grid program that promotes
solar products, solar home systems, and isolated minigrid networks coordinated
with grid expansion (IEG 2016m).

12.    The IEG learning product Lessons from Environmental Policy Lending provided
operationally relevant lessons from World Bank DPOs to inform the design of
environmental and other sectoral development policy lending. The learning product
provides several key insights. First, environmental development policy lending is
most effective when it uses the instrument’s strengths—that is, when policy issues
are the main barrier to improving environmental outcomes instead of capacity or
other issues. Development policy lending offers advantages for achieving
sectorwide or multisectoral goals, especially for policy issues that need attention
from high-level decision makers. It can be most effective when the World Bank has
prior knowledge of the country and sector, and strong institutional relationships
that can be developed through use of other instruments. Another insight is that a


244
                                                                             APPENDIX J
                                                           IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
few key design and implementation considerations tend to determine how effective
environmental policy lending can be. Policy lending is most effective when a clear
political theory of change exists for how the operation will influence policy
outcomes. Examples include supporting policy reforms that would not happen
without the World Bank operation, or in other cases, influencing prioritization,
timing, or technical quality. Furthermore, the results framework design is at the core
of DPO design. The design of results frameworks requires intensive dialogue and
debate between World Bank teams and governments involving tradeoffs and
tensions between ambition and realism, additionality and country ownership, and
depth and breadth. The strongest policy actions are relevant, critical, additional, and
measurable. Programmatic series offer several advantages, including the ability to
induce or support long-term government commitment to reforms, which is
particularly important to ensure sustained implementation of policy reforms.
However, M&E systems for environmental DPOs were often weak. Objectives were
often imprecise or unclear, and indicators did not provide a direct or adequate
reflection of the objectives or their associated subobjectives. Results frameworks
sometimes measure processes instead of results or impact. The report offers advice
on selecting objectives and indicators, noting pitfalls to avoid. Finally, analytical
work and technical assistance are important to the success of environmental policy
lending operations. Analytical work has a key role as a diagnostic and in providing
the evidence base for persuading decision makers. However, sufficient analytic and
advisory work is not always present because of tightening budgets and declining
trust fund availability, timing and reliance on previous analytical work instead of
new work commissioned specifically for the operation, and the unwillingness of
many governments to borrow for technical assistance (IEG 2016i).

13.     IEG’s learning product on housing financing refers to recent UN-Habitat
estimates to assert that without significant action, the number of people living in
slums worldwide will rise to 900 million by 2020, and that level of access to
adequate housing will exacerbate problems associated with rapid urbanization and
population growth (IEG 2016s). Mortgage markets in many developing countries
remain weak and underfunded, with mortgage-to-gross domestic (GDP) product
ratios below 10 percent. World Bank Group investment in housing finance is small
compared with estimates of the value of the housing gap at ($9 trillion to $11
trillion). Given disparities in scale between its resources and the challenge, the
World Bank Group must act strategically and needs to engage in catalytic
interventions to make a real impact in the sector. The learning product highlights the
importance of establishing compensating factors, such as adequate sequencing,
timely interventions, and committed sponsors, particularly when preconditions for
developing capital market and primary market interventions in housing are not in



                                                                                    245

IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
place. A well-functioning housing finance sector typically evolves in three stages.
Countries often start by strengthening the enabling environment, then progress to
initiating the primary market before reaching a stage in which they can sustain
mortgage funding through tapping the capital markets. Getting the sequence right
can be crucial. For example, in Colombia, IFC and the World Bank helped the
government develop a new housing law that contained the regulatory framework
for asset securitization. IFC then supported the creation of a securitization company.
As much as timing and sequencing matter—particularly on the policy side—
conditions in the field might interfere. In such cases, committed sponsors who
support passing key reforms can be crucial. Gaining the commitment of key players
is also vital. For example, in Morocco, the government and World Bank succeeded in
sustaining a low-income housing program mainly because there was strong,
sustained commitment from key actors, particularly in government.

14.     IEG’s 2016 learning product on land administration projects highlights the
complexity and diversity of issues associated with land administration. A key lesson
is that because of this complexity, stand-alone operations are better for addressing
land administration challenges than a component of a multisector operation (IEG
2016j). The report also shows that there is no universal best practice for the most
effective institutional model for carrying out cadaster and registry functions. The
best model is one that matches a given historical and institutional development
context. Land reforms require medium to long-term support, which programmatic
instruments can facilitate, but they also require continuous monitoring of political
commitment. Projects perform best when structured to make incremental
improvements to the legal and policy framework. Interventions are more successful
when tailored to the existing implementation capacity and incorporating measures
to enhance the capacity as experience is gained, particularly regarding the
introduction of technological advances. Improvements to land tenure alone will not
always be sufficient to generate broader development outcomes. Reforms beyond
the land sector may also be required, and these can be challenging. Parallel projects
supporting reforms in other sectors are more manageable than a single operation
that tries to tackle both land and non-land reforms. Social inclusion needs to be an
explicit part of project design. Targeted strategies are required to reach vulnerable
groups and ensure that all segments of the population will benefit from a particular
land administration intervention, even when the laws and procedures are nominally
the same for all potential beneficiaries.

Project Performance Assessment Reports

Agriculture
15.    The Mozambique Market-Led Smallholder Development in the Zambezi
Valley Project, approved in 2006 and valued at $28 million, was designed to help
poor rural farmers in the Zambezi Valley increase their productivity and incomes
and connect to wider opportunities within the rural economy. The project was
located in some of Mozambique’s poorest districts in the poorest provinces. IEG’s
PPAR, based on 365 beneficiary interviews and 68 subproject validations, found that
the use of country systems (including financial management, procurement, and
monitoring systems) was premature and prone to mismanagement. This led to
overreliance on the country’s new decentralization framework, and the project
lacked robust and clear participation criteria. This, coupled with the need to
distribute capital-intensive infrastructure that required skills and access to labor and
land, resulted in elite capture of productive assets. Overall, agricultural productivity
increased, and farmers achieved additional crop diversity through the provision of
enhanced technical assistance and the distribution of improved inputs. But the
project did not tackle the underlying poverty drivers related to the composition and
nature of the agricultural input and marketing chains, which were unstructured,
asymmetric, and highly unfavorable for rural, small-scale farmers. The PPAR found
no evidence that the project supported sustained, increased marketing opportunities
for the smallholders.

16.     The Mozambique Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) 3, 4, and 5,
valued at $220 million and implemented between 2007 and 2009, aimed at achieving
better macroeconomic management and improved governance, and at removing
constraints to development by enhancing the business environment, improving
infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth. The program’s objectives aligned
well with the World Bank’s assistance and partnership strategies and were highly
relevant to the challenges facing Mozambique’s economy. However, the program
relied too much on public financial management reforms to achieve the broader
macroeconomic objective, excluding macroeconomic stability indicators. The
program’s design could have paid more attention at the design stage to the urban-
rural distribution of pro-poor expenditure from the national budget and the quality
of these expenditures. Macroeconomic performance improved during the
implementation of PRSCs 3–5, but other macroeconomic indicators deteriorated
after the series. For example, public debt increased to about 40 percent of GDP
between 2010 and 2013, and then to 57 and 74 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015,
respectively. Allocation of budget resources to priority sectors was close to the 65
percent target during and after the period of PRSCs 3–5, but there was no

information on the distribution of these funds to the provinces or districts where the
poor are located. Decentralization reforms to enhance public investments and
service delivery at the provincial and district levels were modestly achieved, but
substantial gains were made in the real sector through improving the business
environment, removing constraints to growth, and promoting agricultural growth.

17.     Gravely reminiscent of the 1984 famine, about 20 million people in Ethiopia
faced destitution and starvation in 2003 after the sixth poor rainy season in three
years. In the aftermath of this crisis, the World Bank helped to develop and fund a
program that would increase the resilience of Ethiopia’s 12 million livestock-
dependent pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities. The Pastoral Community
Development Program implemented during 2003–08 (Phase I) and 2008–13 (Phase II)
provided basic social services, productive activities, an early warning system, and
mechanisms for mobilizing group savings and lending. Overall, the assessment found
that project support for pastoral development should take place within the context of
a sound sector strategy that can offer well-researched, analytical advice about climatic
and environmental conditions, and the implications of shifting social, economic, and
demographic pressures and trends. Most of the project’s assistance focused on the
provision of social infrastructure and some limited economic infrastructure, and the
two projects assessed made a significant contribution to meeting critical social and
economic infrastructure needs. But a sustainable livelihood-centered approach would
have required a much broader range of coordinated investments, considering the
combination of investments package needed to elevate livelihoods
significantly. Given the constraints and challenges of pastoralist communities, a
sustainable livelihood approach would focus on the livestock value chain, rangeland
management, access to water and grazing land, and development of supplementary
income sources in the non-farm economy.

18.    In Brazil, IEG assessed the Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction Project (2001–09)
and the Santa Catarina Natural Resource Management and Rural Poverty Reduction
Project (2002–09) comparatively. The two projects are comparable examples of
community-driven development approaches to rural poverty reduction under
different conditions. Both projects sought to improve the rural poor’s incomes and
living conditions, though the Santa Catarina project had an integrated
environmental focus. But poverty conditions in the two states differed greatly—at
approval, Ceará had the second largest rural poverty rate in Brazil, and Santa
Catarina had the lowest rate. The Ceará project substantially improved the poor’s
access to water and electricity and, to some extent, productive capacity (mainly
tractors). The project made positive and significant impacts for employment and
income obtained through enhanced farm production, but gains in income, though
positive, were not statistically significant compared with a control group. Because

                                                             IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
IEG assessed profitability for only four of the 264 productive subprojects (masonry,
cashew nut marketing, hammock marketing, and irrigated agriculture), data were
not available to validate the income effects of a statistically representative sample of
productive investments, many of which were rural, non-farm activities. The Santa
Catarina project substantially helped integrate environmental and social
sustainability into the state’s development and poverty reduction strategies.
However, it only modestly helped enhance local governance and community
participation in decision making. The objective of reversing land degradation and
achieving better protection of natural resources was modestly achieved based on
data obtained on water quality and soil protection, and improvements to income-
generating opportunities and living conditions for the rural poor were substantial.

Energy
19.    IEG produced a PPAR for the Turkey Environmental Sustainability and
Energy Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL). Progress had stalled in the mid-
2000s on some aspects of Turkey’s market-oriented energy sector liberalization, and
Turkey faced the prospect of electricity shortages. The World Bank aimed to
alleviate these shortages with programmatic policy lending to support an increase in
the pace of reforms and encourage investment, approving the Programmatic
Electricity Sector DPL in 2009. During preparation, the government increased its
prioritization of environmental issues after the opening of the environmental
chapter of the EU acquisition and accession to the Kyoto Protocol, so the World
Bank expanded its energy program to include environmental issues, approving the
Second and Third Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector DPLs.1

20.    The program’s power sector aspects were strong, with a coherent design of
mutually reinforcing prior actions covering electricity sector market development,
pricing reform, renewable energy development, distribution company privatization,
energy efficiency, and others (though little was done to address issues in the gas
sector). A long history of engagement, substantial analytic work, and the World
Bank’s ability to act as an honest broker to government and private investors
supported the overall effort. The reforms were largely successful and supported
substantial private sector investment in generation and distribution capacity, which
prevented significant shortages. However, the program’s environmental aspects
were mixed. Environmental management’s main weaknesses were in capacity and
enforcement, not policy, so increasing some standards had little impact. Some

2009. The second operation was approved on June 15, 2010, and closed on December 31,
2010. The third operation was approved on March 27, 2012, and closed on June 30, 2013.


                                                                                     249

IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
environmental policy reforms were relatively minor, but the World Bank DPL
added modest value for others because government—motivated by EU
harmonization—was already pursuing the reforms. It was more difficult to use
policy lending to try to open an engagement on environmental issues without strong
existing relationships or parallel technical assistance.

Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience
21.     The Bangladesh Social Investment Program, implemented during 2003–12
and valued at $60 million, was designed to improve access to local infrastructure
and basic services through the provision of effective and efficient financing
mechanisms using a community-driven development approach. The project
operated in two of the country’s poorest districts with limited access to
infrastructure and basic services. However, a lack of poverty targeting at the
community level and adoption and adherence to clear rules of engagement
(including the use of social accountability tools) undermined the relevance of project
design. However, the relevance of design was enhanced at mid-term when measures
were taken to increase community participation—including women and youth—and
to direct services to the poor. The original results framework did not align with the
project objective. The objective of improving access to local infrastructure and basic
services was substantially met, although the distributional impacts are unclear. Like
other community-driven development programs that were operating when natural
disasters hit, the project had potential for flexibility and use as a tool for disaster
crisis response. With its extensive outreach, the program directed two additional
rounds of financing to remote areas affected by flooding and a cyclone. However,
the model was too rigid and the high level of additional finance available for the
response outstripped capacity and required coverage in areas where the program,
did not have a presence before the crisis.

Transport
22.     The PPAR for the Morocco Urban Transport Sector DPL—one of only two
World Bank–financed transport DPLs—highlighted the importance of conducting a
thorough analysis of the macroeconomic context and the necessary transport sector
reforms to define the priority interventions and set the DPL objective. The DPL’s
design benefited significantly from several years of high-value World Bank
analytical and advisory work. The PPAR found that the DPL’s prior actions were
critically needed to accelerate policy and institutional strengthening measures, raise
the profile of key issues, coalesce stakeholders, set timelines, and monitor results.
However, the additionality of the prior actions and the attribution of outcomes to
the World Bank’s intervention are not fully clear. The government had already
identified and initiated many of the prior actions before the DPL’s approval and


250
                                                                              APPENDIX J
                                                            IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
implementation, which leads to the counterfactual question of whether the reforms
would have proceeded without the DPL. Furthermore, the choice to use the DPL
instrument alone, without accompanying and much-needed investment project
financing or technical assistance, detracted from the full achievement of several
physical infrastructure outcomes. Consequently, sector governance and
environmental sustainability improved, but increased supply and performance of
urban transport services and infrastructure were only modestly achieved.

23.       The PPAR highlighted the following useful lessons:

         Broad and early participation from implementing agencies and local
          governments and strong government reform momentum already need to be
          in place at entry for DPLs to achieve results.
         Flexible and adaptive responses by the government are required to continue
          pursuing the DPL’s objectives when specific actions do not achieve expected
          results.
         The World Bank’s convening authority and intellectual leadership need to
          support the government’s work on consensus building and interagency
          coordination, especially at the initial stages of DPLs.
         The World Bank has an important role in ensuring that all investment options
          are analyzed to select the least-cost options.
         Sector DPLs could be more effective if accompanied by parallel investment
          lending and technical assistance, or if they are designed as a programmatic
          series that would expand the implementation time frame to several years.

24.    IEG prepared a PPAR for the Senegal Urban Mobility Improvement Project to
understand the factors behind the unsatisfactory outcomes of the World Bank’s first
project in Senegal, which had the objective of improving the safety, efficiency, and
quality (operational and environmental) of urban mobility in Greater Dakar. Given
the growing crisis in urban mobility in Dakar, the project’s objective was
substantially relevant to the World Bank’s country strategies and the government’s
own transport sector policies. However, the project design, though modest in some
respects, was complex and overambitious. The design tackled the road and railway
subsectors and assigned project implementation to an agency created just before
appraisal. The agency did not have the adequate mandate and resources to fulfill its
designated regulatory and organizing authority functions. The project’s innovative
minibus leasing pilot program (which replaced old minibuses with more efficient
and environmentally clean vehicles) had substantial outcomes. Road safety outputs
were achieved, but the outcomes were modest given the lack of road maintenance,
rapid growth in vehicular traffic, and continued use by overloaded trucks, all of
which negated many of the project’s benefits. Railway upgrading outcomes were not

achieved—suburban railway operations were worse when the project closed—and
environmental outcomes were only partially achieved.

25.       The project yielded the following useful lessons:

         Innovative leasing mechanisms can be effective in replacing aging public
          transport fleets, but their success depends on operator inputs at the design
          stage, technical assistance to professionalize operators and drivers, and
          restructuring the network of informal transport operators.
         Establishing an effective lead agency for urban transport planning and
          management requires strong and sustained support from the government
          and stakeholders.
         Land use and transport planning need to be coordinated at the metropolitan
          scale, and spatial analysis needs to be mainstreamed into urban transport
          project design.
         Adequate road maintenance is a key factor in achieving sustainable
          outcomes.
         Rigorous M&E is crucial for setting priorities for policy and regulatory
          actions.

26.     IEG assessed urban transport projects in Lagos, Nigeria, and Mumbai, India,
as an input into the ongoing evaluation of the World Bank Group’s support for
urban transport development. Lagos is the largest city in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
Lagos metropolitan area suffers from unreliable public transportation and chronic
traffic congestion. Consequently, the World Bank supported the Lagos Urban
Transport Project to improve transportation services for public transportation users,
especially the poor, through five subobjectives: improvement in the metropolitan
transport sector management, road network enhancement, more efficient public
transportation services, promotion of water transportation, and preparation for
future phases of the urban transport program.

27.       The IEG assessment of urban transport projects drew the following lessons:

         Establishing a strong, single authority (the Lagos Metropolitan Transport
          Authority) enabled a coordinated approach to planning and regulation.
         The World Bank continued to support the initiative with continuous
          engagement through a follow-on project, which was crucial because urban
          transport reforms require long periods of intervention and support.
         The initiatives were underpinned by the creation of a Transport Fund, which
          contributed to greater sustainability.

        an opportunity arose to support the design of a bus rapid transit system (this

        to observe similar successful systems in other developing countries.

28.     Mumbai is one of the world’s top 10 centers for commerce measured by
financial flows. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region has a population of more than 20
million, and the rail backbone of the transportation system carries more than 7
million passengers daily. The objectives of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project
were to facilitate urban economic growth and improve the quality of life by fostering
the development of an efficient and sustainable transportation system, including
effective institutions to meet users’ needs. To improve public transportation, it was
necessary to relocate more than 100,000 people, many of whom lived in squatter
settlements by the rail tracks. This was the World Bank’s largest urban resettlement
project.

29.    IEG’s assessment of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project highlighted the
following lessons:

       Project development objectives needed to be more specific and measurable.
       Large-scale resettlement is a complex operation that needs considerable
        planning, adequate time, good negotiation skills, and strong capacity to
        implement successfully.
       Not adequately synchronizing resettlement activities with civil works can
        lead to significant time and cost overruns.
       Transition from an administrative compensation approach to a win-win
        negotiated approach can resolve even the most seemingly intractable disputes
        between affected parties.
       Introducing entitlements and market-based solutions were major contributors
        to resettlement success.

30.    IEG assessed two water projects in Ghana. The objectives of the Second Urban
Environmental Sanitation Project were to improve urban living conditions in Accra,
Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tamale, and Tema sustainably pertaining to
environmental health, sanitation, drainage, vehicular access, and solid waste
management, with special emphasis on the poor. Unsanitary landfills were closed or
improved, and staff was trained to operate new equipment. Environmental
conditions improved through closure of unsafe or unsanitary dumps and the
opening of new landfills. Scavengers from the old waste dumps were organized into

associations and trained to maintain basic safety standards, such as using protective
gear. The project’s investments in solid waste management, sanitation, and training
the environmental health units’ public health and environmental health staff are
likely to contribute to environmental health outcomes for reduced diarrheal diseases
and vector-borne diseases. However, the extent of the improvement in
environmental health is unknown because the project did not include an indicator to
track this outcome.

31.      The objective of the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project was to
increase access to a sustainable water supply and sanitation services in small towns
in six regions in Ghana. The project increased access to sustainable water supply
facilities, which represented about 85 percent of the investments and about 90
percent of beneficiaries. Access to sanitation increased, but not sustainably because
the water supply sector has stronger institutional support than the sanitation sector.

32.       IEG’s PPAR for the project drew the following lessons:

         To use school toilets sustainably, an integrated hygiene education program
          needs to be offered on a continuous basis. Sustained provision of hygiene
          education (availability of information, and soap and water near toilets)
          ensures that incoming classes continue to learn and use safe hygiene
          practices.
         Stakeholder analysis and citizen engagement during project and facility
          design is important for assessing the willingness to pay for the services.
         Changing the rules of the game for short-term political gains during
          implementation disrupts community involvement and sends the wrong
          signal to communities about government intentions. In the Small Towns
          Water and Sanitation Project, the decision to exempt communities from the 5
          percent copayment requirement alienated communities that paid it, and may
          increase resistance to paying other obligations if they anticipate more changes
          in government policy.

33.    IEG prepared a cluster PPAR in Peru for the Lima Water Rehabilitation and
Management Project and the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project.
The objective of the Lima Water Rehabilitation and Management Project was to
improve the efficiency of water and sanitation delivery in the Lima-Callao
metropolitan area. The project sought to promote water conservation, support the
privatization of the Lima water utility, SEDAPAL, rehabilitate damaged water
supply and sewerage systems, expand services to the urban poor in low-income
neighborhoods, and support reforms in the water and sanitation sectors’ legal and
institutional framework. The PPAR found that the momentum of privatizing

                                                             IEG NOTE ON GLOBAL PRACTICES
SEDAPAL was diminished by the existence of a back-up plan to strengthen its
capacity if the privatization did not go through. The objective of the National Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project was to increase the sustainable use of water
supply and sanitation facilities in rural areas and small towns while emphasizing
improvement in hygiene practices and training in operations and maintenance.
Despite restructuring at project appraisal, there was no clear policy and institutional
context to benchmark the country’s priorities and strategies for rural water and
sanitation services. Toward the end of the project, the government rolled back the
principle of cost recovery in providing infrastructure, which was out of line with a
basic premise of the project.

34.       Lessons from IEG’s assessment include the following:

         A strong focus on project outcomes and adequate accountability mechanisms
          are key factors in achieving significant improvements in service provision.
          Project design needs to address the gaps and weaknesses in sector institutions
          and governance identified during project preparation, because not doing so
          increases the risk to achieving project outcomes and prompt implementation.
         Efforts to replicate successful experiences from other contexts must carefully
          consider the receptivity of the implementing institutions and beneficiaries.
          The modalities of cost sharing and community participation need to be
          adapted to the local context, and supplementary resources made available as
          needed.
         Conserving water resources through demand and supply management can
          yield quick benefits to liberate water resources for new clients.
         Community participation in planning and operations underpins
          sustainability, but adequate training support, financial incentives, and
          contractual arrangements are necessary for continued and effective
          participation. Behavioral change for improved water and sanitation-related
          hygiene requires ongoing engagement with the community and collaboration
          with health and education sectors.

35.    Finally, with specific reference to Climate Change, one of the two cross-
cutting solution areas of relevance under this cluster, IEG evaluated the Indonesia
Climate Change DPL. Indonesia is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in
the developing world after China and India, but until recently, the World Bank had
avoided involvement in climate change policy lending to Indonesia established by
other donors because it did not see the opportunity for ambitious reforms. However,
the World Bank joined the ongoing program of support by approving the Indonesia
Climate Change DPL in 2010, after the government showed a willingness to make
reforms on energy pricing and forest governance to support its pledge to cut

emissions substantially. The operation was planned to be the first in a series of four
operations covering policy actions on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and
disaster preparedness, along with cross-sectoral and institutional issues. However,
the series did not proceed past the first operation because of several factors,
including the loss of critical reform champions, availability of budget support from
other financing sources, availability of other climate finance through the UN’s
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Program, and
noncompletion of some policy actions. Although performance in some policy
subareas was generally positive (such as those related to renewable energy, water
resource management, and natural disaster risk management), it was less true in
other subareas, especially those concerned with peatland conservation, the UN
program, and forest governance. Political economy barriers were substantial. For
example, local governments did not implement central government decisions when
those decisions challenged local economic and political interests (peatland use, palm
oil concessions, and curbing fires and deforestation), and the public showed strong
resistance to cutting energy subsidies. Although the DPL was somewhat
unsuccessful in achieving its objectives, it had a positive and strategically important
role as part of an evolving long-term policy dialogue with the World Bank on
climate change issues.
