      1. Introduction
The ‘Jobs M&E Toolkit’ provides a package of resources for project teams and clients to support
mainstreaming the jobs agenda in World Bank Group (WBG) lending operations (see Box 1). The aim is to
help teams working with government counterparts with simple tools for data collection on jobs, without
the burden of resource-intensive survey efforts. The toolkit contains a set of guidance on indicators for key
results on jobs, data collection forms and manuals, which are tailored by beneficiary type: individuals and
                                              firms (see Box 2).

                                              The resources made available through the Jobs M&E Toolkit
                                              have been developed by the WBG’s Jobs Group in a
consultative process. The menu of indicators and related guidance were generated through a portfolio
review of WBG projects and in consultation with Task Team Leaders (TTLs) from different Global Practices
(GPs). Further, data collection manuals were developed using existing resources from Labor Force Surveys,
enterprise surveys and different surveys developed by the WBG. Moreover, the Jobs M&E Toolkit is
currently being piloted in a number of WBG operations, with feedback from project teams helping to revise,
adapt and refine the Toolkit.

    2. Available Resources
The Jobs M&E Toolkit is a package that includes the following resources:

    A. Jobs Indicator Definition and Guidance includes definitions, unit of measure and guidance on
       baseline for each Jobs Indicator; guidance on the types of projects in which each Jobs Indicator
       may be used; and examples of World Bank projects where the Jobs Indicators (or those similar in
       nature) are used – by beneficiary type: Individuals (A.1.) and Firms (A.2.). Annex 1 – Definitions for
       Jobs Outcomes provides an overview of Job Outcomes commonly expected in WB projects at the
       Project Development Objective (PDO) level. Annex 2 – Definitions for Jobs Indicators includes a
       short definition for each Job Indicator. Documents A.1. (Individuals) and A.2. (Firms) include more
       detailed descriptions. Annex 3 - Definition and Guidance on Corporate Results Indicator on Jobs
       introduces the indicator “Number of project beneficiaries reached by jobs-focused WBG
       interventions” that will be reported in the WBG Corporate Scorecard.
    B. Jobs Data Collection Forms are short administrative forms for reporting on Jobs Indicators. Each
       form provides a comprehensive set of questions linked to a Job Indicator or for background
       information as a ‘menu’ from which WB task team leaders (TTLs) and teams may select. The
       questions used by WB teams will vary based on Job Indicators used in Project Results Frameworks.
       Data collection and reporting is usually under the responsibility of the PIU. Reporting frequency
       will ideally align with semi-annual supervision reporting or annually, as determined by WB teams.
       The forms are tailored by beneficiary type – Individuals (B.1.) and Firms (B.2.) – and the data to be
       collected will vary based on the Jobs Indicators that teams have selected in a particular project.
       Each Data Collection Form also has a Data Processing and Aggregation Table (Annex 4 – Individuals;
       Annex 5 – Firms) for PIU staff, such as M&E specialists, who will be responsible for data entry in
       Management Information Systems (MIS) and reporting on Jobs Indicators. The tables provide
       assistance on calculating the value of the selected Jobs Indicators based on the data collected.
       Annex 6 – Web-based Jobs Data Collection Forms provides links to the Jobs Group’s Survey Monkey
       platform where online versions of the Jobs Data Collection Forms are available. The web-based
       versions may be used by PIUs for self-administered data collection among beneficiaries or adapted
       for use by field teams collecting data with the online form.
    C. Jobs Data Collection Manuals for enumerators include brief Guidance on the use of the data
       collection forms when administering in the field among project beneficiaries – by beneficiary type:
       Individuals (C.1.) and Firms (C.2.).
    D. Template of Terms of References for the recruitment of a consultant / firm to implement the Jobs
       Data Collection Forms, which may be adapted by TTLs and the PIU for a given project and country.

The Jobs M&E Toolkit provides a ‘menu’ of jobs indicators for project teams to select from according to the
design of a specific intervention and expected results related to jobs. The Jobs M&E Toolkit includes
indicators at the PDO- and intermediate levels to

from WBG projects in different sectors and types of                            interventions at the firm-level also aim at
operations.                                                                    fostering small scale entrepreneurship, and

2 Firm beneficiaries refer to the entity directly participating in the project intervention. The term “firm” in this toolkit re fers to the
establishment. This is because an establishment may be part of a larger firm, but data collected under the projects must correspond
to the specific establishment receiving support/targeted by the intervention. If a project seeks data at the establishment level or
many establishments of the same firm, then data must be aggregated for reporting on indicators. Ideally, project results reporting
should be consistent with the Enterprise Survey (ES) methodology. The ES defines ‘firms’ as business organizations composed o f
one or more establishments that are specified under common ownership or control; and ‘establishments’ as the physical location
where business is conducted or where services or operations are performed. TTLs may need to adapt the terminology most relevant
for the country, legal, and beneficiary specific context of the project. Further guidance for the PIU and data collection firm is
provided in the Jobs M&E Toolkit: Data Collection Manual for Firm Beneficiaries.

The data collection methodology depends on availability of data sources, access to online tools by project
beneficiaries and the country context. For the Jobs M&E Toolkit, data may either be collected in field visits
by enumerators or self-reported by project beneficiaries through an online survey.4 The choice of the
appropriate methodology depends on the data to be collected and whether project beneficiaries have
access and are responsive to online surveys. Further, data collection in countries affected by fragility,
conflict, and violence (FCV) often faces particular challenges and may require different approaches (see
Box 3).

                             HOW CAN WE DESIGN JOBS M&E IN FCV COUNTRIES?


    In countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV), project-level M&E faces particular challenges.
    Teams may find the following considerations useful:
    Looking broadly for baseline data. Where the WBG and government possess limited data, it is worth reaching out
    to locally active NGOs, donors and universities. They might have data that can inform the selection of indicators
    and the setting of baseline and target values.
    Tracking disaggregated outcomes. Project teams may further want to disaggregate data to track outcomes for
    groups whose jobs prospects matter for stability. However, a thorough assessment is needed to understand
    whether collecting this information is culturally and contextually appropriate.
    Striking the right level of ambition in choosing indicators. Very detailed data collection forms can be hard to take
    to the field in FCV settings. There is a premium on selecting indicators that capture the essential characteristics
    of jobs, but are tractable.
    Remote and higher-frequency data collection. Security concerns can make traditional data collection infeasible or
    too costly. Information and communication technology (ICT) tools, such as SMS and phone surveys may provide
    an alternative. They can also facilitate more frequent monitoring and help keep track of results in a volatile
    environment.
    Institutional capacity. In FCV, the M&E capacity of government agencies can be rudimentary. It is worth
    considering opportunities to build capacity beyond the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), so protocols and data
    collected through the project can continue to bear fruit.

    4. Job Outcomes
Key outcomes on jobs are grouped under Job Creation, Job Quality, and Job Access. Outcomes and related
indicators may be included as results at the PDO-level, or as intermediate results,7 depending on project
design and objectives. Figure 1 below illustrates these three dimensions of Jobs Outcomes, and includes
brief descriptions of sub-outcomes that tend to be most relevant at the PDO level in WBG projects. Detailed
definitions are included in Annex 1.

Figure 1: Key Outcomes related to Jobs




Job Creation: Outcomes relate to the creation of more jobs for project target beneficiaries at an individual
level or within firms. Jobs may be created by private sector firms, either by new firm entry, or by growth
and expansion of existing firms leading to an increase in hired labor. While these jobs often cover wage
employment, another outcome refers to an increase in the number of entrepreneurs8 and self-employed.



7 Select intermediate outcomes that are relevant to jobs support labor supply and demand as facilitating factors towards achieving
these higher level results. Enhanced physical or commercial access to markets for goods and services and private sector
performance and competitiveness are key drivers behind job creation among firms – formal and informal. In addition, by developing
a country’s stock of human capital, or skills among the labor force for employment, interventions in education, for instance, can
increase employability, productivity and entrepreneurship, and access to jobs. These indicators tend to be most frequently cited
in WB projects that have a Jobs theme.
8Entrepreneurs are those persons and firms that seek to generate value through the creation or expansion of economic activity
by identifying and exploiting new products, processes, or markets (OECD 2008). In the jobs context, entrepreneurs /
entrepreneurship refer to existing and new firms.

Job Quality: Outcomes focus on the ability of beneficiaries to achieve better labor market results, through
(a) enhanced productivity levels, (b) improved working conditions, and (c) higher earnings. Many of the
poor already have jobs, but these may be poor quality jobs in low productivity, low income activities. These
types of results are therefore especially relevant for projects targeting the informal sector, and livelihoods
projects.

Job Access: Outcomes relate to (i) connecting people to jobs from inactivity or unemployment; (ii) helping
people move from one job to another; and (iii) improving performance of the labor market. Asking the
question “Jobs for whom?” allows targeting of specific vulnerable or traditionally disadvantaged groups in
the labor market, especially women, youth, and the bottom 40 percent of households. Targeting can also
be spatial – for example creating jobs in a rural, lagging region, or in fragile or vulnerable settings.

 Definition                     This Corporate Results Indicator tracks the number of project beneficiaries reached by interventions
                                that contribute to the jobs agenda; i.e. interventions with an explicitly stated and substantive link to
                                creating more, better, and/or inclusive jobs. In this context, “jobs” is defined as an activity that
                                generates income, monetary or in kind, without violating human rights.
                                The indicator should be selected if the project also reports to one of the following Corporate Results
                                Indicators:
                                -   Farmers reached with agricultural assets and services

Annex 6. Web-based Jobs Data Collection Forms

The Jobs M&E Toolkit includes two sets of data collection forms for World Bank project teams:

   I.    Data collection to be administered by a consultant / firm hired to gather data among project
         beneficiaries with a field team of enumerators;
  II.    Data collection that is self-administered among project beneficiaries using an online platform, such
         as Survey Monkey.


Jobs data collection that is administered

The two data collection forms – Individuals (B.1.) and Firms (B.2.) – included in the Jobs M&E Toolkit in
Excel format are designed for use by a consultant / firm for primary data gathering in the field. The format
is designed to be simple for recording entries, and with clear guidance as part of field team training. It is at
TTLs’ discretion their preference to use the Excel format with the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) or third
party responsible for data collection. The factors may include insufficient connectivity or other logistical
factors that constrain the use of a web-based approach. When planning to use hard-copy forms, project
teams will need to consider the data entry, error checks, and data cleaning protocols to ensure accurate
project results reporting. The Jobs M&E Toolkit: Data Collection Manuals – Individuals (C.1.) and Firms (C.2.)
– provide additional guidance.

Jobs data collection that is self-administered

TTLs with projects that are able to accommodate web-based data collection for results reporting may use
the following draft data collection forms hosted on the Jobs Group’s Survey Monkey page:

Firms:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=XyF0mTJmHVB_2BJvsqVotJq97KXXNMYwzfaBYqSlZ5np9O

B_2Fm0rknZ9V76hTfPXi2CuKv0

Projects that have large numbers of direct beneficiaries, are geographically diverse, face logistical
challenges / high transport costs, and/or prefer to minimize data entry efforts may prefer using the online
forms. These jobs-focused data collection forms may be adapted based on project / country / legal context,
and may be added to for other results reporting part of the results framework.

The Jobs Group M&E Team is available as a resource for questions on accessing, adapting, pilot testing, and
implementing these new online data collection forms focused on jobs.

Additional notes                    -     Universal coverage: in a country with universal coverage for any of the social insurances,
                                          the indicator should not track coverage for that particular social insurance, as it would
                                          not be indicative of job quality. Therefore, this indicator should only be used for social
                                          insurances the employer and/or employees have to contribute to in order to have

Additional notes            -   Self-reporting of earnings: in some settings, data collection on earnings may be a
                                challenge, especially when collected by government agencies (perceived as breach of
                                privacy; over- or underreporting for tax reasons etc.). Instead of asking for the earnings,
                                it may be easier to propose different earning bands to the beneficiaries who then will
                                choose among the different options.
                            -   Real term changes in earnings: in countries with high inflation and / or long project
                                duration, teams may want to calculate earnings in real terms. In this case, the data
                                collected over the project period needs to be adjusted for inflation (year of baseline
                                data collection would be the base year).

Definition                              The indicator tracks the increase in the number of net FTE jobs in beneficiary firms since
                                        the onset of the project.
                                        Full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs: FTE jobs may follow local definitions. If not
                                        clear/unavailable, use:
                                        -    7 or more hours a day (or 35 hours a week)
                                        -    48 weeks in a year
                                        Part-time jobs are converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on
                                        local definition (e.g., if working week equals 35 hours, a 20 hour/week job would be equal
                                        to 0.6 FTE job).
                                        Seasonal or short-term jobs are prorated on the basis of the portion of the reporting
                                        period that was worked (e.g., a full-time position for three months would be equal to a
                                        0.25 FTE job if the reporting period is one year).
                                        If the information is not available, the rule-of-thumb is two part-time jobs equal a full-
                                        time job.
                                        Beneficiary firm: all establishments of a firm directly participating in the corresponding
                                        project component
                                        Note: While tracking FTE jobs sheds light on the estimated number of labor days created
                                        by a project’s intervention, it fails to measure the quality of those jobs or whom benefits,
                                        such as targeted vulnerable groups. Tracking related measures of productivity, earnings
                                        among workers, and who benefits from jobs in beneficiary firms is advised.

    Note: Additional questions as background information or linked to related Jobs Indicators are included in this form. For instance, Section 2 on Establishment Characteristics provides questions on sectors in which establishments operate
    for disaggregating employment status by sector. Section 3 on Workforce includes additional questions for disaggregating employees by gender and age (youth). Additional examples include Q3.13-3.16 that will allow for
    disaggregation of jobs in terms of new jobs (high- and low-skilled jobs) created during the period of project support. Q4.07 is another optional question that sheds light on book-keeping practices as indicative of data quality, including
    financial information reported by the establishment.

1. Introduction

    1.1. Objectives of the Survey

[TO BE ADAPTED BY THE PROJECT TEAM: BACKGROUND AND GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION: NAME OF THE
PROJECT, OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND TIMEFRAME]


    1.2. Field Staff

Interview sites are allocated on a schedule and assigned to various field teams so as to balance workload and travel
time across each team. Overall, there will be [XX] teams working throughout the [COUNTRY OR INTERVENTION
AREAS]. Each team has been assigned sites in one particular area in the country. All members of a team will work
together in one site each [TIME UNIT]. Every interviewer will be allocated the same workload per site. Each team
consists of a supervisor, [NN] interviewers. [IF APPLICABLE ADD: A DATA ENTRY OPERATOR].


    1.3. Field Team Composition and its Place in the Survey Structure

While the data collection teams are deployed in the field, they are part of a bigger structure: the structure is composed
by the management team and the field teams. The management team is led by the Survey Manager, who has the
overall responsibility of the study. Two collaborators are assisting the Survey Manager: The Field-Operations Manager
and the Data Manager.

The Field Operations Manager coordinates the activities of the field teams and ensures that the field teams are
equipped with all necessary resources to carry out high-quality data collection in a timely manner. The Data Manager
builds up the database. This happens through the close inspection and continuous monitoring of the in-progress
database, which is based on the field teams’ work. In this sense, both arms of the survey (field operations and data
management) are equally important for the work in the field.


                                                                Survey
                                                               Manager




                                             Field Ops
                                                                            Data Manager
                                             Manager



                                                                                Data Entry and
                               Field Teams               Field Teams            Management
                                                                                    Team

Composition of a field team:

The supervisor is the main link between the management team and the interviewers. S/he will oversee, coordinate,
monitor, and -when necessary- correct the work of the interviewers.




Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                 61
The interviewers will be responsible for collecting the data from selected beneficiaries in each site, helping in better
understanding the local customs and dialects, as well as administering the data collection form.

[IF DATA ENTRY IN THE FIELD] The data entry operator will be responsible for capturing all paper-based data in
electronic format. As the data entry program will flag internal data inconsistencies and errors, the data entry operator
will have to report them to the supervisor for correction.


      1.4. Survey Plan

The [NN] teams will interview the [XXXX] selected beneficiaries over the course of a [WW-WEEKS] period. As
mentioned earlier, each team will visit 1 site per [TIME-UNIT]. During this period, each interviewer will interview
[XXXX] beneficiaries, thus covering [YYY] beneficiaries each [TIME-PERIOD].


      1.5. Field Team Roles

         1.5.1. The Role of the Supervisor
The supervisor is the main link between the teams and the Survey office in [CENTRAL LOCATION], and s/he represents
the management team in the field. The supervisor has the following main tasks:

  ▪    The supervisor will provide the field staff with blank data collection forms and other materials (pencil,
       notebooks etc.), and will daily accompany the field team to the interviewing site.
  ▪    [ONLY IN THE CASE OF USING A SAMPLING STRATEGY] In the event that a replacement of a selected beneficiary
       is necessary, the supervisor will assign the new beneficiary to the interviewer and will record this operation.
  ▪    The supervisor will examine all the data collection forms completed by the field staff. S/he will verify that the
       data collection forms are complete and properly filled-in. In cases where further work or corrections are
       needed, the supervisor will accordingly instruct the interviewer.
  ▪    The supervisor will, on a regular basis, observe interviews carried out by the interviewers to evaluate their
       work. S/he will help the interviewers maintain good professional practice over time by providing them with an
       objective viewpoint on their performance with regards to respect of standard interview practice. Observing
       interviews in the field regularly will also help keep the supervisor aware of any problems faced by the
       interviewers.
  ▪    The supervisor will keep the management team informed of the performance of the interviewers in the field.
       S/he will make regular evaluation reports that will cover their behaviour and appearance during interviews, the
       quality of the interviews, and their working relationship with the supervisor and other team members. At the
       end of each [TIME UNIT], s/he will send an evaluation report to the management team. It is recommended that
       this report is sent weekly in the first weeks of fieldwork, when the teams are more in need of all possible
       support. Later, this report can be produced bi-weekly or monthly.
  ▪    The supervisor will help the interviewers to solve any problems they encounter during the course of their work
       in a manner that is consistent with the rules and procedures set for field work by the management team. The
       supervisor of each team will hold regular meetings with all team members [IF ONLY INTERVIEWERS, PLACE
       INTERVIEWERS, IF INCLUDING A DATA ENTRY OPERATOR, WRITE “BOTH, INTERVIEWERS AND DATA ENTRY
       OPERATOR] about how their work is going. The interviewers [AND DATA ENTRY OPERATOR] must keep their
       supervisor immediately informed of any difficulties or problems that they encounter.
  ▪    [IF DATA ENTRY IN THE FIELD:] The supervisor will be the referee for determining who is responsible for
       correcting an encountered error or inconsistency. The supervisor will determine whether the inconsistency or
       error is present on the paper-based form (interviewer error) or if this error is a data-entry typo (entry-error).



Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                62
      When an interviewer-error is detected, the interviewer will be prompted to correct it (if needed, by re-
      interviewing the respondent) and only then the data will be entered by the data entry operator. If it is a data-
      entry error, the supervisor will instruct the data-entry operator to fix the problem.
  ▪   [IN CASE OF PAPER-BASED INTERVIEWS:] The supervisor will create the Site folder, which contains all data
      collection forms, both complete and incomplete, ordered by interviewer including the following information:
      (a) Total number of forms; (b) Total of complete forms; (c) Total of incomplete forms; (d) Number of forms with
      male beneficiaries; (e) Number of forms with female beneficiaries; (f) Number of forms by interviewer.

What happens when one interviewer produces too many mistakes? The supervisor will assist the interviewer to
improve his/her work. For instance, the interviewer will need a refreshment on the most frequent errors; the
supervisor will probably have to accompany the interviewer for a few interviews and directly supervise his/her job. In
any case, the supervisor must include any problems encountered in the reports to the management team so that they
may assist the supervisor to take appropriate actions.

What happens when the data entry operator is producing too many mistakes? The data entry operator will receive an
immediate feedback while entering the collected data. The supervisor will assist the data entry operator to improve
his/her performance. In any case, the supervisor must include any problems encountered in the reports to the
management team so that they may assist the supervisor to take appropriate actions.


         1.5.2. The Role of the Interviewer
The interviewers are the foundation of the quality and usefulness of the collected data. The success of the entire data
collection process ultimately depends upon the care the interviewers take in collecting and recording the information.
The information they collect will be used to track the achievements of the [NAME OF PROJECT] and inform decision-
making in the management of the project. Incomplete or inaccurate data may lead to wrong decisions. For this reason,
it is imperative that the interviewers must work carefully and systematically to obtain accurate and complete
information from the respondents. It is very important for the interviewers to pay close attention during each
interview, watching and listening carefully to detect any problems that may occur so that they can discuss them with
their supervisor. The interviewer must also check the integrity of the collected data: in each data collection form, s/he
has to make sure that all required information is present.

It is important that the interviewers keep in mind three general rules during the interview:

  ▪   Read the questions exactly as they appear in the data collection form. The interviewers should not shorten or
      change the wording of the questions, and should avoid interpreting a question for the respondent unless s/he
      is unable to understand the question as stated. If interpretation is needed, this should happen in a neutral way,
      without suggesting an answer.
  ▪   Information about a particular individual should be reported by that person only. Interviewers should discourage
      other training-mates or beneficiary colleagues from answering on the behalf of others. In other words, keeping
      the interview private will ensure both the confidentiality and the quality of the collected data.
  ▪   Ensure confidentiality. All information collected is confidential, and must not be divulged. If the respondent
      knows this, they are more likely to give fruitful answers. As far as possible, the interviewer should try to
      interview all respondents privately.

To carry out the interview, the interviewers will need the following materials: (a) Data collection manual; (b) Data
collection forms (one per interviewee); (c) Writing pad; (d) Identification Card; (e) Lead Pencils; (f) Eraser; (g) [IF
NEEDED:] Laptop or Tablet. The material will be provided to the interviewers by the supervisor. It is the responsibility
of the interviewers to make sure that they have the material with them at all times during the field work.




Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                 63
         1.5.3. The Role of the Data Entry Operator
The main role of the Data Entry Operator is to capture in an electronic format all the information present in the data
collection forms completed by the interviewers. This job has to be performed on a daily basis. The Data Entry Operator
is joining the team during the field work, as data entry is an integral part of the data quality-chain.

The Data Entry Operator has to enter the data as it is on the complete form. No editing or changing data is allowed.
The Data Entry Program will issue warning messages when an error or an inconsistency is found as the Data Entry
Operator captures the data. The Data Entry Operator is not allowed to modify the data; data must be recorded as
stated in the data collection forms.

Some questions may have left blank by the interviewer in the data collection form. This may be the case for three
reasons:

  ▪   It is a skipped question, in which case, no data is expected;
  ▪   No information was provided by the respondent;
  ▪   The interviewer made a mistake and the data collection form is not complete.

If data is missing because it is a skipped question, then data entry in the system will not be a problem. However, if the
data entry program does not skip the question and the Data Entry Operator is prompted to enter data, it means,
either:

  ▪   The Data Entry Operator has entered a wrong code in a previous question; meaning the program is expecting
      data. In this case, the Data Entry Operator needs to check the previous questions and check the codes entered;
  ▪   If no information was provided by the respondent, the Data Entry Operator should expect to see a comment
      from the interviewer explaining why. The Data Entry Operator has to inform the supervisor, for him/her to
      decide on how to proceed.
  ▪   If the interviewer made a mistake, i.e. it is not a skipped question, the prior codes are correct, but the
      interviewer did not record any information; the Data Entry Operator must leave the question blank, as it is on
      the data collection form. The Data Entry Operator has to inform the supervisor, for him/her to decide on how
      to proceed.

Another important source of errors is when no data is expected for a question, but the question does have data. This
may be the case when the interviewer did not respect the skip instructions. The Data Entry Operator must
nevertheless enter the data, as recorded in the data collection form. In this case, the Data Entry Operator will receive
a message that “Information in question XX has been found, yet this is a skipped question”. In this case, capturing the
data is important, so that the supervisor may follow up with the interviewer and ensure a high quality of the data
collection.

Once the Data Entry Operator has entered all the data of the data collection form, the program will issue a report
detailing the entered cases and the errors or inconsistencies found. If errors or inconsistencies were found, the
supervisor has to be informed immediately to check whether the encountered errors or inconsistencies are related
to the data entry (a typo), or whether they are present in the data collection form.

If the errors or inconsistencies are related to the data entry, they must be corrected. If they are present in the data
collection form, the supervisor will instruct the interviewer to correct the mistake(s). Only once the interviewer has
corrected the errors, or provided a comment explaining why the inconsistency is the actual fact, or the respondent
does not have the information, data entry may be completed.

It is important that the Data Entry Operator does never guess what the information might be. Also, the Data Entry
Operator must never correct any information present in the data collection form.

      1.6. Interacting with the Local Project Staff and Respondents

Arrival at the site. By the time the interviewers arrive at the new site for the first time, the supervisor will already have
contacted the local person responsible for [PROJECT] and officials to explain the purpose of the data collection. When
the interviewers arrive, the supervisor will introduce them to these key individuals.

When contacting the respondents. On arrival at a new site, after having been introduced to officials, the interviewers
must contact the respondents who are to participate in the study, according to a planning predefined by the
supervisor and communicated to the interviewers. The supervisor will accompany the interviewers for the
introductory part of the interview. The interviewer will introduce him/herself, explain the purpose of the interview,
the confidentiality of the data gathered, and confirm that the respondent is willing to be interviewed.

In order to obtain or maintain trust and cooperation, the interviewer should explain to or remind the respondents
that the confidentiality of the information collected will be maintained at all times, that their identity will not be
divulged to others, that data will never be used for taxation or other purposes, and will only be presented in aggregate
forms, thus no individual can be identified.

Any difficulties that the interviewers may experience during the preparation of the interview should be brought to
the immediate attention of their supervisor who will take necessary action.



2. The Interview
Listed below are some general rules for interviewers to follow when they conduct the interviews:

  ▪    Maintain good conduct. Interviewers should always be courteous toward everyone. They should treat other
       team members and all respondents and their communities with respect. The interviewers’ behaviour can have
       an enormous influence on the opinions of the people in areas where they work, and whether respondents view
       data collection as worthwhile depends heavily on it.
       Interviewers should always behave in culturally appropriate ways. They should avoid behaviour that people
       find disturbing or upsetting. They should always be properly dressed. Respondents are more likely to trust
       interviewers if they do so. They should always strive to be on time, and never keep the respondent waiting.
       They should exercise patience and tact, and avoid angering the respondent at any time.
  ▪    Explain the guidelines for answering questions. The interviewers should suggest the following guidelines before
       the start of the interview, and tell the respondent that observing them will keep the interview flowing smoothly:
          a) “It is important that you answer as accurately as you can”
          b) “When a question asks for information over a period of time, like the last four weeks, take you time to
              think about it before answering. Accuracy is more important than speed”
          c) “If you become tired during the interview, or you have other things to do, please let me know. We can
              stop and continue later”
  ▪    Ask questions just as they are written. The interviewer should ask questions and give instructions exactly as they
       are written in the data collection form with no variation or change in wording:
          a) After having read the question clearly and carefully, the interviewer should wait for a response. If the
              respondent does not give an answer, there are several possibilities: the respondent has not heard the
              question; s/he does not know the answer; s/he does not wish to answer; or s/he does not understand
              the question. The interviewer may repeat the question and/or emphasize that no answer will be
              revealed to others. S/he may ask the respondent if the question was understood.
          b) Maintain a neutral attitude. It is extremely important that the interviewer keeps a neutral attitude about
              the questions s/he asks and the answers the respondent gives. Most people want to show their best, so



Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                     65
              they will be watching interviewers carefully from any hints about how to respond a question. If the
              interviewer shows surprise, approval or disapproval, this will affect the responses. No matter what a
              respondent says, the interviewer must not reveal what s/he thinks about the answer. If the respondent
              asks them what they think of a particular subject or response s/he has given, interviewers should reply
              that they would be happy to talk about it after the interview is finished. Chances are that the respondent
              will forget to ask them.
         c)   Probe and help the respondents recall. If a respondent gives an incomplete or unsatisfactory answer, the
              interviewer must probe by asking a follow-up question such as “What exactly do you mean by that?”,
              “Anything else?”, “Tell me more about…”, or simply repeating the question can be a way to probe.
         d)   Thank the respondent for their time and cooperation. The interviewer should be sure to thank all
              respondents for taking part in the interview when they are finished.

When the interviewer has finished an interview, s/he should immediately go through the completed data collection
form and check that all sections have been filled out correctly and legibly. If the interviewer discovers that any section
or question was not completed, s/he must contact the respondent again; this should happen before the interviewer
tells the respondent that the interview is finished.



3. The Data Collection Form: General Instructions
A few important features and procedures related to the data collection form are listed below:


    3.1. Complete the Data Collection Form during the Interview

All relevant information should be recorded in the data collection form during the interview. The interviewer should
not record the answer on scraps of paper and transfer them to the data collection form later, or rely on memory for
filling in the answers into the data collection form after the interview.

Further, one data collection form should be used per respondent. The interviewer should use one data collection form
for every respondent to avoid that data will be mixed up.


    3.2. Question Numbers

The question numbers in the data collection form have two parts. The first part indicates the section, and the second
part is the number of the question within the section. For example, Section 1. SCREENING INFORMATION has 7
questions. The question numbers will then be 1.01, 1.02, etc. to 1.07. Hence, the first question of section 2 will be
2.01. This is very useful for understanding the skip pattern instructions (later in this manual).

    3.3. Asking Questions

The formatting and layout of the data collection form are designed to make the question-and-answer process as easy
as possible, both for the interviewer and the respondent. Several typographical conventions will help the interviewer
ask the questions in the correct way.

Not all text is a question. The data collection form guides and helps the interviewer in introducing the questions, and
transitioning to the next section. The interviewer should read aloud the text before the first section.



      Hello, my name is [INSERT YOUR NAME], I am collecting data for a World Bank report. The report is following up on the
      results of the [INSERT THE NAME OF THE PROJECT] project. The report is trying to understand the progress made
      through the intervention. You are being interviewed as a beneficiary of the [INSERT THE NAME OF THE PROJECT]
      project, along with the other participants of the project, to provide intermediate results that will allow to adapt the
      intervention, if necessary. The information you provide is strictly confidential and will be used only in aggregated form
      for research. We intend to prepare a report that contains the aggregated responses to the questions I am about to ask.
      Please be assured that all answers will be treated as strictly confidential.




      1. SCREENING INFORMATION

     (1.01)       Name of beneficiary
                  First
                  Name


                  Last
                  Name


Text that is written in capital letters (LIKE THIS) is an instruction to the interviewer. It should not be read aloud to the
respondent. For example:

                     (2.01)      In w hich stage of the training program are y ou currently in?
                                                  Currently enrolled                              1
                                                  Already completed                               2
                                                  Was enrolled, but dropped out                   3       ►   END INTERVIEW


“END INTERVIEW” is an instruction to the interviewer and should not be read aloud.

Further, never read aloud the option “OTHER, SPECIFY”:

                  (4.01)      In your current main activity, do you work as…


                                          Employee (with salary or wage)                              1   ►     (4.06)
                                          Self-employed, own account worker, an owner with
                                                                                                      2
                                          hired labor
                                          Self-employed, own account worker, an owner without
                                                                                                      3   ►     (4.03)
                                          hired labor
                                          Unpaid worker in family business                            4   ►     (4.04)
                                          OTHER, SPECIFY                     96   ►      (4.03)




If the respondent tells the interviewer that the answer s/he is looking for is not on the list, the interviewer then asks
the respondent to specify.

Coding as OTHER an answer that has a code is an indicator of a poorly performed interview.

Text that is written in a normal typeface (like this) should be read aloud to the respondent. These are the questions the
interviewer must ask. Using the example above, “In your current main activity, do you work as…?” is the question
which should be read aloud to the respondent.

Do not read aloud the numbers. The respondent does not need to know that the interviewer is asking question number
2.01.

The same way, code numbers, for instance “1 (currently enrolled)” are not relevant to the respondent. As mentioned
before, if it helps the respondent to provide an answer, the interviewer might need to read aloud the text of the three
possible answers. In this case, the interviewer does only read aloud the text, not the code number.


    3.4. Coding Answers

Most of the answers in the data collection form are pre-coded, that is, a list of possible answers follows the question,
and the interviewer has to write down the corresponding code in the Answer Box. In a few cases, the interviewer must
write the answer as it is given.

When the answer is a name, or a number, the interviewer should write this as the respondent tells it. For example, the
answer was “Yes, two guys, both permanent, and none other”. In this case, the interviewer should write “2” in the
box for Permanent employees, and “0” (zero) in the box of Temporary/Seasonal employees.

                  (4.02)     How many paid or unpaid employees do you have (permanent or temporary/seasonal)?


                                                                                                           NB OF EMPLOYEES
                                              A       Permanent employees


                                              B       Temporary/Seasonal employees




If the interviewer asks this question, and the answer is something like “I have no employees whatsoever”, then the
interviewer should have had this question skipped. Skip patterns are explained in the next section.


    3.5. Skip Pattern

When a question does not apply to a particular respondent, it must be skipped. The data collection form provides this
information to tell the interviewer where to go next when some questions have to be skipped. Note that, depending
on the answer to some questions, all the rest of the interview does not apply, thus the interview has come to its end.

For example:

                    (3.06)    Are y ou going back to the same business / w ork /
                                                                                          YES   1   ►    (4.01)

Question 3.06: An answer of “Yes” to question 8 skips to question 4.01, without asking questions 3.07 to 3.10. An
answer of “No” has no skip instruction, this means that the interviewer continues with the next question, question
3.07.

Question 3.07: An answer of “Yes” to question 3.07 skips question 3.08 and goes to question 3.09. An answer of “No”
has no skip instruction, the interviewer continues with the next question, question 3.08.

Question 3.08: An answer of “Yes” has no skip so the interviewer continues with the next question. An answer of “No”
to question 3.08 means that the interview comes to an end. If the interviewer reaches this point, s/he checks that all
the prior answers are properly recorded, thanks the respondent, and finishes the interview.

Question 3.09: An answer of “Yes” has no skip so it continues to the next question. An answer of “No” to question
3.09 means that the interview comes to an end. If the interviewer reaches this point, s/he checks that all the prior
answers are properly recorded, thanks the respondent, and finishes the interview.

Note that if the interviewer reaches question 3.10, no matter the answer, the interview comes to an end. If the
interviewer reaches this point, s/he checks that all the prior answers are properly recorded, thanks the respondent,
and finishes the interview.

The interviewer should follow the instructions carefully. Respondents are very annoyed by this particular type of
interviewing mistakes, and it may even lead to the termination of the interview; in which case, data will not be useable.


      3.6. Data Entry Considerations

All data written on the data collection form later have to be entered in a data entry system. To minimise mistakes, the
interviewer should:

  ▪    Clearly write the names of persons, places, etc.;
  ▪    Write answers to questions only in the boxes or columns of the data collection form. Avoid writing notes or
       comments, or writing units;
  ▪    Avoid going beyond the space allotted for the answer to a question. Avoid doing so, even if the next space is not
       used. If the space provided is not enough, the interviewer should make a note of it separately and inform the
       supervisor about the problem;
  ▪    Use a pen to complete the data collection form. If the interviewer makes a writing error, s/he should cross it
       out clearly and write the correct entry.

Following these instructions are important to avoid recording incorrect data in the data entry system.


      3.7. Conventions for Number and Quantities

To reduce errors during data entry, the interviewer should strive, as far as possible, to take into account the following
rules and conventions:

  ▪    Write numbers only in western script. Pay special attention to clearly differentiate numbers 1 from 7, 3 from 8,
       and 4 from 9.




  ▪    In writing amounts and figures, always separate each group of three figures with a comma, starting from the
       right. For instance, “one hundred thousand” must be written as “100,000”, not as “100000”, or “10,00,00”.
  ▪    For questions to which the reply is a quantity or amount, the interviewer should write only the numeral in the
       appropriate box, without the unit of measure. If for example the answer to a question is “fifty US dollars”, the
       interviewer should record this as “50”, not $50.
  ▪    Zeroes and blanks. The interviewer should understand the difference between zero (“0”) and blank (empty
       answer). S/he should write “0” when the answer to a question asking for an amount or a quantity is “zero” or
       “nothing” or “none”. For instance:




Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                 70
                    (4.03)     How much w ere y our cash earnings for the past month? IN
                               LOCAL CURRENCY UNITS


       Let’s suppose that someone with a job did not get paid last month. This may happen, yet it is not the most
       likely case. In this event, the interviewer should write “0”.

       A question is left blank (without answer) when there is a skip in a previous question and the interviewer is not
       supposed to read the question to the respondent, or when the respondent does not provide an answer
       (respondent refuses to answer; s/he does not remember; or s/he does not know). In other words, a question
       left blank means there is no answer to that question.


    3.8. Time Reference Periods

Some questions in the data collection form ask respondents to recall whether they have done a particular action
within a given time period. This given period of time is called the “reference period” or “recall period”.

In case below, the data collection form uses the past seven days preceding the interview. For instance:

                  (3.02)     During the past 7 days, have you worked for at least an hour on a farm owned or rented by you or a
                             member of your household?
                             Examples are cultivating crops or in other farm maintenance tasks, or caring for livestock belonging to you or
                             a member of your household

                                                                                        YES            1     ►       (4.01)
                                                                                        NO             2


Past 7 days: If the interview takes place on May 10, the reference period covers the seven days between May 3 to
May 9 (the day before the interview, which is “yesterday”).

Past 4 weeks: if the interview takes place on May 10, the reference period covers the days April 18 to May 9 (the day
before the interview, which is “yesterday”).

Next 2 weeks: if the interview takes place on May 10, the reference period covers the days May 11 to May 25; which
is the two weeks starting “tomorrow”.

Past month: if the interview takes place on May, the past month is April. In many cases this will be easy to understand
by the interviewer. However, in some cases it can be tricky. If the interview takes place on the first days of any given
month, then the answer can be “I haven’t been paid for last month’s work yet”. Then, you will have to refer to the
last received payment.



4. Definition of Key Concepts

    4.1. Individual Project Beneficiaries

Individual beneficiaries include project participants who seek a job or aspire to improve their employability or
earnings, subsistence farmers, and self-employed individuals. Interventions targeting individual beneficiaries include
Labor Programs such as public employment services, wage subsidies and public works, as well as interventions
promoting sustainable livelihoods and income-generating activities. In certain circumstances, households can be
captured as individual beneficiaries.

    4.2. Employment

Person with employment: person of working-age who during a specified period of time, such as one week or one day,
either: (a) performed work for wage or salary in cash or in kind; or (b) performed work for profit or family gain in cash
or in kind; or (c) performs work on a regular basis, but was temporarily absent from work during the reference period.
The definition thus includes both, self- and wage employed beneficiaries


    4.3. Self-Employment

Self-employment jobs are those jobs where the remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits derived from the
goods or services produced (where own consumption is considered to be part of profits).


    4.4. Earnings

Remuneration that project beneficiary obtains from his or her work, in cash or in kind.


    4.5. Hours Worked

Actual hours worked include work hours of full-time, part-time and part-year workers, paid and unpaid overtime,
hours worked in additional jobs. It excludes time not worked because of public holidays, annual paid leave, own illness,
injury and temporary disability, maternity leave, parental leave, schooling or training, slack work for technical or
economic reasons, strike or labor dispute, bad weather, compensation leave and other reasons.



5. Sections of the Data Collection Form
The data collection form is organised in different sections:


    5.1. Screening Information

The information collected in the first section are essential so the beneficiary can be individualised as a unique case.
The interviewer should write down the required information using CAPITAL LETTERS.

Question 1.02: The interviewer should make sure the address is correct and allows effectively finding the location of
the household of the respondent.

Question 1.03: If the respondent does not have an email address, the interviewer leaves the response blank; the
interviewer should not write down the fact there is no such information. Instead, the interviewer takes a note on
his/her notebook, clearly identifying the case, and informs the supervisor. The same rule applies to all questions in
the data collection form.

Question 1.04: The interviewer should record as many family members’ phone numbers as possible, as it will be the
key for the project to reach the person in the future. Experience throughout the world shows that the more contact
phones are recorded by the time of the interview, the dramatically greater the chances to reach that person in the
future. This will require the interviewer to remind the respondent of the confidentiality of the information s/he is
collecting, and that this information will not be divulged or used by institutions or persons outside the project.

Question 1.06: The question asks only for the year of birth of the beneficiary, not the exact date of birth of the
respondent.

Question 1.07: For recording the date of interview, the interviewer should follow the instructions present in the data
collection form: two digits for day and month, and four digits for the year. For example, if the respondent is a male
born in 1997 and the interview takes place on May 4th 2018, the way to record this is:

                    (1.05)   Gender of beneficiary                               Male      1
                                                                                 Female    2


                    (1.06)   Year of birth of beneficiary



                    (1.07)   Date of interv iew (DD-MM-YYYY)          DD       MM              YYY




      5.2. Completion of Project Training Program

This section contains one question, Question 2.01. However, it is extremely important. Note that if the respondent
was enrolled in the training program, but dropped out from it, the interview will come to an end. Otherwise, if the
respondent is currently enrolled in the training program or has completed the training at the time of the interview,
the interview continues.


      5.3. Employment Status of Beneficiaries

This section screens whether the respondent is currently (self- or wage) employed, unemployed or not participating
in the labour market (inactive). Refer to the previous definition of employment in Section 4.1. The definition is
translated in the data collection form in the form of several questions to be asked the respondent (questions 3.01 to
3.06).

Pay special attention to the reference periods of the questions: Questions 3.01 to 3.06 refer to the past 7 days.
Questions 3.07 and 3.08 refer to the past 4 weeks. Refer to Section 3.8 of this guide: Time Reference Periods.


      5.4. Self- or Wage Employment Information

This final section collects information on the job of the respondent and its benefits. In general, the questions allow to
determine the following aspects:

  ▪    Whether the respondent is self- or wage employed;
  ▪    If self-employed:
          -    Whether the respondent employs other people and if so, how many;
          -    How long it takes the respondent to get to closest market to sell or trade products;
          -    Whether the respondent is member of a cooperative or producer group.
  ▪    Annual earnings (both, in cash and in-kind) of the respondent for the reference period;
  ▪    Number of hours worked by the respondent;
  ▪    Whether the respondent is covered by social security insurance (pension insurance, health insurance,
       unemployment insurance, other);
  ▪    How satisfied the respondent is with his/her (main) job.

The interviewer should keep in mind that the definition of employment includes being engaged in an economic activity
for which the respondent may or may not be paid, for instance, a person working in a family business without being
paid will also be answering this section.

The following questions require a closer look.

Question 4.02: How many paid or unpaid employees do you over the last year (permanent or temporary/seasonal)? For
example, the respondent may have two persons working on a permanent basis and hired one temporary worker
during high season:

                                                                                NB OF EMPLOYEES
                              A    Permanent employees


                              B    Temporary/Seasonal employees




Question 4.03: How much were your cash earnings for the last month? This is the month prior to the month when the
interview takes place. The interviewer should explain to the respondent that the last month is not the current one,
but the one prior to the month of the interview.

Question 4.04: Do you receive payments in-kind for this work? In-kind payments are payments of goods, commodities
or services instead of money

Question 4.05: What is the estimated value of the in-kind payments you received for this work (for the past month)? This
is the month prior to the month when the interview occurs. If a person says they received in-kind payments, the
interviewer asks him/her to estimate the monetary value of such payments.

Question 4.08: How much was your gross payment (before any payroll taxes and social security deductions) for the last
pay period? In this case, the interviewer will have to record two different pieces of information: First, the amount
received and second, the pay period (which in most cases is daily, weekly, biweekly or fortnightly, monthly; annual
payments are rare). In the unlikely event that the pay period is not listed, the interviewer should circle option 9 (Other)
and provide a brief description. Remember that gross payment or gross salary is the aggregate amount of wages
received on a regular basis, usually weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, prior to any deductions such as federal and state
taxes.

Question 4.11: How long does it take you to get to the closest market where products can be sold or traded? The answer
can be provided in many ways, some could say “90 minutes”, other will say “One and a half hours”, or even “One
point five hours”. Other possible responses could be “nothing” or “too long”. The variability of the possible answers
is a problem the interviewer will have to solve. If possible, the interviewer records the answer in a standard way. Using
the examples mentioned earlier: “90 minutes” = “One and half hours” = “One point five hours”. In this case, the
interviewer records the answer as follows:

                                                         HOURS MINUTES




If the respondent answers e.g. “nothing”, “too long”, the interviewer will have to probe the responded an evaluation
rather than a precise information. The interviewer informs the respondent that s/he requires an answer allowing to
record the time measured in hours and minutes.




Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                   74
Further, the interviewer should always fill both fields (Hours and Minutes) to indicate that no information was
forgotten to be recorded. Examples:

                            HOURS MINUTES                                         HOURS MINUTES
 “One hour”                                            “15 minutes”


Question 4.13: How many hours do you currently work in a typical week? It is important that the interviewer makes
sure that the respondent understands the sense of “typical”. If the respondent does not fully understand, the
respondent can use the words “usually work” or “normally work in a week”. Workload is not always the same
throughout the year: The respondent may have an increased or decreased workload during a period in the quarter,
or during a particular period in the year, which is not representative for the rest of the time. The interviewer should
make sure that the respondents understands that s/he is asking for the number of hours worked during a normal
week of the year.

A second aspect that is important to understand in the question is the number of hours worked: most formal jobs
have pre-defined work hours or shifts, limited to a reasonable number of hours per day. The interviewer should
normally except answers varying from 1 to 60 hours a week. Beyond these limits, the interviewer should probe the
respondent; s/he should tell the respondent that, e.g. 70 hours a week would represents 10 hours a day every day of
the week, including Saturday or Sunday. If after probing, the respondent insists on the number, then the interviewer
records the information.

Question 4.15: What is the reason that you do not work more hours at the moment? The question wants to understand
the reasons why someone says that s/he wants to work more hours, but currently does not do so. The interviewers
should let the respondent tell him/her in his/her own words any reasons for not working more hours; the interviewer
should record 1 (YES) for as many answers as mentioned, choosing from the ones provided. Further, the interviewer
should record 2 (NO) for the reasons that the respondent did not mention. To make sure the respondent has not
forgotten other possibilities, the interviewer can probe him/her by asking “Any other reason?”.

Question 4.16: For how many weeks did you work in the last year? This question poses a similar problem than question
4.13: The interviewer will need to record a number of weeks and may need to help the respondent in estimating the
number of weeks s/he worked during the last 12 months. To do so, the interviewer may remind the respondent that
a year has 52 weeks. No answer can go beyond that calendar reality. If the year is 52 weeks long and the respondent
took 2 weeks off, then the interviewer should record 50.

Special cases may occur when the respondent took e.g. 10 days off: 10 days is 3 days more than a week. As a rule of
thumb, the interviewer should round the 10 days up to 2 weeks, recording 50 weeks of work in the last 12 months.
The information the interviewer records will be interpreted as “ The respondent did work at least 50 weeks during the
12 months prior to the interview”.

Question 4.20: How satisfied are you with your job? If the respondent has trouble in making his/her mind, the
interviewer can repeat the question. Only then, the interviewer should help the respondent by reading aloud all
possible answers. The interviewer should be as neutral as possible when reading the answers, as even a minimal voice
change could influence the respondent.

6. Further Aspects to Consider for Paper Based Data Collection
In case of paper based data collection, the supervisor and Data Entry Team should further take into consideration the
following aspects:

  ▪   The supervisor makes sure the interviewer is providing all the expected complete data collection forms – one
      per respondent.
  ▪   The supervisor will review the integrity of the data collection forms. Are all expected data recorded? Is there
      missing information (empty questions where information is expected)? Is there unexpected information
      (information present when question is skipped)?
  ▪   In case of missing information, the interviewer must either complete the form, or provide a satisfactory
      explanation in the form of a comment. For instance, it is possible that the respondent does not know whether
      s/he is covered by an unemployment insurance scheme and the interviewer decided not to fill the field by the
      time of the interview. This information has to be validated by the supervisor after re-contacting the respondent.
      If the situation persists, there is no alternative but leaving the question empty. It is important for the
      Management Team to have a sense of how often such a situation occurs for a team or a particular interviewer.
      If after a while, the trends are systematic, the Management Team has to instruct the supervisor on how to
      proceed.
  ▪   Once the forms are checked, the supervisor will put all the complete and incomplete data collection forms in a
      box, ordered by interviewer.
  ▪   The box has to be labelled with the information of the site, the visit date to the site, team number and code,
      supervisor name and code.
  ▪   Inside the box, an information sheet with information on the box contents’ is included:
         -    Total number of data collection forms;
         -    Total number of complete data collection forms;
         -    Total number of incomplete data collection forms;
         -    Total data collection forms per interviewer;
         -    Total complete data collection forms per interviewer;
         -    Total incomplete data collection forms per interviewer.
      This information is important to keep track of all the contents coming from the field.
  ▪   The box will be sent to the site where the Data Entry Team is recording data. The Data Entry Team receives the
      box by confirming that the content of the box and the information on the information sheet correspond.
  ▪   Every box is assigned to one data entry operator, who is responsible to correctly record the data from all the
      data collection forms in the box. After data entry is complete, all the data collection forms go back in the box.
      Entered data must match the number of forms present in the box.
  ▪   All boxes must be stored in a safe, private and dry room, ready for inspection. It is expected that when an
      external team visits the local project, they can produce in no-time a box, so the databases can be checked
      against the data collection forms. Nothing can be lost in translation!

1. Introduction

     1.1. Objectives of the Survey

[TO BE ADAPTED BY THE PROJECT TEAM: BACKGROUND AND GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION: NAME OF THE
PROJECT, OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND TIMEFRAME]

Note that for the purpose of administering the Jobs Data Collection Form among Firms and Farms, the following
definition of firm-level beneficiaries is used:

Firm beneficiaries refer to the entity directly participating in the project intervention. The te rm “firm” in this toolkit
refers to the establishment. This is because an establishment may be part of a larger firm, but data collected under
this project must correspond to the specific establishment receiving support/targeted by the intervention. 15 Therefore,
if the firm has only one establishment, there is little practical difference between the establishment and the firm.
However, if the firm has multiple establishments (and the sampling frame we use makes it possible to distinguish
among them) each of this establishments is a sampling unit (therefore, it is possible to theoretically interview more
than one establishment belonging to the same firm). If a project seeks data at the establishment level or many
establishments of the same firm, then data must be aggregated for reporting on indicators.

[Project teams led by World Bank (WB) Task Team Leaders (TTLs) will provide guidance on how to best adapt the
terminology most relevant for the country, legal, and beneficiary specific context of the project…]


     1.2. Field Staff

Interview sites16 are allocated on a schedule and assigned to various field teams so as to balance workload and travel
time across each team. Overall, there will be [XX] teams working throughout the [COUNTRY OR INTERVENTION
AREAS]. Each team has been assigned sites in one particular area in the country. All members of a team will work
together in one site each [TIME UNIT]. Every interviewer will be allocated the same workload per site. Each team
consists of a supervisor, [NN] interviewers. [IF APPLICABLE ADD: A DATA ENTRY OPERATOR].


     1.3. Field Team Composition and its Place in the Survey Structure

While the data collection teams are deployed in the field, they are part of a bigger structure: the structure is
composed by the management team and the field teams. The management team is led by the Survey Manager, who
has the overall responsibility of the study. Two collaborators are assisting the Survey Manager: The Field-Operations
Manager and the Data Manager.

The Field Operations Manager coordinates the activities of the field teams and ensures that the field teams are
equipped with all necessary resources to carry out high-quality data collection in a timely manner. The Data Manager
builds up the database. This happens through the close inspection and continuous monitoring of the in-progress


15
   Ideally, project results reporting should be consistent with the Enterprise Survey (ES) methodology. The ES defines ‘firms’ a s
business organizations composed of one or more establishments that are specified under common ownership or control; and
‘establishments’ as the physical location where business is conducted or where services or operations are performed.

   Interview sites will include variation in terms of the numbers of establishments/interviews to be conducted. Field teams may
note there may also be challenges with regards to logistics and availability of respondents due to regional factors.

Composition of a field team:

The supervisor is the main link between the management team and the interviewers. S/he will oversee, coordinate,
monitor, and -when necessary- correct the work of the interviewers.

The interviewers will be responsible for collecting the data from selected beneficiaries in each site, helping in better
understanding the local customs and dialects, as well as administering the data collection form.

[IF DATA ENTRY IN THE FIELD] The data entry operator will be responsible for capturing all paper-based data in
electronic format. As the data entry program will flag internal data inconsistencies and errors, the data entry operator
will have to report them to the supervisor for correction.


      1.4. Survey Plan

The [NN] teams will interview the [XXXX] selected beneficiaries over the course of a [WW-WEEKS] period. As
mentioned earlier, each team will visit 1 site per [TIME-UNIT]. During this period, each interviewer will interview
[XXXX] beneficiaries, thus covering [YYY] beneficiaries each [TIME-PERIOD].


      1.5. Field Team Roles

         1.5.1. The Role of the Supervisor
The supervisor is the main link between the teams and the Survey office in [CENTRAL LOCATION], and s/he represents
the core management team in the field. The supervisor has the following main tasks:

  ▪    The supervisor will provide the field staff with blank data collection forms and other materials (pencil,
       notebooks etc.), and will every day accompany the team to the interviewing site.
  ▪    [ONLY IN THE CASE OF USING A SAMPLING STRATEGY] In the event that a replacement of a selected beneficiary
       is necessary, the supervisor will assign the new beneficiary to the interviewer and will record this operation.




Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                81
  ▪   The supervisor will examine all the data collection forms completed by the field staff. S/he will verify that the
      data collection forms are complete and properly filled-in. In cases where further work or corrections are
      needed, the supervisor will accordingly instruct the interviewer.
  ▪   The supervisor will, on a regular basis, observe interviews carried out by the interviewers to evaluate their
      work. S/he will help the interviewers maintain good professional practice over time by providing them with an
      objective viewpoint on their performance with regards to respect of standard interview practice. Observing
      interviews in the field regularly will also help keep the supervisor aware of any problems faced by the
      interviewers.
  ▪   The supervisor will keep the management team informed of the performance of the interviewers in the field.
      S/he will make regular evaluation reports that will cover their behaviour and appearance during interviews, the
      quality of the interviews, and their working relationship with the supervisor and other team members. At the
      end of each [TIME UNIT], s/he will send an evaluation report to the management team. It is recommended that
      this report is sent weekly in the first weeks of fieldwork, when the teams are more in need of all possible
      support. Later, this report can be produced bi-weekly or monthly.
  ▪   The supervisor will help the interviewers to solve any problems they encounter during the course of their work
      in a manner that is consistent with the rules and procedures set for field work by the management team. The
      supervisor of each team will hold regular meetings with all team members [IF ONLY INTERVIEWERS, PLACE
      INTERVIEWERS, IF INCLUDING A DATA ENTRY OPERATOR, WRITE “BOTH, INTERVIEWERS AND DATA ENTRY
      OPERATOR] about how their work is going. The interviewers [AND DATA ENTRY OPERATOR] must keep their
      supervisor immediately informed of any difficulties or problems that they encounter.
  ▪   [IF DATA ENTRY IN THE FIELD:] The supervisor will be the referee for determining who is responsible for
      correcting an encountered error or inconsistency. The supervisor will determine whether the inconsistency or
      error is present on the paper-based form (interviewer error) or if this error is a data-entry typo (entry-error).
      When an interviewer-error is detected, the interviewer will be prompted to correct it (if needed, by re-
      interviewing the respondent) and only then the data will be entered by the data entry operator. If it is a data-
      entry error, the supervisor will instruct the data-entry operator to fix the problem.
  ▪   [IN CASE OF PAPER-BASED INTERVIEWS:] The supervisor will create the Site Folder, which contains all data
      collection forms, both complete and incomplete, ordered by interviewer including the following information:
      (a) Total number of forms; (b) Total number of complete forms; (c) Total number of incomplete forms; (d) Total
      number of forms by interviewer.

What happens when one interviewer produces too many mistakes? The supervisor will assist the interviewer to
improve his/her work. For instance, the interviewer will need a refreshment on the most frequent errors; the
supervisor will probably have to accompany the interviewer for a few interviews and directly supervise his/her job. In
any case, the supervisor must include any problems encountered in the reports to the management team so that they
may assist the supervisor to take appropriate actions.

What happens when the data entry operator is producing too many mistakes? The data entry operator will receive an
immediate feedback while entering the collected data. The supervisor will assist the data entry operator to improve
his/her performance. In any case, the supervisor must include any problems encountered in the reports to the
management team so that they may assist the supervisor to take appropriate actions.


         1.5.2. The Role of the Interviewer
The interviewers are the foundation of the quality and usefulness of the collected data. The success of the entire data
collection process ultimately depends upon the care the interviewers take in collecting and recording the information.
The information they collect will be used to track the achievements of the [NAME OF PROJECT] and inform decision-
making in the management of the project. Incomplete or inaccurate data may lead to wrong decisions. For this reason,
it is imperative that the interviewers must work carefully and systematically to obtain accurate and complete



Version 1  June 2017                                                                                               82
information from the respondents. It is very important for the interviewers to pay close attention during each
interview, watching and listening carefully to detect any problems that may occur so that they can discuss them with
their supervisor. The interviewer must also check the integrity of the collected data: in each data collection form, s/he
has to make sure that all required information is present.

It is important that the interviewers keep in mind three general rules during the interview:

  ▪   Identify the most suitable respondent at the establishment or farm. The most knowledgeable respondent may
      vary depending on the information you will be asking for. In small businesses or farms, it is likely that one
      informant will manage all required information; in bigger and/or more structured businesses, it might be
      necessary to contact more than one respondent (for instance, the CEO will be able to answer most of the
      information but will address you to the Human Resources person responsible for detailed information on the
      workforce).
  ▪   Read the questions exactly as they appear in the data collection form. The interviewers should not shorten or
      change the wording of the questions, and should avoid interpreting a question for the respondent unless s/he
      is unable to understand the question as stated. If interpretation is needed, this should happen in a neutral way,
      without suggesting an answer.
  ▪   Ensure confidentiality. All information collected is confidential, and must not be divulged. If the respondent
      knows this, they are more likely to give fruitful answers. As far as possible, the interviewer should try to
      interview all respondents privately.

It is very likely that the field staff will have to work long and sometimes unusual hours during the field work, and will
have to adapt themselves to the schedule of their respondents. In rural areas, they will have to adjust to the daily and
seasonal agricultural cycle. During certain times of the year farmers have reasonable amounts of free time, while
during other parts of the year they are very busy, and interviewers will have to perform their job after their work is
done or between tasks.

To carry out the interview, the field staff will need the following materials: (a) Data Collection Manual; (b) Data
collection form (one per establishment or farm); (c) Writing pad; (d) Identification Card; (e) Lead Pencils; (f) Eraser;
(g) [IF NEEDED:] Laptop or Tablet. The material will be provided to the interviewers by the supervisor. It is the
responsibility of the interviewers to make sure that they have the material with them at all times during the field work.


         1.5.3. The Role of the Data Entry Operator
The main role of the Data Entry Operator is to capture in an electronic format all the information present in the data
collection forms completed by the interviewers. This job is to be performed on a daily basis. The Data Entry Operator
is joining the team during the field work, as data entry is an integral part of the data quality-chain.

The Data Entry Operator has to enter the data as it is on the complete form. No editing or changing data is allowed.
The Data Entry Program will issue warning messages when an error or an inconsistency is found as the Data Entry
Operator captures the data. The Data Entry Operator is not allowed to modify the data; data must be recorded as
stated in the data collection forms.

Some questions may have left blank by the interviewer in the data collection form. This may be the case for three
reasons:

  ▪   It is a skipped question, in which case, no data is expected;
  ▪   No information was provided by the respondent;
  ▪   The interviewer made a mistake and the data collection form is not complete.




Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                 83
If data is missing because it is a skipped question, then data entry in the system will not be a problem. However, if the
data entry program does not skip the question and the Data Entry Operator is prompted to enter data, it means,
either:

  ▪    The Data Entry Operator has entered a wrong code in a previous question; meaning the program is expecting
       data. In this case, the Data Entry Operator needs to check the previous questions and check the codes entered;
  ▪    If no information was provided by the respondent, the Data Entry Operator should expect to see a comment
       from the interviewer explaining why. The Data Entry Operator has to inform the supervisor, for him/her to
       decide on how to proceed.
  ▪    If the interviewer made a mistake, i.e. it is not a skipped question, the prior codes are correct, but the
       interviewer did not record any information; the Data Entry Operator must leave the question blank, as it is on
       the data collection form. The Data Entry Operator has to inform the supervisor, for him/her to decide on how
       to proceed.

Another important source of errors is when no data is expected for a question, but the question does have data. This
may be the case when the interviewer did not respect the skip instructions. The Data Entry Operator must
nevertheless enter the data, as recorded in the data collection form. In this case, the Data Entry Operator will receive
a message that “Information in question XX has been found, yet this is a skipped question”. In this case, capturing the
data is important, so that the supervisor may follow up with the interviewer and ensure a high quality of the data
collection.

Once the Data Entry Operator has entered all the data of the data collection form, the program will issue a report
detailing the entered cases and the errors or inconsistencies found. If errors or inconsistencies were found, the
supervisor has to be informed immediately to check whether the encountered errors or inconsistencies are related
to the data entry (a typo), or whether they are present in the data collection form.

If the errors or inconsistencies are related to the data entry, they must be corrected. If they are present in the data
collection form, the supervisor will instruct the interviewer to correct the mistake(s). Only once the interviewer has
corrected the errors, or provided a comment explaining why the inconsistency is the actual fact, or the respondent
does not have the information, data entry may be completed.

It is important that the Data Entry Operator does never guess what the information might be. Also, the Data Entry
Operator must never correct any information present in the data collection form.


      1.6. Interacting with the Local Project Staff and Respondents

Arrival at the site. By the time the interviewers arrive at the new site for the first time, the supervisor will already have
contacted the local person responsible for [PROJECT] and officials to explain the purpose of the data collection. When
the interviewers arrive, the supervisor will introduce them to these key individuals.

When contacting the respondents. On arrival at a new site, after having been introduced to officials, the interviewers
must contact the respondents who are to participate in the study, according to a planning predefined by the
supervisor and communicated to the interviewers. The supervisor will accompany the interviewers for the
introductory part of the interview. The interviewer will introduce him/herself, explain the purpose of the interview,
the confidentiality of the data gathered, and confirm that the respondent is willing to be interviewed.

In order to obtain or maintain trust and cooperation, the interviewer should explain to or remind the respondents
that the confidentiality of the information collected will be maintained at all times, that both their personal identity
as the establishment/farm’s name will not be divulged to others, that data will never be used for taxation or other
purposes, and will only be presented in aggregate forms, thus no particular establishment can be identified.

Any difficulties that the interviewers may experience during the preparation of the interview should be brought to
the immediate attention of their supervisor who will take necessary action.



2. The Interview
Listed below are some general rules for interviewers to follow when they conduct the interviews:

  ▪    Maintain good conduct. Interviewers should always be courteous toward everyone. They should treat other
       team members and all respondents and their communities with respect. The interviewers’ behaviour can have
       an enormous influence on the opinions of the people in areas where they work, and whether respondents view
       the data collection as worthwhile depends heavily on it.
       Interviewers should always behave in culturally appropriate ways. They should avoid behaviour that people
       find disturbing or upsetting. They should always be properly dressed. Respondents are more likely to trust
       interviewers if they do so. They should always strive to be on time, and never keep the respondent waiting.
       They should exercise patience and tact, and avoid angering the respondent at any time.
  ▪    Explain the guidelines for answering questions. The interviewers should suggest the following guidelines before
       the start of the interview, and tell the respondent that observing them will keep the interview flowing smoothly:
          d) “It is important that you answer as accurately as you can”
          e) “When a question asks for information over a period of time, like the last four weeks, take you time to
               think about it before answering. Accuracy is more important than speed”
          f) “If you become tired during the interview, or you have other things to do, please let me know. We can
               stop and continue later”
  ▪    Ask questions just as they are written. The interviewer should ask questions and give instructions exactly as they
       are written in the data collection form with no variation or change in wording:
            a) After having read the question clearly and carefully, the interviewer should wait for a response. If the
                respondent does not give an answer, there are several possibilities: the respondent has not heard the
                question; s/he does not know the answer; s/he does not wish to answer; or s/he does not understand
                the question. The interviewer may repeat the question and/or emphasize that no answer will be
                revealed to others. S/he may ask the respondent if the question was understood.
            b) Maintain a neutral attitude. It is extremely important that the interviewer keeps a neutral attitude about
                the questions s/he asks and the answers the respondent gives. Most people want to show their best,
                so they will be watching interviewers carefully from any hints about how to respond a question. If the
                interviewer shows surprise, approval or disapproval, this will affect the responses. No matter what a
                respondent says, the interviewer must not reveal what s/he thinks about the answer. If the respondent
                asks them what they think of a particular subject or response s/he has given, interviewers should reply
                that they would be happy to talk about it after the interview is finished. Chances are that the
                respondent will forget to ask them.
            c) Probe and help the respondents recall. If a respondent gives an incomplete or unsatisfactory answer,
                the interviewer must probe by asking a follow-up question such as “What exactly do you mean by
                that?”, “Anything else?”, “Tell me more about…”, or simply repeating the question can be a way to
                probe.
            d) Thank the respondent for their time and cooperation. The interviewer should be sure to thank all
                respondents for taking part in the interview when they are finished.

When the interviewer has finished an interview, s/he should immediately go through the completed data collection
form and check that all sections have been filled out correctly and legibly. If the interviewer discovers that any section
or question was not completed, s/he must contact the respondent again; this should happen before the interviewer
tells the respondent that the interview is finished.

3. The Data Collection Form: General Instructions
A few important features and procedures related to the data collection form are listed below:


    3.1. Complete the Data Collection Form during the Interview

All relevant information should be recorded in the data collection form during the interview. The interviewer should
not record the answer on scraps of paper and transfer them to the data collection form later, or rely on memory for
filling in the answers into the data collection form after the interview.

Further, one data collection form should be used per respondent. The interviewer should use one data collection form
for every respondent to avoid that data will be mixed up.


    3.2. Question Numbers

The question numbers in the data collection form have two parts. The first part indicates the section, and the second
part is the number of the question within the section. For example, Section 1. SCREENING INFORMATION has 10
questions. The question numbers will then be 1.01, 1.02, etc. to 1.10. Hence, the first question of section 2 will be
2.01. This is very useful for understanding the skip pattern instructions (later in this manual).


                                            1. SCREENING INFORMATION

                   (1.00)   What is y our job title (main responsibility )?
                            Ow ner / Proprietor                                            1

                            Last Name




    3.3. Asking Questions

The formatting and layout of the data collection form are designed to make the question-and-answer process as easy
as possible, both for the interviewer and the respondent. Several typographical conventions will help the interviewer
ask the questions in the correct way.

Not all text is a question. The data collection form guides and helps the interviewer in introducing the questions, and
transitioning to the next section. The interviewer should read aloud the text that follows a section break.

Text that is written in capital letters (LIKE THIS) is an instruction to the interviewer. It should not be read aloud to the
respondent. For example:

                    (3.08)   How many seasonal or temporary employ ees did this [establishment/farm]
                             employ during the most recently completed [fiscal/agricultural] y ear [INSERT
                             DATE]?

[INSERT DATE] is an instruction to the interviewer and should not be read aloud.

Further, never read aloud the option “OTHER, SPECIFY”:

If the respondent tells the interviewer that the answer s/he is looking for is not on the list, the interviewer then asks
the respondent to specify.

Coding as OTHER an answer that has a code is an indicator of a poorly performed interview.

Text that is written in a normal typeface (like this) should be read aloud to the respondent. These are the questions the
interviewer must ask. Using the example above, “Please indicate your main activity” is the question which should be
read aloud to the respondent.

Do not read aloud the numbers. The respondent does not need to know that the interviewer is asking question number
3.08.

The same way, code numbers, for instance, code 1 (Yes) or code 2 (No) are not relevant to the respondent. If it helps
the respondent to provide an answer, the interviewer might need to read aloud the text of the possible answers. In
this case, the interviewer does only read aloud the text, not the code number.


    3.4. Coding Answers

Most of the answers in the data collection form are pre-coded, that is, a list of possible answers follows the question,
and the interviewer has to write down the corresponding code in the Answer Box. In a few cases, the interviewer must
write the answer as it is given.


Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                    87
When the answer is a name, or a number, the interviewer should write this as the respondent tells it. However, most
questions have codes that are presented likely answers. In the question below, the interviewer should write either 1
(Yes) or 2 (No), depending on the answer given by the respondent.

                (3.13)    Ov er the past y ear, has the [establishment/farm] hired
                                                                                               YES      1

                          Technicians and Associate Professionals




If the respondent answers “Yes, two professionals”, recording “2” will be interpreted as “NO”, hence the interviewer
would report a wrong answer!


    3.5. Skip Pattern

When a question does not apply to a particular respondent, it must be skipped. The data collection form provides this
information to tell the interviewer where to go next when some questions have to be skipped. For example:


                         (3.02)   How many permanent full-time employ ees currently w ork in this
                                  [establishment/farm]?
                                  Note: Permanent, full-time employ ees are defined as all employ ees that are
                                                                                                                          IF 0 ►

                                  employ ees and managers

                                  full-time employ ees the [establishment/farm] is currently employ ing, how many are w omen
                                  and how many are under the age of 25?

                                                                                                                  TOTAL

                         (3.04)   How many permanent part-time employ ees currently w ork in this
                                  [establishment/farm]? If 0 ► Q3.07



Question 3.02. An answer of “Zero” or “None” to question 3.02 skips to question 3.04, without asking questions 3.03,
3.03A and 3.03B. An answer of “Yes, currently we have full time employees” has no skip instruction, so this means
the interviewer should continue with the next question, question 3.03.

Questions 3.03, 3.03A and 3.03B. Imagine the interviewer forgets to skip these three questions after having an answer
of “No” in question 3.02. The interviewer just got the information that there are no full-time employees currently
working in the establishment or farm. Yet, because the interviewer did not skip this question, s/he would be asking

“Based on the ZERO permanent full-time employees the establishment is currently employing, how many of them are
women and how many are under the age of 25?”

The interviewer should follow the instructions carefully. Respondents are very annoyed by this particular type of
interviewing mistakes, and it may even lead to the termination of the interview; in which case, data will not be useable.


      3.6. Data Entry Considerations

All data written on the data collection form later have to be entered in a data entry system. To minimise mistakes, the
interviewer should:

  ▪    Clearly write the names of persons, places, etc.;
  ▪    Write answers to questions only in the boxes or columns of the data collection form. Avoid writing notes or
       comments, or writing units;
  ▪    Avoid going beyond the space allotted for the answer to a question. Avoid doing so, even if the next space is not
       used. If the space provided is not enough, the interviewer should make a note of it separately and inform the
       supervisor about the problem;
  ▪    Use a pen to complete the data collection form. If the interviewer makes a writing error, s/he should cross it
       out clearly and write the correct entry.

Following these instructions are important to avoid recording incorrect data in the data entry system.


      3.7. Conventions for Number and Quantities

To reduce errors during data entry, the interviewer should strive, as far as possible, to take into account the following
rules and conventions:

  ▪    Write numbers in western script. Pay special attention to clearly differentiate numbers 1 from 7, 3 from 8, and
       4 from 9.




  ▪    In writing amounts and figures, always separate each group of three figures with a comma, starting from the
       right. For instance, “one hundred thousand” must be written as “100,000”, not as “100000”, or “10,00,00”.
  ▪    For questions to which the reply is a quantity or amount, the interviewer should write only the numeral in the
       appropriate box, without the unit of measure. If for example the answer to a question is “fifty US dollars”, the
       interviewer should record this as “50”, not $50.
  ▪    Zeroes and blanks. The interviewer should understand the difference between zero (“0”) and blank (empty
       answer). S/he should write “0” when the answer to a question asking for an amount or a quantity is “zero” or
       “nothing” or “none”. For instance:

                      (3.02)   How many permanent full-time employ ees currently w ork in this
                               [establishment/farm]?

       Let’s suppose that there are no permanent full-time individuals currently working. In this event, the interviewer
       should write “0” in the Answer Box.

       A question is left blank (without answer) when there is a skip in a previous question and the interviewer is not
       supposed to read the question to the respondent, or when the respondent does not provide an answer
       (respondent refuses to answer; s/he does not remember; or s/he does not know). In other words, a question
       left blank means there is no answer to that question.


    3.8. Time Reference Periods

Some questions in the data collection form ask respondents to recall whether they have done a particular action
within a given time period. This given period of time is called the “reference period” or “recall period”:

Last fiscal or agricultural year: preceding the current fiscal or agricultural year of the interview. This time period is also
referred as financial year.

                      (3.01)   In the last financial y ear [INSERT FISCAL OR AGRICULTURAL YEAR],
                               how many employ ees hav e w orked in this [establishment/farm]?



The past calendar year: the year preceding the current year of the interview.

                      (3.13)   Ov er the past y ear, has the [establishment/farm] hired
                                                                                          YES   1
                               any new managers or other high skilled employ ees?

                               Technicians and Associate Professionals




Past year: if the interview takes place on May 10, 2017 the reference period covers the days May 10 2016 to May 9
2017 (the day before the interview, which is “yesterday”).



4. Definition of Key Concepts

    4.1. Beneficiary Establishments

Firm beneficiaries refer to the entity directly participating in the project intervention. The term “firm” in this toolkit
refers to the establishment. This is because an establishment may be part of a larger firm, but the data collection at
the project level must be supplying numbers about the specific establishment receiving support. If a project seeks
data at the establishment level or many establishments of the same firm, then data must be aggregated for reporting
on indicators. Ideally, project results reporting should be consistent with the Enterprise Survey (ES) methodology. The
ES defines ‘firms’ as business organizations composed of one or more establishments that are specified under
common ownership or control; and ‘establishments’ as the physical location where business is conducted or where
services or operations are performed. TTLs may need to adapt the terminology most relevant for the country, legal,
and beneficiary specific context of the project. Further guidance for the PIU and data collection firm is provided in the
Jobs M&E Toolkit: Data Collection Manual for Firm Beneficiaries.

    4.2. Entrepreneurs

An entrepreneur may be defined as the owner or manager of an enterprise, its executive director, or a member of its
managing board. Self-employed people are also commonly considered to be entrepreneurs. Definitions used by
countries to collect and or disseminate data on women’s and men’s entrepreneurship include concepts such as
owners, managers, self-employed, and employers.


    4.3. Employment

Person with employment: person of working-age who during a specified period of time, such as one week or one day,
either: (a) performed work for wage or salary in cash or in kind; or (b) performed work for profit or family gain in cash
or in kind; or (c) performs work on a regular basis, but was temporarily absent from work during the reference period.
The definition thus includes both, self- and wage employed beneficiaries


    4.4. Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) jobs

FTE jobs may follow local definitions. If not clear/unavailable, use:
  ▪ 7 or more hours a day (or 35 hours a week)
  ▪ 48 weeks in a year


    4.5. Part-Time Employment / Work

A definition proposed by the ILO defined part-time work as “regular employment in which working time is substantially
less than normal”. This definition encompasses all forms of part-time work (half-day work, work for one, two or three
days a week, etc.) and is the definition used for administrative purposes in some countries. The OECD has decided to
define part-time working in terms of the usual working hours being under 30 hours per week. However, the
respondent of the establishment or farm is who ultimately will tell you what is the local definition of part-time worker,
as the number of hours or days considered as part-time can be established at the national, regional, industrial or unit
level.


    4.6. Permanent Employment

Employees are all those workers who hold the type of job defined as paid employment jobs. Employees with stable
contacts are those employees who have had, and continue to have, an explicit (written or oral) or implicit contract of
employment, or a succession of such contracts, with the same employer on a continuous basis. On a continuous basis
implies a period of employment which is longer than a specified minimum determined according to national
circumstances.


    4.7. Temporary employment

Temporary employment comprises work under a fixed-term contract, in contrast to permanent work where there is
no end-date.

    4.8. Workers in Seasonal Employment

Workers in seasonal employment are workers who hold implicit or explicit contracts of employment where the timing
and duration of the contract is influenced by seasonal factors such as the climatic cycle, public holidays and/or
agricultural harvests.


    4.9. Hours Worked

Actual hours worked include regular work hours of full-time, part-time and part-year workers, paid and unpaid
overtime, hours worked in additional jobs, and excludes time not worked because of public holidays, annual paid
leave, own illness, injury and temporary disability, maternity leave, parental leave, schooling or training, slack work
for technical or economic reasons, strike or labor dispute, bad weather, compensation leave and other reasons.


    4.10.         Earnings of Employees

The concept of earnings typically relates to the pay that employers provide directly to their employees on a regular
basis during a specified reference period. It includes basic pay for time worked or for work done, as well as for time
not worked, such as vacation, holidays and sickness time. In addition, it also includes other payments granted by the
employer for various reasons such as: overtime work, irregular hours or schedules, difficult work, regular bonuses and
fringe benefits such as family allowances. However, it will exclude all irregular bonuses even if provided by the
employer. Earnings should be reported as gross earnings, before deductions for social security contributions or tax
deductions, etc.


    4.11.         Time to get to the Closest Market where Products can be Sold or Traded

Is the average number of hours it takes for establishments, SMEs or smallholders in the targeted region to get to the
market.



5. Sections of the Data Collection Form
The data collection form is organised into the following sections:


    5.1. Screening Information

The information collected in the first section is essential so the establishment or farm can be individualised as a unique
case. The interviewer should write down the required information using CAPITAL LETTERS.

Note that questions 1.02 to 1.09 ask information related to the establishment or farm, and is NOT the respondent’s
information as an individual.

For recording the date of interview, the interviewer should follow the instructions present in the data collection form:
two digits for day and month, and four digits for the year. For example, the interview takes place on May 4 th 2018,
the way to record this is:




Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                  92

    5.2. Establishment Characteristics

This section asks for information that will help to characterise the establishment. For example, questions about the
legal status of the establishment, whether it is an agricultural, service or manufactured products business, the
business operations’ starting year etc.

All previous instructions apply to the questions in this section. However, the following require special attention:

Question 2.05: What percentage of this [establishment/farm] is effectively owned by women? (where effective
ownership means having the power to take decisions on the overall management of the establishment).

The interviewer needs to record the percentage (%). This is a proportion, and in general terms it can vary from 0% to
100%. However, this question will only be asked if the answer to Question 2.04 “Does this [establishment/farm] have
any owners who are women?” is “Yes”. Thus, it makes no sense if the recorded information is 0%. In other words, if
there is any information, it should vary between 1% and 100%. IMPORTANT TO TRAIN THIS DURING THE TRAINING.

To record the information, the interviewer writes down a number only (the “%” is already printed in the form ). The
following example shows the proper recording for the answer: “Yes, a woman is owner of the half o f this
establishment”.

                    (2.04)   Does this [establishment/farm] hav e any ow ners w ho are           YES           1
                             w omen?                                                             NO 2 ► 2.06


                    (2.05)   What percentage of this [establishment/farm] is effectiv ely ow ned by w omen?        %
                             (w here effectiv e ow nership means hav ing the pow er to take decisions on the
                             ov erall management of the establishment)

Question 2.06. In the last financial year [insert fiscal or agricultural year], what products or activities are the main
sources of revenue for this establishment?

This question requires the interviewer to pay special attention to the skip pattern. If the answer is “Agriculture,
forestry, and fishing”, then s/he will need to ask Question 2.07. If the answer is “Manufacturing, mining and quarrying,
and other industrial activities”, then s/he will skip Question 2.07 and ask Question 2.08 instead. Any other code leads
you to question 3.01.


    5.3. Workforce

This section asks questions about the workforce at the establishment or farm, including all the employees currently
working at the time of the interview. All the staff include full-time, part-time, and temporary or seasonal workers.
Employees not formally employed, including independent contractors and unpaid employees are included as well.

The workers that are not included are those employed by another enterprise who are assigned to work at the
workplace (outsourced from another firm).

Question 3.10 requires special consideration:

                             [establishment/farm]?

The interviewer is asking about the average number of weeks a seasonal or temporary employees worked during the
last fiscal or agricultural year.

The first concept the interviewer needs to make sure respondents understand is AVERAGE. It is not unusual that some
seasonal or temporary employees will work different numbers of weeks. For instance, a small gift-shop may hire a
temporary shop manager for three weeks prior Christmas, but an extra vendor is needed only during the week
preceding Christmas. Then, one temporary employee will have been working for three weeks, and the vendor just
one. The average number of weeks will be the (sum of the weeks) / (number of temporary employees). In this example:
(3 + 1) / (2) = 4/2 = 2.

In real life, the respondents may not be as clear as the prior example, yet the better the interviewer understands what
information s/he is asking for, the better s/he will be able to support the respondents in providing quality information.
IMPORTANT TO TRAIN THIS DURING THE TRAINING.

Also, it is important to pay attention to the number of weeks. One year is 52 weeks long. By definition, a seasonal or
temporary employee will work only a fraction of the year. Three months will be about 12 to 14 weeks; one month will
only be 4 to 5 weeks; six months will be around 26 weeks. The reason for the small variation in the number of weeks
is because some people think of a month as 4 weeks long, and others count a month as a bit more.

Question 3.02 requires a number (how many permanent full-time employees currently working in this establishment
or farm). If the answer is “None” or “Zero”, the interviewer skips the questions 3.03, 3.03A and 3.03B. If there is at
least one permanent full-time employee working, then no question should be skipped.

For example, the establishment employs six permanent full-time workers. Out of these, two are female, one aged 22
and the other aged 40. The other permanent full-time workers are male. The youngest is 18, and all the others are
aged 25 or more.

    5.4. Establishment Performance

The final section collects information about production and investment in the establishment or farm, including the
total annual sales for the last complete fiscal or agricultural year, the time to get to the closest market where products
can be sold or traded, investments and source of these investments, etc.

For most of the establishments or farms, this is a particularly sensitive information, so it is highly recommended that
the interviewer reassures the respondent about the confidentiality of the information, that identification data will be
removed so that the information cannot be linked to it, that the information will be accessed by the program managers
only, and that the information will never be used for any other purpose than the improvement of the program.

The following questions require a closer look:

Question 4.01:

                    (4.01)    In [fiscal/agricultural] y ear [INSERT LAST COMPLETE          LOCAL CURRENCY UNIT

                              [establishment’s/farm’s] total annual sales?

All the investment figures are to be recorded in Local Currency Units. If the answer is provided in US dollars, Euros, or
any other currency which is not the currency used in the country where the interview takes place, the interviewer will
have to convert the answer into the local currency. IMPORTANT TO TRAIN THIS DURING THE TRAINING.

Question 4.02: This question asks about the total volume produced by the establishment or farm in the last fiscal or
agricultural year. The interviewer first records the Volume Unit and then the amount. For instance, coding the answer
“Ten tons of maize grain”:

                   (4.02)    In [fiscal/agricultural] y ear [INSERT LAST COMPLETE     KGS       1        VOL. UNIT

Question 4.04: This question requires to record one information in two parts. For example, the answer to the question
may be “About six hours”. Record first the Time Unit (in this case, “hours”). Secondly, record the amount of (in this
example) hours.

                                                                                                               TIME UNIT
                    (4.04)    How much time does it take y our [establishment/farm]     DAYS        1
                              to get to the closest market w here products can be       HOURS       2

Question 4.06: Over the last three fiscal years, how much on average was invested in this establishment/farm from
the following investment sources? The amount should be recorded in the local currency unit. The reference period
covers the last three fiscal years.

The second relevant information will require the interviewer to make sure the respondent is referring to the according
source: domestic, international, and establishment or farm’s own revenues or profits. INSERT EXAMPLES OF
DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POSSIBLE SOURCES.

Question 4.05 requires the interviewer to read aloud the sentences, then wait for the respondent to tell her/him
which of the alternatives best represent the practices used at the establishment or farm. It is possible that the
interviewer will have to read aloud the sentences more than once before the respondent makes his/her mind.

The following sections of the data collection form may or may not be included, and will depend on the implementing
firm’s own procedures.



6. Further Aspects to Consider for Paper Based Data Collection
In case of paper based data collection, the supervisor and Data Entry Team should further take into consideration the
following aspects:

  ▪   The supervisor makes sure the interviewer is providing all the expected complete data collection forms – one
      per respondent.
  ▪   The supervisor will review the integrity of the data collection forms. Are all expected data recorded? Is there
      missing information (empty questions where information is expected)? Is there unexpected information
      (information present when question is skipped)?
  ▪   In case of missing information, the interviewer must either complete the form, or provide a satisfactory
      explanation in the form of a comment. For instance, it is possible that the respondent does not have a particular
      information and the interviewer decided not to fill the field by the time of the interview. This information has
      to be validated by the supervisor after re-contacting the respondent. If the situation persists, there is no
      alternative but leaving the question empty. It is important for the Management Team to have a sense of how
      often such a situation occurs for a team or a particular interviewer. If after a while, the trends are systematic,
      the Management Team has to instruct the supervisor on how to proceed.
  ▪   Once the forms are checked, the supervisor will put all the complete and incomplete data collection forms in a
      box, ordered by interviewer.
  ▪   The box has to be labelled with the information of the site, the visit date to the site, team number and code,
      supervisor name and code.
  ▪   Inside the box, an information sheet with information on the box contents’ is included:
         -   Total number of data collection forms;
         -   Total number of complete data collection forms;
         -   Total number of incomplete data collection forms;
         -   Total data collection forms per interviewer;
         -   Total complete data collection forms per interviewer;
         -   Total incomplete data collection forms per interviewer.
      This information is important to keep track of all the contents coming from the field.
  ▪   The box will be sent to the site where the Data Entry Team is recording data. The Data Entry Team receives the
      box by confirming that the content of the box and the information on the information sheet correspond.
  ▪   Every box is assigned to one data entry operator, who is responsible to correctly record the data from all the
      data collection forms in the box. After data entry is complete, all the data collection forms go back in the box.
      Entered data must match the number of forms present in the box.
  ▪   All boxes must be stored in a safe, private and dry room, ready for inspection. It is expected that when an
      external team visits the local project, they can produce in no-time a box, so the databases can be checked
      against the data collection forms. Nothing can be lost in translation!

[NOTE: These Terms of Reference (TOR) are intended to be adapted by World Bank task teams seeking to collect
beneficiary data at the project level. Text may need to be added, amended, or deleted in this TOR template that follows,
based on the project and country context. The type of consultant firm to be recruited for data collection in a given
project and country may also require additional changes to the template below.]


Project Background

The objective of implementing the Jobs data collection forms is to collect data necessary to monitor jobs outcomes in
the results frameworks of WB projects. Jobs outcomes include outcomes related to Job creation, Job quality, and Job
access as well as intermediate outcomes (see Figure 1). The collected data will be used to monitor relevant indicators
that are mapped to each of these jobs outcomes (refer to Annex 1 for a full list of indicators).

Figure 1: Key Outcomes related to Jobs from a view of Job Creation, Job Quality, and Job Access




The data collection forms will track [ALL / A SAMPLE OF – DECISION WILL NEED TO BE DISCUSSED AND APPROVED BY
THE WB CORE TEAM] project beneficiaries. There are two data collection forms for two different types of beneficiaries

– Individual beneficiaries and Firm17 beneficiaries (see Annex 2 and Annex 3). For examples of interventions targeting
various beneficiary types, please refer to Figure 2.
Figure 2: Beneficiaries of Jobs Operations – Individuals and Firms

     Beneficiaries of Jobs Operations are most often at the level of Individuals and Firms. They may be direct
     beneficiaries of projects, or indirect (e.g. through infrastructure).

     Individuals: Interventions targeting individuals or communities generally include beneficiaries as job seekers or to
     improve their employability or earnings. This category includes Labor Programs such as public employment services,
     wage subsidies and public works, as well as interventions promoting sustainable livelihoods and income-generating
     activities. Many interventions, across sectors, aim at enhancing employability though training and capacity building
     among individuals to support workers’ ability to meet skills in demand, particularly in the private sector.
     Firms: Interventions targeting Firms generally provide Firms or entrepreneurs with productive assets such as access to
     finance or securing access to land, in addition to direct investments and technical assistance. Many interventions aim
     at fostering self-employment and small scale entrepreneurship, as well as SME development and upgrading for
     promoting private sector development and jobs.


Depending on the project context, the WB Project Results Framework, and the data requirements for the
monitoring system, and any other data collection efforts planned (e.g. impact evaluation), the forms include select
modules. Table 1 provides an overview of all the modules. Note, however, that not all modules may be needed.

Scope of Work and Tasks

The Consultant firm will be responsible for tasks related to implementation of the Jobs data collection forms among
WB project beneficiaries. These tasks will include but are not limited to:
     ▪       Working with WB task team leader (TTL) and project implementing units (PIUs) to adapt Jobs data collection
             forms as needed to suit project context, in consultation with WB TTL and PIU


17 Firm beneficiaries refer to the entity directly participating in the project intervention. The term “firm” in this toolkit refers to the
establishment. This is because an establishment may be part of a larger firm, but the data collection at the project level must be
supplying numbers about the specific establishment receiving support. If a project seeks data at the establishment level or many
establishments of the same firm, then data must be aggregated for reporting on indicators. Ideally, project results reporting should
be consistent with the Enterprise Survey (ES) methodology. The ES defines ‘firms’ as business organizations composed of one or
more establishments that are specified under common ownership or control; and ‘establishments’ as the physical location where
business is conducted or where services or operations are performed. TTLs may need to adapt the terminology most relevant for
the country, legal, and beneficiary specific context of the project. Further guidance for the PIU and data collection firm is provided
in the Jobs M&E Toolkit: Data Collection Manual for Firm Beneficiaries.

Jobs Data Collection Form Implementation

  ▪   Implementation of the Jobs data collection forms will be carried out by the selected Consultant firm by means
      of face-to-face interviews
  ▪   Duration of survey: from [X TO XX] minutes for the individual beneficiaries form, and from [X TO XX] minutes
      for the Firm beneficiaries form [DURATION DEPENDS ON NUMBER OF DATA COLLECTION QUESTIONS]
  ▪   Number of interviews required: _____ [BLANK TO BE FILLED BY TTLs]
  ▪   The Survey manager should be available continuously throughout the project in order to handle all problems
      that arise during its course. The Survey manager must send reports at least weekly to the designated World
      Bank TTL. The WB task team may contact anyone from the firm involved in the survey at any time, and for
      quality-control purposes. The WB task team may also elect to participate in all stages of the research including
      the actual fieldwork and interviewing
  ▪   The Survey manager must send reports at least weekly to the designated World Bank TTL. A standard template
      for reporting must be used through a cloud-based document, such as Google Drive
  ▪   Each interview will use a single data collection form. However, for convenience the form is internally divided
      into several modules to allow saving time by skipping certain questions for respondents that may not be eligible
      to answer or for whom the questions are not applicable. Note: electronic data collection forms will allow for
      user-friendly use of skip patterns that are automated; paper-based data collection will require careful training
      and ongoing supervision among enumerator teams by the Survey manager

Administrative personnel and interviewer turnover.
It is important that the selected Consultant firm puts in place mechanisms to guarantee low rotation of personnel.
Bidding firms are encouraged to demonstrate in their proposals that they will be able to preserve the core team
throughout the duration of field work.
Knowledge transfer.
In case any person involved in the survey has to be permanently or temporarily replaced during the duration of the
assignment, the Consultant firm should inform the TTL no later than 7 business days after the change and furthermore
ensure sound knowledge transfer and training. In case of replacement of key personnel, i.e., Survey Manager, team
supervisors, IT manager or sub-Consultant the proposed replacement should be approved first by the TTL. If
necessary, the TTL may request re-training of the Consultant firm’s staff involved in the project. All s taff that have
missed the initial training seminar should be trained using materials approved by the TTL, and evidence of such
training should be presented to the TTL.


Translation of Jobs Data Collection Forms

The Consultant firm is required to translate all Jobs data collection forms and supporting implementation materials into
[INSERT LOCAL LANGUAGE(S)] as required by the TTLs. The final Jobs data collection forms in each language, including
its layout as it will be implemented in the field work, must be approved by the TTL.
The Consultant firm will also be responsible for translating into local language(s) the Data Collection Manuals, and
other material for the training (if required). The Data Collection Manual is a useful tool for enumerators and
supervisors in the implementation of the interviews. The Consultant should hire a third party to back-translate the
questionnaires into English; the person performing the back-translation must do so without knowledge of the original
English version. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the original concepts are preserved and to detect

potential variations in the understanding of questions emerging from language problems. The back-translation must
be provided to the TTL for verification, and the WB technical staff and TTL will discuss with the Consultant firm any
changes required after this verification. The final Jobs data collection forms in each language, including its layout as it
will be implemented in the field work, must be approved by the TTL.


Format of Data Collection Forms

The TTL will deliver all data collection forms to the Consultant firm. It is intended that before beginning the work, all
parties, including the Consultant firm, should be confident that the forms will achieve the objectives and be feasible
within the budget provided for the data collection forms. The final formatted forms will be delivered by the TTL to the
Consultant firm ready for translation, with all required formatting, coding scheme, and appropriate skip logic/patterns.
The final format of the forms as they will be used in the actual interviews will have to be authorized by the TTL.


Supervisor and Enumerator Selection and Training

The Team Supervisors should have previous survey experience and should be available throughout the entire duration
of the field work. Supervisors must have a minimum of a university degree. In case data collection form is implemented
electronically, electronic literacy is required for the enumerators.
Enumerators should have at least high school education. In case data collection form is implemented electronically,
electronic literacy is required for the enumerators.
The Consultant firm should train at least 20 percent more interviewers than will be required, so that the best interviewers
can be retained after training as well as to replace interviewers who drop out during the actual fieldwork and
interviewing. In case the training has finished more than one week before interviewers that replace other interviewers
who dropped out, a refresher training needs to be conducted.
The Consultant firm must have a well-developed plan to thoroughly train their team supervisors, enumerators and the
data entry staff on the forms and the survey procedures. All team supervisors and enumerators are expected to read,
study, and understand the Data Collection Manual for the forms they will work on.
The Consultant firm should conduct the training of the interviewers. The training should last a minimum of [TWO DAYS]
and should include explanations of all questions, role-playing of enumerator and actor-respondents, at least two
interviews with real participants, and a test at the end.
Fieldwork should start within four days from the completion of supervisor/ enumerator training.
The Consultant firm is expected to use the Data Collection Manual as a guide to preparing presentations to be used
during training. The WBG will provide a standard template for training slides that may be adapted as needed to specific
contexts based on project requirements.
All enumerators and supervisors will be paid for participating in the training. Interviewers not chosen from training but
who have achieved a minimum level can be considered on a reserve list in case of interviewers dropping out during the
fieldwork time. The WB task team may also choose to exclude any enumerators or supervisor from further participation
at any time without specifying the reasons.
The list of enumerators and supervisors, including name, mobile phone numbers, and email address, will be provided to
the WB at the end of the training and the WB may contact them at any time.
Piloting
Immediately after the Training of Trainers training and before the surveys are launched, the Consultant firm must pilot
the questionnaires on a selection of [10-15] beneficiaries (in case both individual and firm beneficiaries are surveyed, at
least 5 beneficiaries of each beneficiary type need to be included). The head trainer and the survey manager have to be
part of the pilot. The pilot will also be used to test the data entry system. The Consultant firm must immediately report
any issues that arise as a result of piloting to the TTL.



Version 1  June 2017                                                                                                 101
The piloting procedures may include but are not limited to the following:
  ▪    Drafting and adapting the data collection form;
  ▪    Enumerator training on the pilot version of the data collection form and pilot testing protocols with sample
       beneficiaries;
  ▪    Revising the draft data collection form to develop the final version for field use and related field manual;
  ▪    Enumerators’ training led by the pilot testing core team.

The pilots (or pretests) are essential for examining the following sets of issues:
  ▪    the translation is appropriately phrased for the local environment;
  ▪    indications that some questions are misunderstood, answered incorrectly because of ambiguities, or not
       answered at all because of lack of information or resentment;
  ▪    how well the data entry system works, including range checking and consistency checking

The pilot will provide useful feedback on length of interview, strategies for approaching beneficiaries, and will inform the
content of the interviewer-training program. It is expected that the Consultant firm will work in close collaboration with
the WB team in identifying areas that may require fine-tuning (translation, adapting questions to country context while
ensuring comparability with other countries, etc.).
Associated adjustments to the implementation manual and training program for interviewers and field operators will be
made upon completion of the adjustments to the instruments. The Consultant firm will be expected to update the
training accordingly using the adjusted questionnaire and implementation materials.
All modifications to the Jobs data collection forms, instructions [AND SAMPLING STRUCTURE] that may be suggested
from the piloting results must be approved by the TTL before the data collection forms are implemented. Data
collection may not be launched until the Jobs data collection forms are finalized and approved by the TTL. Any changes
to the format or ordering of the data collection forms to facilitate implementation must be cleared with the TTL and
fully documented.


Interviewing

The Jobs data collection forms may be implemented after piloting and enumerator training are completed and after the
final data collection forms have been approved by the TTL. Data collection will be administered through face-to-face
interviews.
Fieldwork and interview completion is determined by the TTL by taking into consideration the number of completed
interviews and the quality and comprehensiveness of the data gathered from these interviews. For a survey to be
complete, the large majority of the relevant information must be obtained and entered into the data base. No questions
should be left blank except the ones skipped due to correctly applied skip patterns. The integrity and accuracy of the
data are vital. The Consultant firm will establish procedures to check the quality of the interviews.
The duties of the enumerator will be: to visit beneficiaries and ensure their participation; to conduct face-to-face
interviews with the selected respondents; to accurately record respondents’ answers; to code the questionnaires
accordingly; to ensure completeness and accuracy of answers; to perform accuracy checks on the questionnaires; to
ensure security and confidentiality of the collected information and the completed questionnaires; to deliver completed
questionnaires to supervisors; to respond to other needs related to the field work as assigned from time to time.
The duties of the supervisors will be: to supervise all activities of their assigned enumerators and to monitor their
activities during the data collection process; to assess the quality of the work of the enumerators and the quality of the
data from the completed questionnaire; to approve questionnaires for data entry ensuring that the assigned
enumerators did not overlook inconsistencies and skip patterns; to provide all logistical support and material to
enumerators; to provide feedback to enumerators on quality assurance and methodology requirements.
A survey manager will oversee the fieldwork. The duties of the survey manager will be: to supervise all activities of
supervisors and enumerators; to assign beneficiaries to be surveyed to supervisors and enumerators; to assist the team

to ensure maximum participation and minimize non response; to coordinate with supervisors the quality control of the
data collection process; and to ensure that the data entry is carried out efficiently and in an environment that minimizes
human error. Further, the survey manager is in charge of organizing a meeting with all supervisors and interviewers after
the first day of data collection in order to discuss eventual problems that were encountered during data collection and
to ensure consistency.


Sub-contracting

Bidders intending to sub-contract to local firms must present the names and references of all the proposed sub-
Consultants. The [WBG] reserves the right of approving each sub-Consultant. Any change of the sub-Consultants must
be confirmed by the TTL in advance. Bidders are encouraged to include sufficient information on the sub-Consultants
for the selection committee to decide on their ability to carry out the survey in each country. Bidders must be able to
accommodate alternative sub-Consultants whenever the TTL and the conditions of the country determine it to be
necessary.


Data entry

Data entry will take place concurrently with the data collection. This allows the Survey Manager to identify any
inconsistencies in how questions are being asked and interpreted or other errors before the survey is completed. Data
will be entered into a database using a data entry program, approved by the TTL that automatically checks for logical
consistency and skip patterns and non-eligible or out-of-range variables. The Consultant firm must check for the presence
of outliers according to procedures supplied by the TTL. The Consultant firm will flag the outliers and re-check the
information with the appropriate beneficiaries. All values in the survey that are 0 will be entered as 0 and not left blank.
If the interviewee responds “don’t know” the answer will be coded as -9 and not left blank. Refusals to respond will be
coded as -8, and not applicable will be coded as -7. Other special codes for specific questions will be authorized by the
TTL. Acceptable values for each question of the questionnaire are specified in the Data Collection Manual and will be
made available to the Consultant firm. The only acceptable blanks in the final data set are those generated by skip
patterns.
The Consultant firm will provide the collected data at any time following a request by the TTL and at three predefined
stages during the data gathering/entry process for consistency check and quality control. The first set will be delivered
after ten percent (10%) of the total number of interviews have been completed and entered into a data base. The second
set will be delivered after fifty percent (50%) of the total number of interviews has been completed. The final set will be
delivered after completion of one hundred percent (100%) of the interviews. Each delivery should include translated and
verified values for string variables to enable [WBG] review.
The TTL may request more frequent data updates in addition to the three main deliveries. The [WBG] will check the data
and provide feedback to the Consultant on any errors or inconsistencies.


Deliverables

The Consultant firm:
  a.) Will translate from English into the local language/context: the data collection forms and all related survey
      materials. The Consultant firm will provide the TTL with a copy of each translated document.
  b.) Will have the translated data collection forms back-translated into English by someone who has not seen and
      has no knowledge of the wording in the English forms.
  c.) Will seek approval for the final translated data collection forms from the TTL prior to launching the surveys.
  d.) Will provide both English and local language versions of the data collection forms with the variable names used
      for data entry written down next to the appropriate question prior to launching the surveys.

          them as per instructions provided by the TTL.
  m.) Will clean the data if needed after data entry, only after verification of the process with the TTL.
  n.) Will provide the [WBG] with a clean labelled database comprised of a total of all completed interviews in
      separate database files. The database will be in the STATA or SPSS electronic database format. The database
      will contain all variables included in the questionnaires, following the codes included in them.
  o.) Will provide the [WBG] with a second database including the location information of each interviewed
      beneficiary: name, address, GPS coordinates, phone number, fax number, email/web address, name of the
      person interviewed [for Firms: position title of the interviewee in the firm].


Confidentiality and data ownership

All data is confidential and the property of the [WBG]. Its sole purpose is to support the tracking of project performance
and is not for commercial use. No data or other information from this survey will be released to third parties without the
written approval of the [WBG]. The Consultant firm will turn over all data, data collection forms and other material to
the [WBG] and will not retain any information or material after the survey data collection has ended.
