Foreword

           The World Bank’s goals are to eradicate extreme poverty, and boost shared
           prosperity in a sustainable manner. On the African continent, poverty
           reduction, economic development, and sustainability are deeply intertwined
           and dependent on the management of natural resources—such as land,
           water, forest, aquatic resources, and biodiversity—which provide the basis
           for livelihoods and economic sectors. These resources, however, are highly
           vulnerable and under stress due to climatic factors, population growth,
           and poor management practices. Nearly half of Africa’s population live
           in ecologically sensitive drylands, and, as a result of frequent and severe
           shocks, especially droughts, the future promises to be even more challenging.
           Population growth and expansion of drylands due to climate change could
           increase the number of people living in a challenging environment by up to
           70 percent by 2030, according to our recent report on Confronting Drought in
           Africa’s Drylands: Opportunities for Enhancing Resilience.

           African countries recognize the need for bold vision, strong commitment, and
           impactful action on the ground. The Great Green Wall Initiative, the African
           Resilient Landscape Initiative (ARLI), the African Forest Landscape Restoration
           (AFR100), the African Landscapes Action Plan (ALAP), and others create solid
           foundations for action. Communities, political leaders, and the private sector
           are taking action to restore and protect Africa’s precious natural resources.
           There are many inspiring successes already.

           The World Bank has been supporting African countries’ efforts to
           sustainably manage their natural resources, combat desertification and land
           degradation, protect valuable resources, and build resilient landscapes. This
           brochure presents examples, highlights lesson learned, and identifies future
           opportunities.

           Transformative change will require deepened commitments, even more
           effective programs, coordinated financial support, and innovative regional
           and international partnerships. Together we can make Africa’s landscapes
           productive and resilient.

     populations have increased and

Single-sector approaches, isolated
projects, and individual institutions
cannot sufficiently address the
multidisciplinary challenges posed
by land degradation and climate
change. Overall, it is estimated
that improved natural resource
management, along with better
livestock management, expanded
irrigation, and better management
of rain-fed agriculture can cut in
half (or more in some countries) the
increase in the number of drought-
affected people over the next decade

share knowledge, make domestic
and international financing more
efficient, and ultimately, strengthen
the ability of land users to individually
and collectively reduce intertwined
land degradation and climate
risks. Creating resilient landscapes
that strengthen the integrity of
ecosystems to provide the full range
of services for productive sectors
and livelihoods, including migrant
and fragile communities, requires
collaborative action at scale. It also
requires coordination of planning
and management decisions across
a range of sectors and stakeholders,
supportive policies and regulations,
investments in effective programs,
capacity building to generate learning,
replication of good practices, and

      Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI)
      The GGWI is an African Union program launched in 2007 to
      strengthen the resilience of the region's people and natural
      systems from Senegal to Eritrea. Endorsed by African heads of
      state and government, it aims to tackle the detrimental social,
      economic, and environmental impacts of land degradation and
      desertification in the region. The GGWI has a bold ambition
      to “green” Africa from Senegal to Djibouti, restoring degraded
      lands and transforming local livelihoods. Once completed, the
      metaphorical “wall” will be one of the largest environmental
      accomplishments in human history. At the UNFCCC COP 21 (2015
      Paris Climate Conference), the World Bank announced its intention
      to scale-up its support to the Great Green Wall Initiative with an
      additional US$1.9 billion investment.

Box 3: The African Resilient Landscapes Initiative
The African Resilient Landscapes Initiative (ARLI) was launched by the African Union NEPAD Agency in December
2015. It calls for the use of the landscape approach to integrate multiple sectoral initiatives and facilitate linkages
and coordination among them. ARLI is mobilizing financial and technical resources from multiple sources to help
design and implement operations at landscape level. Through ARLI, the World Bank supports resilient landscapes in
the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and East Africa. ARLI commits, through the implementation of the African Landscape
Action Plan (ALAP) and the African Forest and Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), to bring 100 million
hectares of degraded and deforested land under restoration in Africa by 2030. By doing so, the ARLI is contributing
to improve soil fertility and food security, access to clean water, combat desertification, increase biodiversity and
habitat, create green jobs, bolster economic growth and livelihood diversification, and increase the capacity for
climate change resilience and adaptation.

       The ARLI will mobilize African countries and partners to leverage sectorial interventions and collectively ensure the
       integrity, resilience, restoration and sustainable management of landscapes across regions.

  Box 4. Ghana Sustainable Land and Water Management Project (SLWMP):
  Programmatic Approach, Integrated Solutions, and Transformational Changes
  Since 2009, Ghana has been implementing a programmatic series of projects through three phases of investments.
  Through these projects, the country moved from a sole focus on farmland management to sustainable land
  and water management, then to integrated landscape management to support resilience and food security. This
  strategic long-term engagement is resulting in visible on-the-ground impacts, improved livelihoods, and multiple
  ecosystems benefits. The project design combined a package of soft and hard investments and community-level
  interventions, focusing on the maintenance of ecological and flood infrastructure. Emphasis has been placed
  on innovation, experimentation in incentives, and extension systems. Sustainability is realized through support
  to postharvest management improvements and a focus on value chain and nondestructive uses of forests.
  Multisectoral collaboration and a decentralized implementation mechanism allowed traditional authorities,
  women, and youth to participate in the decision making and land-use planning. Innovative financing enables
  farmers to receive upfront support followed by a series of performance-based payments based on the incremental
  environmental benefits generated by SLWM technology. The SLWMP is financed by US$30 million in GEF grants
  and Ghana’s in-kind contribution. equivalent to US$14 million. It is one of the 12 country investments part of the

       Box 5. Landless Youth for Resilient Landscapes in Ethiopia
       Land rights, management, value, and use form key development issues for millions of rural Ethiopians facing climate,
       water, food, and livelihood insecurity. This is especially true for youth facing severe challenges of landlessness and
       joblessness. This innovative approach provided legal landholding certificates and extension support to landless
       youth in exchange for restoring degraded communal lands. This resulted in youth employment, increased
       livelihood opportunities, empowered youths who have few other options but to migrate, and strengthened
       the basis for more citizen engagement and better participation in the governance of natural resources. It also
       helped diversify and balance competing land uses in rural landscapes and boost climate resilience in productive
       landscapes.As of December 2016, over 740 youth groups with more than 15,000 members (40 percent female)
       have received group landholding certificates or other legal documentation. About 100,000 landless youth could
       be reached with sufficient financing that would complement the US$100 million of World Bank financing planned
       for approval in July 2018. This initiative is part of the World Bank–financed Ethiopia Sustainable Land Management
       Project II (SLMP 2), one of the 12 country investments comprising the World Bank/GEF–funded SAWAP in support
       of Africa’s Great Green Wall Initiative.

  In 2016, linked to Ethiopia’s Oromia Forested Landscape Program, the BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable
  Forest Landscapes, the World Bank Group’s IFC, the international coffee company Nespresso, and the nonprofit
  TechnoServe launched a collaboration project to support coffee farmers in Ethiopia. The goal is to support climate-
  smart coffee production and help increase the productivity of high-quality coffee in Oromia. This entails making
  77 wet mills comply with standards under the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program™ (AAA) and training
  20,000 farmers to convert 9,540 hectares of traditional coffee production to AAA standards. This is supported with
  a US$3 million grant to the Nespresso Sustainability Innovation Fund to provide farmers with intensive, field-based
  agronomy and business training to advance sustainable coffee production, and an additional a US$3 million loan
  to Nespresso to increase shade tree planting within coffee farms and enhance wet mill processing.

  In Zambia, discussions have been initiated with several cotton companies to create a collective partnership to
  produce zero-deforestation cotton as part of COMPACI certification. The Bank’s BioCarbon Fund sponsored a
  technical study of the cotton sector to understand how zero-deforestation cotton schemes can be successful,
  including the types of operational activities and corporate policies that would need to be supported. This study is
  complete and is now serving as a basis for engaging cotton companies and other agribusiness. In addition, several

     CONCLUSION
     The importance of sub-Saharan Africa drylands and the scale of the
     challenges that they face now and in the years to come call for shifting
     away from a business-as-usual mode. In fact, there is a range of proven
     and well-documented interventions in key sectors that can be scaled up
     and implemented while remaining within reach of the national budgets and
     development aid. Fighting against land degradation at landscape scale is
     key not only to meeting these challenges toward improved resilience, food
     security, and stability—it can also generate significant economic, social, and
     environmental benefits for the populations of these regions as well as beyond.

     Implementing this agenda effectively will require a number of key ingredients
     from the respective countries and their partners such as:
         relying on robust analysis and tools, as well as experience sharing, to
      •	 
         provide guidance to decision makers at different levels, including policy
         makers, planners, and land users;
         promoting integrated solutions that take advantage of landscape
      •	 
         approaches and experience;
         mobilizing and channeling financing at scale and from a combination of

         promoting partnerships to take full advantage of synergies, relative
      •	 
         strengths, and knowledge.

     Building on the experience and expertise it has accumulated in these areas,
     the recognized support systems it has developed, and the teams and partners
     it can mobilize across sectors, the World Bank will continue to support
     sub-Saharan African countries to meet their ambitions. Interventions’
     designs will identify future drivers of vulnerability and recommend cross-
     border solutions that curb poverty, migration, and displacement. Further
     support, tailored to countries’ respective needs, should build on African
     countries’ own experiences and learning processes and focus on designing
     and improving systems and interventions that promote these integrated
     approaches in practice.

Desertification is not Fate
Blog by Magda Lovei on Nazikiliza, I am Listening – World Bank Blog

In East Africa and West Africa, about 300 million people living in dryland areas rely on natural, resource-based activities
for their livelihood. By 2030, this number could increase to 540 million. At the same time, climate change could result in an
expansion of Africa’s drylands by as much as 20%.

The degradation of land, water, and forests transcends institutional and geographic boundaries. So do recurrent droughts and
floods. They compel us to increase our commitment to the sustainable use of natural resources, to climate change adaptation
and mitigation, and to improving food security and water security.
 
Business as usual is definitely not a viable option when it comes to the drylands. Instead, there is a need for natural resource-
based interventions, such as landscape restoration and sustainable management, complemented by better safety nets,
contingent finance mechanisms, and alternative livelihoods.
 
African countries are now reconfirming commitments and targets to achieve these, and jointly mobilizing resources for the
large-scale restoration of Africa’s landscapes.

I recently returned from Ghana where I attended a conference including representatives of 12 countries, participants in
the Sahel and West Africa Program (SAWAP), a $1.1 billion program funded by the World Bank, GEF, and others under the
TerrAfrica partnership to support the African Union’s Great Green Wall initiative—a continental vision to halt desertification
and land degradation.
 
Teams from Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, and Togo reviewed
their progress, shared their experience, and discussed future opportunities for landscape restoration. Many successes,
innovations, and inspiring results across the continent were cited. They are making us believe that desertification is not our
fate.

Through the SAWAP, as many as 5,894 institutions across the continent have increased their adaptive capacity and as many
as 14.9 million direct beneficiaries have been reached. These commitments motivate us to do more.

In Ethiopia, where large-scale landscape rehabilitation is already a reality, the provision of legal landholding certificates and
extension support to formerly landless youth—in exchange for restoring degraded communal lands—represents a successful
innovation. It has resulted in employment, more livelihood opportunities, the empowerment of youth, and an alternative
to migration. It has also helped diversify and balance competing land uses and boosting climate resilience in productive
landscapes. Over 740 youth groups with more than 15,000 members, 40 percent of them female, have benefited. About
100,000 landless youth could be reached with the right financing.
 
In Ghana, a programmatic series of Bank projects has evolved through three phases of sustainable land management, each
one expanding the reach and scope of intervention. This programmatic series of Bank projects has focused on connecting
fragmented habitats in protected areas, forest reserves, woodlands, agroforestry land, rangelands and croplands.
So far, it has supported over 14,000 land users who adopted conservation measures in 150 communities.

In Burkina Faso, the Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management Project has pioneered the concept of biodiversity in
productive landscapes in 180 villages. It has created and catalyzed community dynamics for the sustainable management of
natural resources at the micro-watershed level by implementing incentives, creating an investment framework, and rewarding
individual and collective know-how.

More momentum needed
What emerged from the SAWAP meeting is that much more must be done to sustain the momentum, scale up successes,
and face challenges emerging from the impact of climate change. The World Bank is fast-tracking support to the continent’s
resilience under the Africa Climate Business Plan. Investment in climate-resilient landscapes is one of the key pillars of the
plan, committing to mobilize $755 million for such measures by 2024.

With a continental vision, strong commitment, broad partnerships, and commensurate financing, transformation of Africa’s
drylands is possible. We know we cannot transform livelihoods without restoring landscapes and building the resilience of the
ecosystems upon which the people depend on for their food, water, and security.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, UNCCD’s aspiration for a Land Degradation
Neutral world, the Africa Resilient Landscape initiative, the  African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, and the
Windhoek Declaration on drought all remind us that collaborative action is our only chance for success.
