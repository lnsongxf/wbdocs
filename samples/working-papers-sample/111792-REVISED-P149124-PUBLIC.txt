     BOX 3  The Comité National Routier

     The mission of the CNR is to:
         •	 Participate in the economic monitoring and follow-up of the market of Common Carriers especially by means
            of cost analysis, and circulate the information it gathers as well as the economic analyses it carries out.
         •	 Carry out research and socioeconomical surveys related to the carriage of goods market, which are useful to all
            of the transport professionals.
         •	 Finalize and circulate management tools for the benefit of the haulers.
         •	 Carry out all missions of general interest to the trade.
     The Tasks
         •	 The CNR is a technical organization and think thank whose prime mission lies in the observation of the
            working methods of road haulage of goods markets, whose field of action has steadily increased from the sole
            domestic carriage under the French flag to all transport operations carried out within Europe.
         •	 Within the scope of the general interest mission, it is entrusted with by the State to both inform and alert the
            economical spheres and the transport ministry about the observed evolutions.
         •	 Its work is mainly dedicated to companies. Particular attention is paid to small and micro businesses, especially
            with regard to the observation of the evolution of operations conditions and cost components.
         •	 From the collected data, the CNR reorganizes reference costings for haulage operations and issues indexes
            which can be used in free negotiations. In this capacity, CNR produces public statistics. This mission is carried
            out under the aegis of a scientific council that is independent from the trade, which today is chaired by a
            university professor and made up of several INSEE directors. The scientific council certifies methodologies and
            guarantees objective results.
         •	 CNR circulates reference indicators needed in the indexation mechanism for the diesel fuel indexation system
            (Articles L3222—1 and 2 of the Transport Code) and promotes fair tariff adjustment practices.
         •	 It develops calculation and even management tools that aim to help the companies compute their costs in a
            more accurate manner. These tools are freely available on CNR’s website.
         •	 CNR carries out economic analyses, either on its own initiative or upon request of the transport line ministry
            (e.g., on the impact of the latest regulations or projected developments).
         •	 In the international field, monograph surveys are carried out concerning the nationality of common carriers in
            the main competitor countries in the EU.
     The Board of Directors
     The CNR is managed by a board of directors composed of twenty-one members appointed by decree of the line minister
     for Transport: a) fourteen members appointed on the proposal of the professional organizations representing both
     Common Carriers and freight forwarders, namely, Fédération Nationale des Transports Routiers (FNTR), Organisation
     des Transporteurs Routiers Européens (OTRE), Fédération des entreprises de Transport et Logistique de France (TLF)
     and Union Nationale des Organisations Syndicales des Transporteurs Routiers Automobiles (UNOSTRA) and b) seven
     qualified persons appointed by the transport line minister.
     The Scientific Council
     A scientific council operates in conjunction with the board of directors. It approves the methodologies put forward for
     economic observation and is consulted about the survey programs presented by the board of directors. The scientific
     council is composed of six members, four chosen by the transport line minister and two appointed by the board of
     directors.

 Mechanism        Renting vehicles with or without driver.
                  Lease vehicles for a certain duration. In that case the lessor will exclusively use the vehicles and be

                  road transport operator. The authorization to operate usually takes the form of a registration with the
                  competent administrative structure, which is in charge of verifying the compliance with the criteria. The

 Services         Transporting/moving the goods remitted to the carrier from the agreed point of loading/origin to the
                  agreed point of unloading/destination, by providing a vehicle and a driver that are fit for the given
                  operation. However, it is common that this basic task is complemented by additional services ancillary to
                  transport and which are generally part of the transport contract. The ancillary services provided usually
                  by the driver or transport operator staff are: loading, unloading, stowing and securing the cargo, filling in
                  transport documents and accomplishing certain customs formalities in relation with transport, as well as
                  return of load support or pallets.
 Logistic         In addition to the ancillary services, the carrier may accept to carry out some logistics services that are
 Services         usually not considered as part of the transport contract but are subject to normal commercial law. These
                  additional logistics services may consist of forwarding activities (organization of door-to-door transport
                  via intermodal solutions), packaging, collecting and grouping loads, warehousing.
 Contractual      In general and as a rule the transport of goods is subject to the filling in and signing of a document,
 Aspects and      which sets the conditions of the transport including liabilities. However, depending on the local culture
 Liability        and tradition, in some parts of the world the transport contract is often concluded verbally and without
                  formalities.
                  The legal nature of the transport contract is either a normal commercial one or a special contract subject
                  to specific rules. When the transport contract is a standard commercial one, the carrier/ transport
                  operator is not subject to a special liability regime, but is liable according to standard commercial/
                  contractual laws applicable. When a special legal regime is the basis of the transport contract, it implies
                  some particularities such as:
                       •	 The carrier is bound by an obligation of result and is therefore considered as automatically liable for
                          any damage, loss or delay unless proven that it is due to a limited list of situations. The level of this
                          legal presumption varies between countries and international instruments applicable.
                       •	 The counterpart of this strong presumption is that the indemnity due by the carrier in case of dam-
                          age, loss or delay is limited to a lump sum compensation that may be calculated on the basis of an
                          indemnity by weight unit (kg) or by load unit.
                       •	 In case of severe fault by the carrier, the limitation may be excluded.
 Transport        In general, any transport operation must be subject to the filling in and signing of an accompanying
 Document         document, a Consignment Note (CN) or transport document, which may have several functions. On the
                  one hand it will attest to the nature and quantity of the goods transported, their condition when they were
                  taken into charge by the carrier through signing by the carrier and sender/shipper; the document will also
                  attest the delivery to the consignee. But the Consignment Note is also useful for control purposes en route
                  and may serve as a statistical tool. In this latter case a copy of the CN must be sent or communicated for
                  statistical purposes to the designated authority.

 Commercial
 Vehicles Renters                                                 Characteristics
 Their role is to rent commercial vehicles to professional transport operators or to industrialists (own account transport)
 with or without drivers.
 Type of                 The undertaking can be a Natural Person (individual owner) or a Legal Person (entity/
 Undertaking             undertaking/company registered according to national commercial law).
 Type of Operating       Usually the renters own the vehicles and are the employers of the drivers they offer to their clients.
 Mechanism
 Regulatory              In some countries, the usual obligation of registering as a commercial entity/activity is sufficient.
 Framework               However in other countries (like in some countries of the EU) the registration to a dedicated
                         register is needed for the activity of renting a vehicle without a driver.
                         As far as renting vehicles with drivers is concerned, rules similar to those for access to the
                         profession of road transport operator are applicable to renters (registration and compliance with
                         minimum conditions and requirements for access to the profession/occupation).
 Renting Services        In case of renting without drivers, the service consists in providing to the client the vehicle(s)
                         he needs. The client is responsible for the vehicle’s conformity to legal, security and technical
                         requirements as well as to sanitary and customs regulations as appropriate.
                         In case of renting with drivers, in addition to the vehicle(s) as above, the renters must provide
                         professional drivers holding appropriate driving licences and supplementary certified driver and
                         vehicle qualification as appropriate (e.g., CPC, dangerous goods, perishable foodstuff).
 Contractual Aspects     For simple vehicle renting, a contract shall be signed and as a rule a copy of it should be on board
 and Liability           the vehicle. The renter should provide basic third-party liability insurance to cover damages caused
                         by the vehicles. However the client/transport operator is responsible for additional insurance, e.g.,
                         for traffic crash or for own commercial liability.
                         In case of renting with drivers, a more complex contract must be signed, a copy of which must
                         be on board. The renter with driver is liable for damage caused by the rented vehicle in case of
                         default of the vehicle. He is also liable for damage produced in incidents or accidents caused by the
                         driver during his driving. However, it is generally the client/transport operator who is considered
                         responsible for the driver’s acts undertaken outside the driving activity (such as loading/unloading).

 Freight
 Forwarders                                                       Characteristics
 By definition forwarders are transport organizers and logistics services providers.
 Type of              The undertaking can be a Natural Person (individual) or a Legal Person (entity/undertaking/
 Undertakings         company registered according to national commercial law).
 Type of              The forwarder provides immaterial and material services. In some countries forwarders are allowed to

 Mechanism            operators. In countries where both professions are regulated, they must comply with both access
                      criteria and conditions.
 Regulatory           In addition to the usual obligation of registering as a commercial entity/activity specific rules may
 Framework            apply. However, in most regions of the world this profession is not regulated.
                      In regions and countries where the forwarding activity is regulated, the conditions to access the
                      profession are usually very simple and consist in a registration to a dedicated register held in general
                      by the line ministry for transport.
                      However, in some countries like in France a registered transport company is allowed to perform
                      forwarding services by subcontracting a part of its transport to another transport operator if this
                      activity counts for less than 15% of its turnover. If it is above 15% of the turnover, then the transport
                      company should in addition also register as a forwarding company.
                      Self-regulation of the profession has been developed by FIATA to certify the level of professional
                      competence of forwarders; however it is not a mandatory requirement to access the profession even if
                      some clients may impose on their forwarders to be holders of such certificates.
 Forwarding           Basically the services provided by freight forwarders consist at least of organizing the transport of
 Services             goods for and on behalf of their clients, by selecting the mode of transport, the carrier(s) and other
                      modalities. Most commonly they are involved in the organization of intermodal and multimodal
                      transport services but also undertake to provide or organize other logistics services.
 Contractual          There is no international legal norm that defines the legal status and liability of the forwarder,
 Aspects and          contrary to what exists for road carriers (defined by the CMR Convention for example). Therefore,
 Liability            it is usually admitted that forwarders are operating depending on national law applicable under two
                      different types of contracts and liability regimes.
                      In Anglo-Saxon countries, forwarders are considered as simple intermediaries whose task is to put in
                      contact a client and a transport operator. They act as a kind of representative of the client but they
                      do not contract on their own, they always act on behalf of their clients, for example when signing a
                      transport contract. In that case, their liability is usually professional liability, they are liable only for
                      their personal faults or breaches, and they are not responsible for the good accomplishment of the
                      transport nor for the good state of the goods at destination. They act according to an obligation of
                      means but not according to an obligation of result like the carrier.
                      In many Latin American countries, forwarders are considered to be operating under an obligation
                      of result, meaning that they are responsible for the good accomplishment of the transport and the
                      good state of the goods at destination. This regime is known as ‘Commissionaire.” In practice they
                      are liable for both their own and their subcontractors’ fault. Under this liability regime, they can
                      contract on their own name with transport operators. In this case, they act as the sender towards the
                      transport operator. For the client it is a real simplification as their only counterpart is the forwarder
                      (Commissionaire) and not a multitude of operators.
 Forwarding           In general, forwarders produce a door-to-door transport document, called a Bill of Lading, for the
 Documents            client. The FIATA model of a Bill of Lading is widely used throughout the world.

   BOX 4  Romania’s Organization of Transport

   In Romania, a member State of the European Union, the Ministry of Transport (MoT) has a dual role of specialized
   body and State authority for transport. As transport specialized body, some of MoT’s main responsibilities are to:
       •	 elaborate and implement strategies, policies and development programs;
       •	 organize and finance activities in relation to the collection of transport statistical and other documentary data;
       •	 ensure users’ rights to choose freely the mode, the operator and the mean of transport;
       •	 support the development of public, multimodal and combined transport;
       •	 stimulate initiative and ensure transport operators’ autonomy;
       •	 concession transport assets belonging to the State, on behalf of the latter.
       As State transport authority, the MoT has implementation, inspection and enforcement attributions that are exerted
   through specialized bodies, to which MoT delegated some of its competencies. One of them, the Romanian Road
   Authority is a technical body responsible for:
       •	 licensing road transport operators and economic agents performing activities that are ancillary to road transport
          (e.g., terminals);
       •	 route licensing for operators performing regular or special transport of passenger transport;
       •	 certifying enterprises that perform own-account transport operations;
       •	 authorizing driving schools and instructors/trainers;
       •	 registering and keeping records of road transport operators, own-account transport companies, and safety
          advisors;
       •	 issuing certificates of professional competence for road transport personnel;
       •	 implementing road transport technical norms and regulations;
       •	 managing road safety audits including the training of road safety auditors;
       •	 acting as Secretariat for the Interministerial Road Safety Council.
        This structure is also represented at the local level in each of the administrative divisions of the country.
        Another entity, the State Inspection for Road Transport Control is a technical body responsible for controlling the
   transport operators and their vehicles and drivers for compliance with the national and international requirements in
   areas regulated by the Road Authority.
        Finally, the Romanian Automotive Register is the technical specialized body designated by the Ministry of Transport
   as a competent authority in the field of road vehicles, road safety, environment protection and quality assurance, with the
   following main responsibilities:
       •	 to grant the national type, individual approvals and certificates of conformity (as applicable) for the road
          vehicles, and their systems, parts and separate technical entities;
       •	 to perform the periodical technical inspection for certain categories of motor vehicles;
       •	 to license the technical inspection stations and to check the periodical technical inspection activity;
       •	 to license the workshops performing the works of mounting, adjustment and checking the vehicles and their
          components;
       •	 to certify the quality management system.

   BOX 6  Self-Regulation in South Africa

   In the past, access to road freight markets across the main districts in South Africa was restricted on geographical
   grounds. For the last few decades, as from the early 1990s, access to the occupation of road transport operators and
   to freight markets has been inadequately regulated; many of the existing regulations are ignored in daily operations,
   because enforcement as a whole is rather low. In this unregulated environment no further deregulation was really needed.
        Currently, large companies are well run and competition is fierce. In general, margins are very tight with dire
   consequences, and not just for the small operators. In respect of access to the occupation, there are no specific regulations
   over and above those governing the establishment of a company in any other economic sector. There is no quantitative
   restriction on either the number of companies that can operate in the country, or the size of their vehicle fleet, or the
   number of drivers and other staff employed. There are no obligations concerning company premises; many operators
   who have a truck or a tractor and trailer combination keep them at home.
        There are several opportunities to study road transport operations (university or college) but there are no mandatory
   conditions for becoming a transport manager and implicitly no special requirements regarding the transport manager’s
   qualifications, training and examination conditions.
        The situation is similar regarding the requirement for managers and companies to enjoy good reputation. There is
   no such requirement except for the exclusion of candidates with a criminal record.
        There is no obligation to prove a solid financial standing of the company either. An aspiring transport entrepreneur
   will have to demonstrate that he warrants support from the banks in order to buy a truck, but other than those checks,
   he is not required to lodge any sort of collateral with any regulator.
        Concisely, anyone can establish a road freight transport company, regardless of their education, training, employment
   background, good repute and/or financial status. There are no restrictions on access to markets: no authorizations or
   trip permits, or quotas, or prescribed routes, etc.
        As to the domestic environment, recently (around 2005) the industry recognized that poor compliance with transport
   regulations creates an unfair competitive environment. It was therefore felt that a self-regulation scheme is required to
   create standard rules for the industry, and that these rules should become the ‘business norm’—supporting the principles
   of good corporate governance. Therefore a self-regulation scheme, the Road Transport Management System (RTMS)
   was introduced in 2006. RTMS is an industry-led self-regulation scheme that encourages consignees, consignors and
   transport operators engaged in the road logistics value chain to implement a vehicle management system that preserves
   road infrastructure, improves road safety and increases the productivity of the logistics value chain. This scheme also
   supports the Department of Transport’s National Freight Logistics Strategy. RTMS’s mission is to provide a national
   management system (standards, auditors, manuals) and implementation support (information portals, recognition,
   technology transfer) for heavy vehicle road transport to consignees, consignors and transport operators. This type
   of initiative may contribute to establishing a level playing field by removing incompliant operators, thus increasing
   professionalism and fair business practices in the road freight transport industry.

   BOX 8  European Union—Criteria for Access to the Profession of Road Transport Operator

   Professional Competence of the Transport Manager
   This important criterion is met through the following conditions:
        •	 possession of knowledge corresponding to the level of training provided by regulation
        •	 compulsory written examination which may be supplemented by an oral examination
        •	 exemption being possible for applicants with at least five years’ practical experience, provided such applicants
           pass a test, as well as for holders of advanced diplomas
   Good Repute of the Transport Manager
   The good repute is established by proving:
        •	 the absence of conviction for serious criminal offences, including offences of commercial nature
        •	 not to be declared unfit to pursue the occupation
        •	 the absence of conviction for other offences, like pay and employment conditions in the profession, rules of
           road transport, and in particular drivers’ driving and rest periods, weights and dimensions of commercial
           vehicles, road and vehicle safety, the protection of the environment
   Sound Financial Standing
   This condition is to be satisfied by the company by demonstrating:
        •	 sufficient resources shall be available to ensure proper launching and proper administration of the undertaking
        •	 for assessment purposes, review of annual accounts, funds available, assets, costs, premises, plants, equipment
        •	 the undertaking must have available capital and reserves of at least €9,000 when only one vehicle is used and at
           least €5,000 for each additional vehicle
         The criteria form the basis for licensing road transport operators and must be met permanently. In case one or more
   conditions are not met, the company must notify the authority and will benefit from a transitional period to regularize
   its situation (6 months). Failing to inform, or at the end of the period if the conditions are not satisfied, access to the
   profession may be suspended until conditions are met again.
         The criteria shall be implemented in all EU Member States and may be stricter on a national level. They should
   however be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. If they are fulfilled, the operator is entitled to receive a Community
   license. Such a license gives, without any capacity restrictions, full access to the market. This entails all freight transport
   between two EU Member States, transit through an EU Member State and transport within a EU Member State,
   regardless the EU Member State where the vehicle is registered. Own account transport may be exempted from a license.
         Repeated or severe infringement to the transport governing rules may lead to a suspension or revocation of the
   access to the profession.

   BOX 9  Consolidated Resolution on the Facilitation of International Road Transport (R.E.4)

   R.E.4 was adopted in 2004 with the main message to UNECE Member States to liberalize the international road
   transport market, and harmonize the provisions of their international or bilateral transport agreements.
       In particular, the Resolution defines the “profession of international road transport operator” as the activity of any
   enterprise carrying out international transport of goods on the account of others by means of a vehicle or a collection
   of coupled vehicles. Under this definition, the resolution also provides for some minimum conditions and requirements
   to be met by an international road transport operator. In particular, it stipulates that in order to engage in the activity,
   transport undertakings must “first be licensed” by their national competent authority on the basis of the satisfaction of
   three basic criteria:
        •	 Good repute, which is considered to be met by that person managing the activity has not been convicted of
           criminal offense (including commercial crimes), is not unfit for the occupation and has not been convicted of
           serious breaches of labor, and transport law.
        •	 Adequate financial standing, which is met when evidences are demonstrated that the undertaking has available
           sufficient resources to ensure that the company is properly set up and managed. The resolution does not define
           amounts or ceiling of the financial means that must be available.
        •	 Professional competence, which is met by the person managing the activity when he demonstrates that he has
           sufficient knowledge to “engage properly and viably in the occupation” in particular in the fields of commercial
           and business administration, technical standards and operations, road safety, access to market, elements of
           company law, social and labor law, and civil and fiscal law.
       By that, the Resolution aims at harmonizing the rules applied to international transport markets, which should be
   accessible not on the basis of quotas but of qualitative criteria to be met by the operators willing to act on this market.

       BOX 10  Australia’s Compliance and Enforcement Bill30

       The National Transport Commission (NTC) has pioneered the development of a national compliance and enforcement
       reform package, which aims to further the achievement of nationally agreed road transport safety, productivity, asset
       protection and environmental reforms. The centerpiece of the package is the model Road Transport Reform (Compliance
       and Enforcement) Bill (the “C&E Bill”), which was approved unanimously by Australian transport ministers in November
       2003.
             The C&E Bill introduced the Chain of Responsibility concept—that is, that all those with responsibility for
       activities that affect compliance with the road transport laws should be held legally accountable if they do not meet their
       responsibility. Chain of Responsibility provisions in the Bill impose obligations on all parties in the transport chain and
       all individuals in the corporate chain of command. Those parties are required to either take reasonable steps to prevent
       a contravention of the road transport laws, or to not encourage or coerce others to contravene those laws.
             Special Chain of Responsibility provisions in Part 4 of the Bill provide that consignors, packers, loaders and receivers
       may be held legally liable for breaches of heavy vehicle mass, dimension and load restraint requirements, in addition
       to drivers and vehicle operators. In this way, off-road parties are as legally liable as their on-road counterparts are, if
       a breach of those requirements occurs. This enables authorities to better target the party or parties actually at fault in
       each case. It also reduces pressures on on-road parties and ultimately leads to improved compliance, and safer roads.
       The Chain of Responsibility approach has now been extended to model laws dealing with fatigue, the transportation of
       dangerous goods and heavy vehicle speeding.




           However, additional requirements should be                          by such a measure, because their operators might lose

BOX 12  The Experience of the European Union in Certifying Professional Competence

The main objective of Directive 2003/59/EC on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the
carriage of goods and passengers was to prescribe the minimum qualification and the training requirements of professional
drivers to enable them to meet the new demands arising from the development of the road transport market. EU
Member States have to issue the driver with a certificate of professional competence (CPC), certifying that the driver
complies with his or her obligations of initial qualification or periodic training. The Directive states that the duration
of the initial qualification of professional drivers is 280 hours; the driver also has to have at least 20 hours of additional
driving lessons to practice the learned concepts. There is also an accelerated initial qualification: if the driver complies
with certain requirements, the duration is 140 hours with an additional 10 hours of driving lessons. The Certificate of
Professional Competence can be obtained after exams. The requirements for the examination are detailed in an annex
to the Directive. A driver in the EU, who has a Certificate of Professional Competence, is also obliged to have a periodic
training of 35 hours every five years.
     The minimum qualification and training requirements are defined by Directive 2003/59/EC as follows.
Section 1: List of Subjects
The knowledge to be taken into account by Member States when establishing the driver’s initial qualification and periodic
training must include at least the subjects in this list. Trainee drivers must reach the level of knowledge and practical
competence necessary to drive in all safety vehicles of the relevant license category. The minimum level of knowledge is
defined in an annex to the Directive.
     The Lesson Plan will contain nine modules as presented below:

BOX 13  IRU Academy Accreditation Procedures

Accreditation requirements are key to quality control, and any training institute wishing to offer IRU Academy
training programmes must undergo accreditation for each programme, proving that they meet its requirements. The
IRU Academy programs are open to organizations with qualified instructors that are willing and capable of offering
internationally recognized high-quality training, such as road transport associations and operators, training institutes,
schools and universities.
     The accreditation process begins for each programme by applicants making an online application and completing
the respective application process. All accreditations share the following requirements:
Training Facilities
   •	 Each training institute must have its own training facilities for theoretical and practical training delivery.
   •	 Each training institute must have qualified IRU Academy certified instructors to cover all programmes.
Professional Training Program
   •	 Each training institute may directly use the IRU Academy programs’ content and materials
   •	 Each training institute must design a personalised program meeting national needs and requirements in full
      reference to the IRU Academy Program.
Involvement with National Authorities
Training institutes shall actively get involved with the national examination bodies to ensure that examination and the
training programs are established and delivered in full compliance with national requirements.
Accreditation Process & Certification
The accreditation process begins with an online application. The IRU Academy will accompany the candidate training
institute during the accreditation process to help them comply with the requirements. Accreditation is granted when all
the requirements are met, at which point the IRU Academy and the training institute will sign an agreement and an
accreditation certificate will be granted to the institute, which becomes an Accredited Training Institute (ATI). There
are three types of fees that the training institute will have to foresee in order to complete the accreditation process:
application fee, annual fee and per student fee. The fees are only meant to cover the administrative expenses, as the IRU
Academy is a nonprofit entity.
Accreditation Validity and Re-accreditation
The accreditation will remain valid as long as the training institute fulfils its commitments undertaken by the agreement
and can demonstrate its continued capacity to deliver training in the related program. If this is not the case anymore, the
IRU Academy may terminate the accreditation and/or ask the institute to undertake re-accreditation. To demonstrate
continued capacity to deliver training in the related programme and as a part of the re-accreditation process, the IRU
Academy may request that at least one principal program instructor attends a Train the Trainer course before granting
the accreditation again.

TABLE 7  Examples of Successful Feebate Schemes


 Country                                                           Scheme
 Austria           There is a fuel consumption tax that is levied on the purchase price (net) or commercial leasing fee
                   of certain categories of vehicles. For example, the formula for passenger cars (including mini-buses,
                   caravans) and combination cars is 2% 3 fuel consumption in liters/100km minus 3 l, respectively
                   minus 2 l for diesel vehicles; the fuel consumption tax must not exceed 16% of the invoice price.
                   Additionally, a bonus-malus system is included to account for emissions of CO2 (and NOx and PM).
 Belgium           Different schemes apply based on the region. In the Walloon region, a CO2 based bonus-malus
                   is added to the standard registration tax (based on fiscal horsepower). The benchmark is set at
                   81–145 g/km and the bonus varies between €500 and 3,500, while the malus varies between €100
                   and 2,500.
 Chile             There is a Feebate system with a benchmark of 175 grams of CO2 per kilometer, and it is estimated
                   that the incentive and disincentive system will imply a 5% reduction of CO2 emissions from the total
                   national vehicle fleet in 2014, obtaining a total CO2 reduction of 2.15 million tons during the next
                   5 years. A Chilean Auto Fuel Economy Label was developed for the national market and adopted in
                   April 2013.
 Denmark           There is a tax based on vehicle purchase price, a CO2 based correction is applied based on km/l. For
                   petrol-powered cars the registration tax is reduced at DKK 4,000 for every km that the car covers
                   more than 16 km/liter fuel (equivalent to 145 g CO2/km). For diesel-powered cars the registration tax
                   is reduced at DKK 4,000 for every km that the car covers more than 18 km/liter fuel (equivalent to
                   147.2 g CO2/km). For petrol-powered cars the registration tax is raised with DKK 1,000 for every km
                   that the car covers less than 16 km/liter fuel. For diesel-powered cars the registration tax is raised with
                   DKK 1,000 for every kilometer that the car covers less than 18 km/liter fuel.
 France            The bonus-malus program, part of the comprehensive environmental framework, was roughly
                   equivalent to €150/tCO2. In 2009 it paid buyers of cars emitting a maximum of 160 grams of
                   carbon dioxide per km a bonus ranging from €200 to 5,000 depending on emissions levels. In 2010,
                   the maximum limit for eligibility went down to 125 grams per km, and the bonuses were reduced.
                   France’s bonus-malus had an immediate effect (as shown in Table 8 below), lowering the average
                   emissions of cars sold by 5.4 g/km, entirely due to car buyers choosing lower emission vehicles. Due to
                   the high level of integration between countries in the EU, the purchase of new cars was also possible
                   in Ireland, where Irish customers that purchased new French cars could benefit by a grant from both
                   the French and Irish Governments.
 Israel            A “green” car tax reform came into effect in August 2009. It provides incentives for buyers of low-
                   polluting vehicles. Purchase tax rate on a vehicle is directly linked to emission levels. There are
                   15 groups of vehicles, with the first representing the cleanest vehicle group and the 15th the most
                   polluting. The tax benefit is granted after applying the new standard purchase tax rate of 83 percent.
                   The benefit ranges from NIS 15,000 (US$3,900) for relatively clean vehicles, to zero for the most
                   polluting group.
 Japan             5% consumption tax on vehicles plus an annual automobile tax, which increases by engine size,
                   ranging from 29,500 to 111,000 yen. An additional 10% tax is levied on vehicles used for 13 years
                   (11 years for diesel vehicles) or longer. This tax is 5% of the purchase price for private cars and 3%
                   for commercial and mini-vehicles. Japan also levies tonnage tax according to vehicle weight at each
                   vehicle inspection. The tonnage tax for passenger cars is 5,000 yen per year for each 0.5 ton of gross
                   vehicle weight. Incentives were granted until April 30, 2012, for eco-friendly cars such as 100 percent
                   cut, 75 percent cut or 50 percent cut. A heavier tax is levied on vehicles used for 18 years or longer (for
                   example 6,300 yen per 0.5 ton for private passenger cars).

 Portugal          A Vehicle Registration Tax (ISV) is based on cylinder capacity and CO2 emissions. In addition, an
                   Ownership tax (Annual Circulation Tax—IUC) is also applied:

                        •	 for commercial vehicles, based on weight, axles and type of suspension
                   Vehicle Registration Tax is also subject to VAT (i.e.: car’s base price + ISV + VAT). A reduced rate of 10 to
                   50 percent may be applied depending on a range of aspects such as weight, usage of LPG fueled vehicles,
                   hybrid vehicles and motor homes. Imported used vehicles must pay ISV; however, when imported from
                   a European Union country, a reduced rate ranging between 20 and 55 percent may be applied based on
                   age. The reduced rate is applied to the total amount of tax to be paid. Electric vehicles are exempted from
                   ISV and IUC.
 Norway            A taxation system for all vehicles was introduced in 1996 “engangsavgift” where registration tax was based
                   50% on weight, 30% on engine displacement, and 20% on power (stroke volume) of the vehicle. This tax
                   system therefore placed a higher burden on larger vehicles and vehicles with larger engine sizes. In 2007,
                   CO2 emissions replaced stroke volume and since then the CO2 variable gains more momentum in the
                   tax equation every year, favoring smaller cars and engines and penalizing heavy cars with large engines.
                   Automobiles using CFC air-conditioning equipment cannot be imported into Norway. Electric cars are
                   not subject to any tax at all, can drive in commuting lanes, park and charge batteries for free, and drive
                   through toll stations without paying.
 Netherlands       Part of the registration tax is based on purchase price, the rest on CO2 emissions. A special regime is in
                   place for low emission vehicles. For gasoline vehicles with emissions of no more than 102g/km, the tax
                   rate is 0 (also the part related to net list price). For diesel vehicles with emissions below 70g/km, the same
                   holds. Diesel vehicles with emissions higher than 70 but not higher than 91g/km only pay the CO2 part
                   of the tax, at a rate of €40.68/(g/km over 70g/km). Diesel cars with Euro 6 engines benefit from a rebate
                   on the BPM of €1,000 and €500 in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Zero-emission vehicles, including electric
                   vehicles, are exempt from the tax.
 Finland           A vehicle registration tax is calculated based on a formula which takes into account the CO2 emissions, by
                   adding 0.122 percent for every g/km exceeding 60 g/km to 4.88 percent. In practice, the minimum tax is
                   12.2 percent and the maximum 48.8 percent.
 Romania           First introduced a ban on the importation of used vehicles older than 8 years in the mid-nineties. The
                   measure was also meant to encourage local consumption, as the country was manufacturing vehicles under
                   a national brand. However, capacity of enforcement was also weak and the ban could be circumvented. In
                   2007, after the accession of the country to the EU, a tax was adopted on first-time registration, calculated
                   based on vehicle’s engine size and age—the bigger and older the car, the higher the tax. The tax was used
                   for “green” programs such as a “cash-for-clunkers” programs, reforestations and improving the energy
                   efficiency of buildings. The measure later re-adjusted such that the older the vehicle, the smaller the amount
                   paid. The rationale was that the older the car the lesser the number of years left to pollute.

     BOX 14  Gradual but Comprehensive Reform in Turkey61

     The example of Turkey is relevant for conducting in a gradual manner a comprehensive reform of road transport
     services. In the context of a steady economic growth and an intense international trade, Turkey had to harmonize its
     laws and practices with those of their major trade partner, the EU.
           To this end, the authorities introduced at the beginning of the year 2000 criteria for market access and access to the
     profession, as well as a mandatory certification of professional competence (CPC) for professional drivers, and medium
     and high level managers operating in road transport sector. These created a well-established, professional and influential
     road transport industry. In order to get an operating license, the transport operator must pay a fee, based on the business
     plan and the type of license required; part of the fee is earmarked by the Ministry of Transport for a “Scrapping Fund.”
           Turkey is a vehicle manufacturer and road safety is a declared top priority of the Government, therefore the country
     is prohibiting the importation of used vehicles. In addition, in 2009 it was decided that for road safety purposes, there
     will be a gradual withdrawal of old motor vehicles from traffic and the market, without an obligation to buy a new
     vehicle. In a first stage, this program concerned vehicles older than 30 years (trucks with permissible maximum weights
     of more than 3,500 kg and buses with more than 16 seats including the driver). The owners of vehicles were paid a small
     compensation through the “Scrapping Fund” established by the Ministry of Transport. The program was the result
     of a thorough inter-sectoral analysis and design, which took into account, for example, that in the majority of cases,
     30+ years vehicles are immobilized and ownership tax (and maybe late payment fee, fine, penalty) has not been paid for
     a number of years. As an incentive, the owners of such vehicles would be exempted from paying the amounts owed to
     the authority in charge with revenue collection.
           It was planned that eventually 160,000 vehicles older than 30 years would be removed from the domestic market in the
     first phase. In the first year after the adoption of the measure, roughly 23,500 vehicles were scrapped. The positive start of the
     program led the Turkish authorities to envisage a second phase, during which another 200,000 old vehicles would be scrapped.
           In parallel, in order to optimize the investments in infrastructure and in improving the road transport services, in
     2007, Turkey signed a Public Service Concession Agreement for 20 years for the construction and operation of state-of-
     the-art vehicle inspection stations with a leading international group. As a result, in the first year after the agreement was
     signed, due to the high quality inspections with modern equipment, 36 percent of the vehicles inspected were rejected
     because they did not comply with the norms and were sent to repair shops. Two years after the agreement was signed
     there were 189 fixed and 78 mobile inspection stations operating in 81 cities throughout the country.
           The next step taken by Turkey was to establish a program for the creation of a Weight and Dimension Control
     Station (WDC) network with high technology equipment. A comprehensive investment plan has been prepared for
     increasing the number of control stations up to 160 by 2020. All these WDC Stations will be located on the international
     axes and intense traffic arteries mainly used by heavy-good vehicles.

     BOX 15  Fleet Renewal in Morocco

     In Morocco, the Government took a holistic approach in reforming the road transport industry that started with
     the adoption of a comprehensive law70 which entered into force in 2003. In the frame of the reform, fleet renewal
     schemes were defined and adjusted every two years to take into account new developments. The first71 stage has been
     implemented between 2006 and 2008 and was basically a buyback scheme. The old vehicles candidates for scrapping
     were eligible if they (i) were 15+ years old, (ii) were in working condition for at least 3 months without interruption in
     the 12 months preceding the request for scrapping, and (iii) they belonged to the owner before the starting date of the
     program. The scrapping premium was set between MAD 45,000 and 85,000 (approx. $4,950–9,350) per vehicle, an
     amount that the owner was obliged to use for purchasing a new vehicle. This first stage of the scheme was not a success,
     because the transport operators found the premium too low.
          The program continued in 2008–2010 with increased premiums between MAD 90,000 and 130,000 (approx.
     $9,900–14,300) per vehicle, and additional requirements to effectively and completely scrap the old vehicle and to
     purchase a new vehicle equipped with all the safety features required by the regulations in force and a maximum
     permissible laden weight of 15+ tons. This program also allowed transport operators to use premiums for the purchase
     of articulated vehicles (tractor plus [semi]trailer) or of trailers specialized for the transport of containers, which had to
     comply with international standards in force.
          In 2010 the Government and the private sector signed a programmatic contract for the development of the logistics
     competitiveness for the period 2010–2015, one component being the regulation and the modernization of the road
     transport of goods. In this framework, the fleet renewal program continued in 2011–2013 under the objective of
     improving road safety and transport operations’ efficiency and it covered the fleet for commercial transport and for
     the rural public transport of passengers—trucks and buses respectively. The scheme was implemented by the Ministry
     of Transport, which allocated a maximum annual amount of MAD 170 million (approx. $19 million) from the State
     budget. The earmarked budget was mainly fed by 50 percent of the fines for violations of transport laws and regulations
     (including speed-driving) and the value of the material from scrapped vehicles.
          The program was adopted under the objective of improving road safety and transport operations’ efficiency and it
     covered the fleet for commercial transport and for the rural public transport of passengers—trucks and buses respectively.
          Eligible owners of old vehicles had to be formally registered as transport operators, certified by (i) being recorded in
     a special professional register (for the goods transport), or (ii) be in possession of a rural transportation agreement72 (for
     the passengers transport). The old vehicles candidates for scrapping were eligible if they (i) were 15+ years old, (ii) were
     in working condition for at least 3 months without interruption in the 12 months preceding the request for scrapping,
     and (iii) they belonged to the owner before the starting date of the program. In case of legal persons established after that
     date, the vehicle had to have been owned by one of the associates in the company prior to the beginning of the program.
          Eligible transport operators were entitled to a benefit of the premium for the purchase of a new vehicle if:
          •	 the old vehicles have been entrusted to a designated body for effective scrapping and elimination from traffic;
          •	 the new vehicles were equipped with all the safety features required by the regulations in force;
          •	 the new truck had a maximum permissible laden weight of 15+ tons; and
          •	 the new bus corresponded to a very specific category (defined by law), had 15 places and was less than 2 years
             old (from the first registration).
            For the commercial transport of goods, the buyer of one new truck was allowed to cumulate the premiums for two
     old trucks scrapped.
            The amount of the premium for scrapped vehicles was established, based on their age and maximum permissible
     laden weight. The premium varied between MAD 90,000 and 155,000 (approx. $10,100–17,500) for a truck and between
     MAD 70,000 and 110,000 (approx. $7,900–12,400) for a bus. During 2008–2013 the program allowed the purchase of
     1,374 vehicles (387 tractors and 987 [semi]trailers); the average age of the fleet went down from 14 to 12.45 years.
            The program continued in 2014–2016 with new adaptations to the development of the market and industry. For
     the   first time the premium was differentiated between “scrapping”72

     vehicles would not be obliged anymore to use the scrapping premium for the purchase of a new vehicle. Within the
     existing budget, renewal premiums were given priority. In addition, for the transport of goods, the law allowed the use
     of three scrapping premiums for the purchase of one new truck, which also reflected a consideration of balancing the
     transport capacity with the demand.
           An estimation made by the private sector73 shows that in addition to invaluable gains from reducing emissions,
     replacing a 10+ years old vehicle with a Euro 4 standard one would result in annual savings of 15,000 liters of fuel per

     In case of a 7 years depreciation period the amount of fuel saved would still be 105,000 liters or 859,950 MAD (approx.
     $94,600). The number of vehicles that need to be replaced was estimated to be 36,000; this means that the new vehicles
     will save 540 million liters annually or 5,400 liters for a 10 years depreciation or 3780 liters for 7 years respectively. These
     savings amount to 30–44 billion MAD (approx. $3.3–4.8 billion), in addition to 7–10 times less emissions.

the journey the drive axle load will be 11.5 tonnes, but will
