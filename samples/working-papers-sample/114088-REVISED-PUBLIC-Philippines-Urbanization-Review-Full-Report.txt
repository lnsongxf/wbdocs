Memorandum to Policy Makers and City Mayors
in the Philippines
This memo introduces you to a report about Urbanization in the Philippines with a set of priority recommendations for
fostering more competitive, sustainable and inclusive cities in your country. The global evidence is clear – urbanization
provides enormous opportunities for growth, job creation and poverty reduction. Yet when unmanaged, it can lead to
congestion, slums, pollution, inequality and crime.


The Philippines is at a critical juncture in its urbanization process with the number of people living in cities projected to
increase by approximately 20 million over the next 20 years. By 2050, it is estimated that close to 102 million Filipinos will live
in cities, about double the number of today. Decisions made now will afect how that urbanization takes place, how cities
grow, how vibrant they are, and the extent to which they contribute to improving the lives of tens of millions of residents.
The opportunity, therefore, lies in ensuring that some of the binding constraints that have hampered the full beneits of
urbanization from being realized until now, are addressed. This will require a number of bold policy reforms that are needed
at both the national and local level.


The top priorities fall into 5 broad categories with the inal two, strengthening institutions for urban development and
improving land administration management, likely to have the biggest impact given the extent to which efective urban
governance and land issues constrain urban development in the Philippines today. For your consideration are the following
areas for policy reform:


•   Managing urbanization for eiciency and growth. The spatial and economic patterns of urbanization are impeding
    urban led growth and productivity. Priority policies include focusing on managing the existing urban density and
    preparing for further concentration such as better coordinating spatial planning, land use, infrastructure development
    and service delivery, encouraging mobility in the labor market, and improved transport infrastructure to lower inter-city
    transportation costs, expand market access, and generate complementary and specialized functions for each city to
    formulate a more eicient system of cities. Within cities, the promotion of eicient and afordable mass transport such
    as metro rail transit (MRT) and bus rapid transit (BRT) will increase productivity and improve sustainability. Eicient
    land use through transit-oriented development (TOD) has been demonstrated to be a high-value complement to mass
    transit in many other countries.


•   Improving city competitiveness for local economic development and job creation. There are a number of actions
    needed to improve the business environment to make cites more attractive to investors such as simplifying licensing and
    permitting, and standardizing requirements and procedures. Investing in basic infrastructure, particularly connective
    infrastructure and mass transit, and opening up land markets to make areas more available for development will foster a
    competitive environment. Strengthening programs to foster innovation and match skills with demand, strengthening
    the Local Economic and Investment Promotion Oices (LEIPOs) and promoting new opportunities with the private
    sector will generate new opportunities for workers.

•   Promoting inclusive growth by creating opportunities for the urban poor. There are many people in cities that rely
    entirely on the informal sector for work, and live without access to afordable housing and basic services, ultimately
    creating divisions which hamper growth and competitiveness. To promote inclusion in cities, there is a need to prioritize
    programs for afordable housing and basic services, foster participation at the community level for slum upgrading,
    provide incentives for completion of secondary education which is critical to securing jobs, and invest in livelihoods
    and job support for low income groups.


•   Strengthening institutions and governance of metropolitan areas for eicient service delivery and sustainable urban
    planning and management. At the core of the efective management of cities, delivery of services and creation of
    a dynamic environment for job creation is strong institutions and good governance. A necessary starting point
    is a comprehensive national urban policy that includes provision for the establishment of a lead agency for urban
    development and housing, and clearly deines the roles of national and local governments. Structural reforms to the
    legal framework for iscal decentralization will also be required to strengthen local service delivery. At the metropolitan
    level, a reform of Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is needed for Metro Manila and the development of
    metropolitan coordination arrangements in some of the larger secondary urban areas.


•   Improving land administration and management to open up land markets. Improvements in land information systems
    are critically needed so that can be used reliably and transparently across agencies, updating land use planning and
    regulations that takes into account future requirements and sustainability concerns, improving property taxation and
    valuation practices to ensure the proper collection of real property taxes, and addressing informality by expanding
    opportunities for afordable housing and land tenure.


Implementing such reforms in the Philippines is possible but will require a strong commitment from you, your counterparts
in other agencies or neighboring municipalities, and from the private sector and citizens. The investments made now will
provide a pathway forward for the Philippines where urban areas contribute signiicantly to boosting growth and reducing
poverty, and are dynamic, prosperous, resilient, inclusive and attractive places to live.

Executive Summary

Introduction

Urbanization is a driving force for growth and poverty reduction. Globally, over 80 percent of economic activity is
concentrated in cities, and cities are essential for lifting millions of people out of poverty through the opportunities that
density and agglomeration can bring with jobs, services, and innovation. However, if not carefully managed and planned
for, the beneits of urbanization are not realized and can result in congestion, slums, pollution, inequality and crime.


City competitiveness is an important part of successful urbanization. A competitive city facilitates its irms and industries
to create jobs, raise productivity, and increase the incomes of citizens over time.1 At the same time, it is not possible to
achieve these objectives without strong institutions, social inclusion, resilience, and environmental sustainability. All of
these elements are important to harnessing the beneits of urbanization and must be enabled by both national and local
governments.


The Philippines is one of the fastest urbanizing countries in the East Asia and Paciic region. In the past ive decades the
urban population grew by over 50 million people, and by 2050, approximately 102 million people (more than 65 percent
of the country’s total population) will reside in cities. Urban density overall is high, particularly in Metro Manila, one of the
regions fast growing megacities.


Urbanization is correlated with economic eiciency and growth in the Philippines, as has been found in other countries.
The economic beneits of urbanization are realized through agglomeration economies based on the high and increasing
density of cities which provides much opportunity for structural transformation of the economy


While urbanization in the Philippines has had positive impacts on increased productivity, economic growth and poverty
reduction, the country has not beneited from urbanization gains as much as other countries which leaves much scope
for increasing opportunities going forward. There are a number of underlying structural issues afecting urbanization in
the Philippines in various ways. First is the countries’ archipelagic geography which creates divisions in connectivity both
internally and to external markets. Second is the country’s bypassing the industrialization process normally associated with
urbanization, having shifted directly from agriculture to service sector dominance. Third is a stagnating manufacturing
sector which has not resulted in high quality jobs and, in turn, has negatively afected urban led growth. In all known cases
of high and sustained growth, urban manufacturing and services led the process while increases in agricultural productivity
freed up the labor force that moved to the cities and manned factories.2 Fourth, is the Philippines high exposure to natural
hazards, particularly looding and seismic risk, all of which exacerbate urban management challenges.

Beyond these key structural issues are two binding constraints which, unlike the structural issues, can be addressed
through a bold reform agenda. These include highly fragmented institutional arrangements for urban development and
metropolitan governance, and major shortcomings in land administration and management. The resulting impacts of these
issues coupled with rapid urbanization have greatly hampered city competitiveness afecting economic development, job
creation, poverty reduction and livability.


This being said, there are many encouraging opportunities for better leveraging urbanization in the Philippines. One only
has to look at the vibrant private sector and development of areas such as Bonifacio Global City in Taguig City, or the IloIlo
Business Park in IloIlo, City, Center, or a number of successful programs at the local level to know what is possible. To realize
these opportunities, however, commitment to implement bold reforms will be needed by a range of stakeholders including
national and local government, the private sector and civil society.


This policy report aims to analyze key issues related to urbanization in the Philippines and provide a set of recommendations
as part of a major reform agenda for improving the competitiveness of cities in the country. The report draws on a number
of existing data sets, extensive consultations with Government, the private sector, researchers and civil society groups. It
also draws on international experience on urbanization.


Chapter 1 of the report provides an introduction to urbanization in the Philippines. Chapter 2 covers analysis of urbanization
and growth in the Philippines, Chapter 3 focuses on city competitiveness for economic development and job creation,
Chapter 4 provides an analysis of urban poverty with a particularly focus on informal settler families (ISFs) in Metro Manila,
Chapter 5 outlines the key binding constraints related to institutions for urban development and metropolitan governance;
and Chapter 6 covers constraints related to land administration and management in urban areas. Each chapter includes a
framework for analysis, identiication and assessment of key issues, and provides recommendations for the Government of
the Philippines to consider. Important topics related to environmental sustainability and resilience are included as a cross
cutting issue as they relate to urban planning and land management, but not covered in depth as they have been addressed
in other World Bank reports. The full study is summarized below. Background technical papers for each section have also
been prepared and cover much more analysis and detail. These are available as a companion to this policy report.




Urbanization and Economic Growth

Urbanization presents a great opportunity for the economic growth of the Philippines. Evidence from today’s developed
countries and rapidly emerging economies suggests that urbanization and economic growth go hand in hand due to
agglomeration economies embedded in the high density of cities. The Philippines has the second highest average urban
density in East Asia and Paciic Region and it is still increasing. This provides a potential driver for enhanced productivity
and economic growth. Rising population and economic densities could enable savings in transport and communication
costs, lead to frequent interactions, enable iner specialization and knowledge spillovers, and heighten competition in
product and labor markets. A clear densiication process has been experienced by Metro Manila since 1990s together with a
structural transformation of the urban economy, with industries moving out of the central urban areas into the metro fringe
and secondary cities, and replaced by services, which can lead to a more eicient system of cities based on experience from
developed countries.
                                                                                                              xiii


The economic beneits from urbanization in the Philippines, however, are yet to be fully harnessed. Realization of eiciency
gains from urbanization have been hampered by some key challenges, which can be summarized from the dimensions of
Density, Distance and Division.


•   Density. The fast growing urban population and urban density have not been accompanied by commensurate
    investments in urban infrastructure, as exacerbated by the weak and fragmented institutions and governance for urban
    and metropolitan management and service delivery, leading to congestion diseconomies associated with land scarcity
    and lack of basic services such as clean water and sanitation, and housing, increases in natural hazard risk and pollution,
    and rising commuting costs, which have most clearly manifested in Metro Manila.


•   Distance. The country faces signiicant connectivity challenges from infrastructure bottlenecks alongside the
    archipelagic geography. Inadequacy of urban and regional transportation infrastructure remains a major constraint in
    the movement of people and commodities between production and consumption centers as well as between urban
    centers. The high domestic transport cost increases economic distance between cities, limits the potential for cities
    to diversify or specialize based on their comparative advantage and trade with each other, and thus undermines the
    eiciency of the whole city network.


•   Division. The economic, social and spatial exclusion in urban areas are most prominently manifested by the large scale
    of ISFs living in poor conditions with limited access to basic urban services. Such divisions and inequality can also be
    detrimental to the development of a vibrant urban middle class whose consumption patterns can boost domestic
    demand and a more service based urban economy.


Competitiveness for Economic Development and Job Creation

City competiveness is important to job creation, growth and livability. Both national and local governments have a role
in providing an enabling environment that facilitates irms and industries to create jobs, raise productivity and increase
the incomes of citizens over time. The primary source of job creation in cities all over the world has been the growth of
private sector irms, which have typically accounted for around 75 percent of job creation. In recent years large cities in
the Philippines have been the main drivers of growth consistently outperforming the national economy. The rise of service
sector, particularly the BPO industry, have led to creation of hundreds of thousands of well paid jobs. However Filipino cities
remain behind their international peers, suggesting the need for reforms to improve the potential for additional economic
growth and job creation in cities. Several key issues have been identiied as major obstacles.


Poor business environment. Business regulations in the Philippines are among the most complex in East Asia, and impact
overall job creation. The World Bank Doing Business 2016 report ranks the Philippines 103 out of 189 in overall ease of doing
business with only Indonesia ranking lower (109) among major regional economies. Cities impose additional constraints
on national level regulations and fail to adopt best practice solutions plenty of which are available within the country. As a
result, starting a business, paying taxes, construction permits, and registering property are all especially onerous.

Weak infrastructure, land management and access to markets. The high costs and unreliable provision of internet,
water, and electricity serve to undermine irm productivity and growth. Poor telecommunication infrastructure in particular
limits the growth of the business process outsourcing sector, an important source of well-paying jobs. Cities are also crippled
by traic due to underinvestment in transportation infrastructure. High infrastructure, logistics and shipping costs, coupled
with corruption, has led the Philippines to have higher than average bilateral trade and export costs within the region and
limited access to international markets.


Low demand for innovation and skill match. The Philippines spends only 0.1 percent of GDP on R&D, behind all regional
peers with the exception of Indonesia. According to the Global Innovation Index, it also lags behind peers in research
outputs, patents and intellectual property rights. The combined negative impact of poor business environment, lack of
access to early-stage inance and weak access to domestic and global markets has resulted in cities like Metro Manila, Cebu
and Davao being unable to leverage substantial human capital potential to enhance innovation. This is compounded by a
lack of coordination between the university system and the private sector, and an overall mismatch between the skills of
university graduates and the needs of the business community.


Limited access to inance and business support. The banking sector in the Philippines is stable, proitable and
well capitalized, but provides limited inancing to micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs). The lack of legal
protection for bank supervisors, an inadequate bankruptcy resolution framework, lack of centralized credit information, and
a cumbersome collateral registration process all result in overly conservative guidelines for credit operations. As a result,
many large banks fail to meet the legal target of loans to MSMEs accounting for at least 8 percent of the lending portfolio.
Other forms of public business support while plentiful sufer from poor coordination and lack of monitoring and evaluation
systems that allow for assessment of efectiveness of such programs.


Insuicient economic planning. Many city-level economic development programs, with a possible exception of the few
most developed cities in Metro Manila, are under-resourced and fail to reach a critical mass to tangibly support the private
sector. Furthermore, a lack of clarity of the economic development functions of both local and national government agencies
undermines eiciency. While at the local level lack of transparency and ineicient organization of economic function in city
halls becomes a hindrance for economic growth.




Inclusive Growth for Pro-Poor Development and City Competitiveness

Inclusive urbanization, where everyone can reap the beneits of urban growth, is a key aspect of competitive cities. If
urbanization is managed well, it can provide a pathway out of poverty and act as an engine of growth. If not, it can give rise
to inequality and exclusion that can derail the development process. As mentioned above, the challenges of division as
manifested through economic, spatial and social exclusion ultimately afect opportunities in cities.
                                                                                                               xv


Rising multi-dimensional urban poverty, inequality and high levels of informality. Urban poverty has remained
largely unchanged between 2003 and 2012, while national poverty decreased slightly. Yet, disparities in living conditions are
most evident in urban areas as cities fail to keep pace with the increased demand for jobs, housing, infrastructure and basic
services. Not all informal settlers are income poor, but many live just above the poverty line and are extremely vulnerable to
slipping back into poverty with potential external shocks such as natural disasters and illnesses.


Informal employment and low wages. Urban poor sufer from high underemployment, which was twice as high (29%)
as that of urban non-poor (14.7%) in 2012. This signiies that urban poor are predominantly engaged in part-time or casual
labor, which is informal by nature, and sufer from unstable and low income. The urban poor are afected by informality
and low wages due to low levels of education. Workers with less than secondary education face substantially worse labor
market prospects than those who completed high school. Their earnings are signiicantly lower, and the risk of poverty is
much higher. Indeed, a survey of 3,000 ISFs in Metro Manila found that 53% have less than secondary education, severely
limiting their job opportunities. Research shows that most urban poor prefer formal wage employment should there be
opportunities. But many are trapped in informal service sector and are engaged in self-entrepreneurship “out of necessity”.


Large and growing slum populations and limited basic services. Informal settlements vividly depict multi-dimensional
poverty in the Philippines. The high rate of migration to cities has put enormous pressure on needs for housing, infrastructure,
and basic services in major cities. The result has been proliferation of informal settlers without adequate access to decent
living conditions with security of tenure. The number of informal settlers in the Philippines has increased gradually, from
4.1% of total urban population in 2003 to 5.4% in 2012. In 2012, 5.4% of the urban population or about 2.2 million people
lived in informal settlements. In Metro Manila alone, an estimated 1.3 million people live in informal settlements.


Exposure to natural and other hazards. Many informal settlements are located on river loodplains or along shorelines
exposing informal settlers to recurring loods. This creates an enormous burden in terms of loss of livelihood, damage to
housing and assets, and increased health risks due to prolonged exposure to water pollution. Fires in congested informal
settlements are also quite common creating additional risk to low income families.


Social problems of crime and violence. The rates of crime and violence are higher in cities than the national average
and understood to disproportionately afect the urban poor. Numbeo data shows that Quezon City, Zamboanga, Bacolod,
Manila and Cebu in that order have the highest crime rates in the country. Many low income residents report feeling unsafe,
with the group considered most at risk for getting involved in criminal activity being male youth who have dropped out of
school or are unemployed.

Institutions for Urban and Metropolitan Management and Service Delivery

Strong institutions and governance are critical to the efective management of cities, the delivery of eicient and sustainable
urban services and infrastructure, and the establishment of an enabling environment for business and job creation. In the
Philippines, a number of underlying institutional and governance issues at both the national and metropolitan levels stand
out as binding constraints, preventing the country from optimizing the beneits of urban development. With continued
expansion and population growth in urban areas, the need for the Philippines to address these issues becomes more urgent.


Absence of a comprehensive national urban policy. An efective national urban policy (NUP)—including legal
foundations, capable institutions, and inancial instruments—is critical for designing and building productive, livable,
and resilient cities. The Philippines has historically lacked an efective and comprehensive policy that deines a vision for
urban development that is supported by strategies and linked actions to realize the potential and to tackle the problems
arising from the concentrated growth of population and economic activity. Encouragingly, a number of existing national
planning frameworks, such as the National Urban Development and Housing Framework and the National Framework for
Physical Planning, attempt to address speciic dimensions of urban development. However, past administrations have not
prioritized such plans, and as a result, relevant national agencies have not been empowered to enforce them. The ineicient
spatial pattern of urbanization at the macro level, with an over-concentration of development in Metro Manila and the
underdevelopment of secondary urban areas, is a consequence of the absence of a national urban policy in the Philippines.


Absence of a lead agency for urban development and housing. An already complex environment for urban
development is exacerbated by institutional fragmentation. Numerous regulatory and sectoral agencies have overlapping
mandates and functions, with no single designated national authority to oversee urban development. Due to the absence
of a lead agency for urban development and housing, formal mechanisms for both horizontal coordination (across sectoral
agencies) and vertical coordination (between national agencies and LGUs) within urban areas are very weak, which has
contributed to poor urbanization outcomes as they relate to city competitiveness, mobility, poverty and inequality, and
environmental quality.


Fiscal decentralization complicates urban service delivery. The intergovernmental iscal system supporting LGUs
has not been conducive to improving local service delivery. Structural weaknesses in the institutional and legal framework
for iscal decentralization constrain the capacities of LGUs to efectively and eiciently provide urban services. Furthermore,
an institutional environment characterized by overlapping accountabilities across levels of government, the absence of
standards for service delivery, and poor availability of information on service delivery provides weak demand-side and
supply-side incentives for LGU performance. Relative to other types of LGUs, cities enjoy productive property and business
tax bases and are less dependent on iscal transfers to inance recurring expenditures. In contrast to the vast majority of
provinces and municipalities, most cities are able to raise local revenues to fund the majority of their local expenditures.
Nonetheless, cities continue to lack the iscal capacity to independently undertake major urban infrastructure projects and
remain reliant on the national government for major public infrastructure investments, such as major road and bridge
construction, drainage and lood control facilities, housing, and solid waste management facilities.
                                                                                                              xvii


Metropolitan fragmentation and weak mechanisms for inter-jurisdictional coordination. Urban areas in the
Philippines face the same broad issues of metropolitan fragmentation that are confronted by metropolitan regions across
the world. As urban expansion leads to mismatches between socio-economic (functional) areas and administrative (spatial)
jurisdictions, city and municipal mayors have to grapple with the demands for inter-jurisdictional coordination to efectively
and eiciently provide core urban services with metropolitan-wide dimensions, such as traic management, solid waste
and environmental management, and road infrastructure. The experience of MMDA shows that a metropolitan authority
created without the proper resources, both inancial and technical, has limited potential to fulill a comprehensive mandate.
MMDA has historically lacked the funding, technical capacity, and political authority to properly fulill its role, leading to
poor service delivery outcomes highlighted by an on-going transportation crisis. Outside of Metro Manila, there have been
no eforts by the national government to establish formal metropolitan arrangements. Composite urban LGUs are left to
voluntarily pursue coordination agreements with minimal external support, resulting in varied quality of service delivery and
inadequate management across urban areas.




Land Administration and Management for Efective and Sustainable Urban Development

Land administration and management systems (LAM) help shape the spatial, economic and social development in cities.
Weak land administration and management, poor land use planning, and limited capacities in property taxation and
valuation in the Philippines are also binding constraints which have far ranging efects on the vibrancy of the land market,
in shaping and rationalizing urban growth in a sustainable manner, and in generating revenues to support programs to
improve urban life.


Weak land administration and management system. There are multiple institutions with overlapping mandates that
address land in the Philippines. Poor information sharing between these institutions creates gaps in records, multiple titles
on the same land, and fake and spurious titles which all serve to undermine investor conidence in the titling system.
Secondly, incomplete cadastral surveys have resulted in unresolved conlicts and boundary disputes among local
governments. This has created governance issues in afected areas – such as inconsistent taxation, conlicting land uses,
unclear responsibilities in service provision, and computation of national government transfers. Third is the huge backlog in
titling. In the face of rising land values, this prevents proper land management in cities and can even constrain investments
in property development. This situation has also contributed to an incomplete tax base for real property taxes collection
eforts, and underdevelopment of high growth areas. Finally, slow registration and processing times for transfers, mortgages,
and securing BIR clearance has increased the cost of doing business in the Philippines.


Outdated and inefective land use planning and regulations. In cities such as Metro Manila and Cebu, comprehensive
land use plans (CLUP) are out of date. Of the sixteen cities and one municipality in Metro Manila, only ive cities have updated
CLUPs, while in Cebu city, the CLUP has not been updated since 1980. This has created a situation where urban land use
planning is not efective in controlling spatial development, and urban growth is happening in an ad hoc manner. Urban
sprawl has been the norm, compromising eiciency and negating many of the beneits of agglomeration. Additionally, the
review and approval of development permits has been discretionary. In the absence of updated CLUPs as a basis of zoning,
applications for land development have been evaluated on a piece meal basis, creating opportunities for improper and
corrupt practices.
            xviii                                                                              Philippines Urbanization Review




Increasing informality with many areas at high risk. The growth of ISF in Metro Manila and major urban centers has
partly been the consequence of weak planning and ad hoc spatial development. Issues of informality are further exacerbated
by limited information about ISF populations, hindering eforts to provide services and assistance. Guidelines and standards
for socialized housing are weakly enforced, and there have been systematic barriers in mobilizing government lands for ISF.
Rapid property development has also increased land prices beyond afordability, and ISF struggle to ind tenure options and
have their housing rights respected. Many also settle on lands that are high risk lood prone areas.


Inefective property taxation and valuation practices. Revenues from real property constitutes the most stable source
of income for local governments, and are important sources of resources to improve service delivery and inance infrastructure
projects. However, average real property tax collection by all LGUs has declined as proportion of GDP, representing only
0.35% in 2013 down from 0.45% in 2000. This can be explained in part by incomplete LGU assessment roles, which are overly
dependent on the self-reporting of property owner about the values of their lands. Information about land and properties is
also not frequently shared across government agencies and LGUs. Additionally, in many cities in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu
and Cagayan de Oro, property assessment for tax purposes is not based on market prices and the schedule of market values
are not updated regularly.




Recommendations

The analysis in this report raises a number of complex, deep rooted problems that have limited the Philippines from fully
beneiting from urbanization. Looking ahead, there are many opportunities for changing course towards more competitive,
sustainable and inclusive cities in the Philippines. This will require bold actions and a sustained commitment to prioritizing
investments in cities. Both Metro Manila and secondary cities have substantial needs for urban infrastructure, improving
the investment climate, and the delivery of basic services to residents. Actions are required at both the national and local
level, and will be reliant on strong leaders who are willing to take risks in a transparent and consultative manner, and push
forward on diicult reforms.


Given the size and complexity in Metro Manila, and its importance for the national economy, there is an urgent imperative to
prioritize a few critical areas that impede competitiveness such as congestion, urban looding, and slums. These issues span
across administrative boundaries and can only be solved through strong political commitment and coalitions for change in
metropolitan governance and land administration management. At the same time, investing in secondary cities presents
an enormous opportunity for shifting the overall balance of spatial development in the country, increasing productivity in
urban areas and avoiding many of the problems that have evolved over time in Metro Manila as these cities grow. Across all
cities, there are substantial needs to address iscal and capacity constraints to deliver core urban services.


Key recommendations are grouped into 5 priority areas, with two that stand out as top priorities for broadest impact:
i) addressing the binding constraints of weak institutions to improve the delivery of necessary infrastructure, services
and sustainable urban planning, and ii) improving land administration management to open up land markets for city
competitiveness. The recommendations are discussed in greater detail in the full report. A matrix of proposed level of
priority, time frame and implementing agency is also included.

1. Managing Urbanization for Eiciency and Growth


In order to maximize the economic gains from urbanization, policies on land use and investments in connective infrastructure
should focus on managing the existing urban density and prepare for further concentration. It is important to ensure
that spatial planning, land use, infrastructure development and service delivery can progress commensurately with the
population growth and density increase in existing urban areas. Policy measures are needed to make the productive factors,
such as land, people and capital, more eiciently allocated within cities. The land administration and management need to
be strengthened and the land use planning needs to be more efective so that the land market can function to meet the
needs of growing urban density. Infrastructure development needs to be coordinated with land use planning and addressed
as an integrated urban strategy that can cater to various user groups and anticipate long-term needs. More investments and
stronger management are needed to improve intra-city connectivity and reduce the actual distance between people and
jobs. Investments should be focused on increasing the capacity of existing road networks on one hand, and expanding and
modernizing the mass transit system on the other hand. Eicient land use through transit-oriented development (TOD) has
been demonstrated to be a high-value complement to mass transit development in many other countries.


Improve transport infrastructure to lower inter-city transport cost, expand market access and generate complementary and
specialized functions for each city, and formulate an eicient system of cities. Given the difering roles of cities in a national
urban portfolio where each has a comparative advantage, specialization can facilitate the beneits of agglomeration. Primary
cities such as Metro Manila typically serve as the gateway to the global economy with a strong service sector. Clustering of
manufacturing in secondary cites enables cost saving for irms due to relatively cheap land and labor. Meanwhile, producers
in the same or related industries gain from proximity to others through the sharing of capital inputs, information, and labor,
matching between production requirements and types of land, labor, and intermediate inputs and can help accelerate
industrial diversiication and upgrading for the country. The importance of secondary cities is already recognized by in the
Philippines through its National Spatial Strategy. Growth of secondary cities would also help absorb surplus labor from rural
areas and alleviate migration pressures on Manila. Key elements to fostering the growth of secondary cities are improved
transport infrastructure and low transport costs between cities which can enable irms to access local, regional, and global
markets—both for buying inputs and selling outputs, reinforce agglomeration efects and generate complementary and
specialized functions, as well as investments in quality basic services such as health and education to attract a well skilled
labor force. Policy measures to improve inter-city connectivity should be prioritized based on an integrated transport
framework that takes into account selectivity, sequencing and prioritization. New connective infrastructure investments
should be accessed based on their impacts on the entire existing transport network and respective overall and spatial
economic development. Accordingly, key data gaps, such as the absence of a national database of local roadways, needs to
be addressed to promote evidence based planning.

2. Improving City Competitiveness to Generate Local Economic Development and Foster Job Creation


Simplify business registration, licensing, and tax regimes to spur more rapid business growth. A healthy business environment
is essential for growth and poverty reduction. Yet, the Philippines ranks 103th among 189 countries in the World Bank
Doing Business 2016 report. In the short-term, the government should: (i) standardize requirements and procedures, (ii)
reduce or abolish the paid-in minimum capital requirement, (iii) make the use of notaries and lawyers optional for company
startups, and (iv) move toward a ixed registration fee that covers only administrative costs. Government should consider
disassociating business tax collection from business permit renewal, in line with international good practice. The simpliied
tax regime can encourage micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to move to the formal sector. Possible measures
include replacing the value-added tax (VAT), percentage tax, and income tax with a single business tax on turnover and ofer
a simpliied system of accounting and reporting. Modernization of tax payments through on line systems would increase
eiciency.3


Improve access to land and markets and upgrade infrastructure to foster better trade connectivity and higher irm
productivity. Given the fragmented market and archipelagic geography, good access to regional and international markets
and trade connectivity are essential for the Philippines. Accurate land information system on ownership, boundaries, and
land values available to all is urgently needed. Government should prioritize investments in connective infrastructure, mass
transit, and identifying areas of land for development to foster a more competitive environment for private sector. Reforms to
lower entry barriers for shipping and modernization of ports4 should be accelerated through coordinated eforts by Bureau
of Internal Revenues (BIR), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH)
to further simplify import-export procedures by streamlining customs and border management procedures, simplifying
the BIR importer licensing process, improving shipping/trucking/warehouse regulations and facilitating logistics services
multimodality. More investments are needed to improve roads, electricity, water, sanitation, transportation, communication
and upgrading of ports to improve productivity and connectivity. The Competition Commission which became operational
in 2016 has substantial power to promote fair competition across industries and can help to promote competition in the
network industries, particularly the telecoms, to encourage sharing of infrastructure by providers, increased competition on
the price and quality, and more inclusive access, especially for broadband Internet.


Strengthen innovation systems that drive productivity and sustained economic growth. Filipino cities, with their high
levels of human capital, well-established university systems, and vibrant business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, have
high potential to breed innovative activities. Yet, their potential is not maximized. The establishment of a new lagship
entrepreneurship agency would help to consolidate various existing support programs and centralize resources available
for supporting innovation. There is also much potential for expanding collaboration between universities and business,
drawing on programs such as the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)’s secondment program between science and
the business community. At the city level, there is scope for developing the community of entrepreneurs through creating
networking spaces, accelerators, incubators and shared services facilities, and upgrading skills and attracting talent through
targeted programs.

Improve access to inance and business support services especially for MSMEs to facilitate their growth. Reforms are needed
in many areas to address the main constraints to inancing MSMEs including strengthening of comprehensive credit
information system, legal protections for banks and adequate bankruptcy and debt resolution framework to encourage
more proactive bank inancing, and better collateral registration system. There is also need to consolidate the business
support system managed by multiple agencies. A low hanging fruit is the expansion and strengthening of the network of
Go Negosyo centers, one-stop shops for business support, and upgrade the scope and quality of their services.


Strengthen cities’ role and capacity in economic development planning and implementation. Cities can play a decisive role
in promoting competitiveness, given the signiicant responsibilities decentralized to the local governments. Yet, there is lack
of enabling environment, adequate capacity and incentives for the local governments to fulill their mandates. The national
government needs to clearly delineate the roles of national and city governments for economic development, provide
incentives for local governments to collaborate at the metropolitan level and harmonize business support mechanisms
(such as registration requirements, tax regimes, etc.) to promote the development of industrial clusters, modify the structure
of Comprehensive Development Plans (CDPs) to give priority to economic development targets, and provide resources for
local governments’ capacity building. City governments should strengthen the Local Economic and Investment Oices
(LEIPOs) to identify local economic development priorities and coordinate relevant activities, and deepen the public-private
collaboration with business associations to promote economic policy reforms.


3. Promoting Inclusive Growth by Creating Opportunities for the Urban Poor


Economic Inclusion


Enhance livelihoods/jobs support for ISFs in close collaboration with the private sector. A majority of the ISFs engage in low-
paying low-skilled informal jobs due to lack of education and skills, vulnerable to external shocks that can push them below
the poverty line. There is a need to help them move up the job ladder and augment their income. Such support requires
a two-pronged approach. One for skills training and placement for formal wage employment, and the other for enterprise
development. For the former, the government should reorient the existing vocational skills training and placement programs
to a more “market demand-driven” approach, where potential employers are involved in the course design and subsidy for
initial post-placement period. For the latter, upfront support to analyze the marketability of end products or services and
end support to link the microenterprises to market need to be built in. A properly designed public works program can
also be an efective means to provide complementary income support to the unskilled poor, especially to compensate the
unstable income.


Prioritize investments in facilitating secondary education completion to improve job prospects of the poor. Completion of
high school education is critical in securing job opportunities. Support to alleviate the inancial burden of uniforms, school
supplies, education materials, and transportation costs, possibly through the ongoing conditional cash transfer (CCT), would
greatly enhance the chances of more urban poor youths to complete higher education.
            xxii                                                                              Philippines Urbanization Review




Spatial Inclusion


Provide support for afordable housing, secure tenure, and access to basic infrastructure and services. Provide support
to inance primary and secondary infrastructure development which would be undertaken under the leadership of the
local government unit (LGU) consistent with city-level planning. Tertiary infrastructure such as small-scale water supply,
drainage, sanitation, solid waste management, footpaths, ire safety measures, sidewalks and street lights are also needed.
Identiication and prioritization of tertiary infrastructure could be carried out in a community-driven manner to empower
the poor. Disaster risk reduction will be mainstreamed through design and implementation to reduce the poor’s exposure
to both natural and man-made disasters. Alternative housing support in the form of incremental housing or rental housing
should also be undertaken concurrently to maximize options.


Strengthen institutions that underpin afordable housing and inclusive urbanization. A coherent assignment of institutional
roles and functions in managing the urbanization processes at both the national and local level is absent. There is a need to
strengthen support for the LGUs. Additionally, the mandates of key shelter agencies need to be reined, and an authoritative
body that oversees overall urban development needs to be identiied or created. Finally, there is a need for continued
support to develop and implement key policy reforms in the areas of urban development planning, housing inance, land
use management and administration, disaster risk management etc.


Social Inclusion


Support communities and engage them in the local development process through citywide mapping and community-
driven slum upgrading. Beyond the needs of addressing afordable housing and secure tenure for ISFs, there is much that
can be done at the community level. It is well established that communities can be efective if empowered to undertake
planning and decision-making of their own afairs. By providing hands-on facilitation, capacity building, and engaging
them in community-driven mapping and slum upgrading, and providing opportunities to engage with LGU oicials, urban
poor communities will be empowered and social cohesion within the community will be strengthened. Increased social
cohesion can nurture mutual trust that helps mitigate crime and violence. Moreover, increased interaction between the LGU
and the communities helps generate social capital which can be harnessed by LGUs toward advancing local development
and housing initiatives.


4. Strengthening Institutions and Metropolitan Governance for Better Delivery of Infrastructure, Services
   and Resilient Urban Planning and Management


Strengthen the institutional framework for urban development through the adoption of a Philippine National Urban
Policy (NUP) and the establishment of a lead agency for urban development and housing. A comprehensive NUP for the
Philippines should deine the urban development priorities of the country, which speciies how urban development is
integrated into broader national development goals and deines a vision for the sustainable spatial expansion of urban
areas across the country. Key elements include speciication on the respective roles of the national and local governments
in the urban planning, inancing, and provision of core urban infrastructure and services. At the same time, NUP should also
                                                                                                              xxiii


provide a comprehensive urban planning framework that integrates national level development objectives and strategies
with metropolitan- and city-level land use and development plans. The NUP should provide for the establishment of a lead
agency for urban development and housing, which will be responsible for the implementation of the policy’s objectives
and priorities. Consistent with on-going policy discussions to consolidate all the key shelter agencies under one national
government agency, the lead agency should also assume full responsibility for the housing sector and be empowered to
provide capacity building, technical assistance, and policymaking support to cities and metropolitan areas.


Reform metropolitan governance arrangements in Metro Manila and in secondary urban areas. Given the strong history
of and legal protections for the local autonomy of LGUs, a renewed approach to a more efective metropolitan governance
of Metro Manila requires a balance of maintaining the local autonomy of the constituent LGUs while adopting politically
and technically feasible compromises for the more efective and eicient delivery of critical urban services. A feasible
arrangement could be one that allows territorial fragmentation but where sector-based integration overcomes it in the
performance of certain sectors, such as transportation and traic management, solid waste disposal and management,
and water and sanitation. Such an arrangement will require a shift in the role of MMDA to focus on metropolitan wide
development and land use planning and coordination. The current functions of MMDA as an implementing agency with
responsibilities for direct service provision would thus be greatly reduced, allowing it to focus on its core competencies. For
smaller metropolitan areas outside of Metro Manila, a more nuanced approach should be provided for under the proposed
NUP that allows for more lexibility and innovation.

i.    In relatively large, “fragmented” metropolitan areas, particularly Metro Cebu or Metro Angeles in Pampanga, adopting
      the same approach proposed for Metro Manila would be appropriate. Metropolitan-wide planning bodies may be
      established to coordinate inter-jurisdictional development and land use planning and to lead the coordination
      between the metropolitan area and the national government for service delivery and large-scale public infrastructure
      investments. Concurrently, metropolitan service authorities may established to deliver strategic, inter-jurisdictional
      urban services across each metropolitan area.


ii.   For smaller “spillover” metropolitan areas, a more practical approach may be to strengthen formal mechanisms and
      incentives for inter-local government coordination for spatial and land-use planning and collaboration for service
      delivery.


Improve accountability systems for local service delivery through iscal decentralization reforms. Structural reforms to
the intergovernmental iscal system of the Philippines require legislative actions and must hence be considered as part
of a long-term agenda. DILG has led comprehensive reviews of the iscal decentralization system in past but proposed
revisions to the Local Government Code (LGC) have found minimal support in Congress. Nonetheless, executive actions
of the proposed enactment of NUP and establishment of a lead agency for urban development and housing will help to
address weak systems of accountability that stem from fundamental issues in the decentralization system. Further, short-
term reforms should be pursued to support the capacity building of cities for local revenue administration and to improve
the institutional environment for debt inancing. Capacity building support and advocacy activities targeted to cities can
help to facilitate the regular updating of schedules of market values and local revenue codes, the adoption of modern tax

mapping and GIS tools, and the streamlining of business permits and licensing systems. Executive actions are also needed
to facilitate LGU borrowing, such as better coordination by Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) of the Department
of Finance and the Monetary Board to lower the bureaucratic hurdles and to shorten the processing time for LGUs to access
loans.


5. Strengthening the Land Administration and Management System to Promote City Competitiveness and
   Sustainable Urbanization


Establish a uniied land information system available to the public and streamline the institutional arrangement for LAM.
Fragmented institutional responsibilities have resulted in lack of a coherent land information system. This has led to gaps in
records, overlaps, existence of multiple titles on the same land, and spurious titles, increasing the transaction costs in securing,
registering and transferring property rights and constraining investments in property development. By consolidating land
information from all agencies concerned, an integrated system can serve as a backbone of a land tenure improvement
program and up-to-date property tax and information system. It should be supported by the development of a national
spatial data infrastructure (NSDI) or data inter-operability system that will facilitate exchange and sharing of land records
among agencies and make these more accessible to the public. Concurrently, fragmented institutional responsibilities on
LAM should be consolidated to improve eiciency in service delivery.


Develop a metropolitan-wide land use physical framework plan to optimize the beneits of agglomeration and mitigate
urban sprawl. A metropolitan- wide land use physical plan that takes into account future requirements for space, economic
activities and function is needed to guide development and improve eiciency in infrastructure and service provision
across cities. Such a plan needs to support implementation of projects aimed at maximizing the beneits of agglomeration,
especially in the areas of transport, environmental management, sewage, and other urban infrastructure. This should be
developed in a consultative manner including the private sector and citizens as they will have important roles to play in
its realization. Based on the framework plan, there should be incentives for the LGUs to update their comprehensive land
use plan (CLUPs) and Zoning Ordinances to guide spatial development in cities. The roles for projects to be implemented
by local government and those to be carried out by national government based on the framework plan should be clearly
distinguished.


Address increasing informality in major urban centers by establishing an integrated land and ISF information system and
undertake a systematic approach to tenure improvement of ISFs Given the magnitude of ISFs, it is vital that opportunities
for afordable housing and secure tenure are sustainably expanded. A program on integrated land and ISF information
systems is urgently needed, and will require dedicated funding, resources and a timetable to undertake inventory of existing
tenure status of ISFs and prepare citywide land tenure improvement plans. The designated oice would also need to take
responsibility for identifying available land for ISFs for in-city resettlement and on-site development, establish infosystem
link between government agencies and LGUs, make land information more accessible to all users, and take measures to
institutionalize land data-sharing between and among LGUs and national government agencies.A systematic or citywide
approach to tenure improvement for ISFs is also urgently needed, while piloting alternative tenure options such as usufruct,
long term leases, and land sharing. There is also a need to simplify current procedures to mobilize government lands for ISFs.
                                                                                                            xxv


Strengthen local governments’ capacity on property valuation and taxation to improve service delivery and increase
investments in vital infrastructure. Capacity building by BLGF under Department of Finance is needed for LGUs on valuation
and taxation to implement existing standards and methods. Concurrently, there is a need to develop an accurate integrated
land information system that allows LGUs to capture accurate information on land ownership, strengthen BLGF’s monitoring
of LGUs’ real property tax collection, and developing measures to ensure that LGUs regularly update their schedule of market
values – such as establishment of a National Valuation Authority which will be responsible for approving the values - so that
property tax is based on the latest market prices.


Prioritize sustainable land management and enhance resilience in urban planning. Given the potentially negative
consequences of speciic urban planning and land management decisions that can lead to congestion, pollution and high
greenhouse gas emissions, cities need to consider the trade-ofs of infrastructure investments as these are likely to be
locked in for hundreds of years. The rapid population growth particularly in unplanned or poorly planned settlements is
also contributing to growing exposure to natural hazards in cities. Enhancing city resilience as a cross cutting approach
through multi-hazard risk reduction measures, public awareness and preparedness, and risk mitigation for public facilities
(e.g. retroitting of schools, hospitals, government administrative buildings, etc.) in the Philippines is a priority for city
competitiveness and can be integrated with good urban planning and management, sectoral investments, and better
preparedness.

     Box 2.1 Urban Density and Agglomeration Economies

     Global evidence shows that density rises with the level of development, and the densest places in the world are in the richest
     countries. In 2005, Dublin, London, Paris, Singapore, and Vienna ranked at the top, with more than USD 200 million in gross
     product per square kilometer. Likewise, Tokyo-Kanagawa, New York-New Jersey, Oslo-Akershus-Vestfold, and Vienna-Mödling
     were the densest grid cells of 1° longitude by 1° latitude, generating more than USD30 million of gross product per square
     kilometer (Figure 1). 50 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP) is produced on just 1.5 percent of the world’s land, almost
     all of it in cities.




     On New York’s Wall Street and in the City of London, inancial irms, insurance companies, and banking syndicates beneit from
     being close to one another. Co-location stimulates the growth of other specialist services, such as legal, software, data processing,
     advertising, and management consulting irms. These clustered irms, by providing a thicker market for highly educated
     individuals, beneit from drawing on the same large pool of human capital. They also gain from the generation and difusion
     of knowledge amongst one another. Agglomeration efects can also occur in smaller cities with suicient specialization and
     transport linkages to larger urban areas.

     Agglomeration economies depend not just on size (a big city or industry) but also on urban interactions. They are traditionally
     classiied as localization economies arising from within-industry economic interactions, and as urbanization economies, arising
     from between-industry interactions. The reasons for producers to gain from proximity to others depend on the sharing of capital
     inputs, information, and labor. They also depend on improving the matches between production requirements and types of land,
     labor, and intermediate inputs—and learning about new techniques and products.

     Localization economies arise from a larger number of irms in the same industry and the same place. Spatial proximity helps
     because immediate access to competitors in the same sector allow irms to stay abreast of market information in negotiating with
     customers and suppliers. Clustered irms can also share a larger and more dependable pool of specialized labor.

     Urbanization economies arise from a larger number of diferent industries in the same place. A management consulting company
     can beneit from locating near business schools, inancial service providers, and manufacturers.

     below) deined on the basis of the European Urban Atlas nomenclature provides a picture of the urban growth pattern of Metro
     Manila, showing a clear densiication trend from 1990 to 2014:

     1990-2000 – conversion of 17% of very low density urban fabric directly to very high dense urban fabric;

     2000-2010 – serious densiication involving the loss of 35.54% of areas covered by low and medium density classes to higher
     density classes;

     2010-2014 – The low and medium density classes lost an important part of their surface to the beneit of higher density classes.

       employment in large cities like Seoul, Busan, and Daegu fell from 44 percent to 28 percent, while the share in small cities and rural
       areas rose from 26 percent to 42 percent. Rising labor and land costs drove labor- and land-intensive manufacturing industries out
       of central Seoul. As manufacturing’s share in employment in Seoul fell from 32 percent in 1980 to 11 percent in 2010, the share
       attributable to the service sector rose from 58 percent to 81 percent. A tax credit for manufacturing irms that moved factories from

2.3 Beneits from Urbanization are Yet to be Fully Harnessed —
    A 3D Perspective on the Key challenges

Despite the achievements highlighted above, the
economic beneits from urbanization in the Philippines
could be greater. As indicated by lower economic
growth during the urbanization process compared to
regional neighbors, the country has not beneited from
urbanization gains as much as other countries (also see
Introduction). For the period 1970 to 2006, China and India
demonstrated an average 6% increase in per capita GDP
for every 1% increase in urban population while Vietnam
and Thailand exhibited 8% and 10%, respectively; the
Philippines, however, showed less than 2% increase for
every 1% increase in urban population over the same time
period.32 Over the last 3 decades, the Philippines’ aggregate
labor productivity increased by only 10% (annual average
growth rate was only 0.3%), while that of Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Thailand more than doubled in the same
period. While the Philippines’ growth and job creation have                            Density – If Not Well Managed, High Density Generates

than moving a container within the archipelago on a
domestic carrier (e.g., Davao to Manila).44 It has limited
opportunities for urban growth and regional development,
sometimes at the expense of environmentally-constrained
areas, because of the lack of access to other areas better
suited to absorb additional or new developments. The
efective urban-industrial heartland of Luzon, for example,
has remained essentially unchanged since the late 1970s,
conined to the Angeles-Metro Manila-Batangas corridor.

the port of Batangas have extended commercial traic
but these have been exceptions. Expansion of transport
capacity along the northern and southern corridors to
northern Luzon and towards the Bicol region, respectively,
has been minimal or has even declined with respect to rail

      Box 2.4 Copenhagen 1946: A Regional Framework that Anticipated Transit-Oriented Development

      A vision depicted by a memorable analogy. The regional plan for Greater Copenhagen was
      prepared on behalf of the Danish Town and Planning Institute. Under the plan, (known as the
      Finger Plan), urban growth would be concentrated along ive corridors or “ingers” oriented
      toward historical villages in the periphery, while central Copenhagen, the palm of the hand,
      would remain the principal regional center. The “wedges” – the areas in between the “ingers”
      – were to remain as green areas. The intent of the Plan was to prevent sprawl, guiding growth
      along ingers, which would have a radial S-train line (the irst opened in 1934) running through
      them. Small independent communities of 10,000 inhabitants were planned for each “inger”
      with commercial space, schools, and other facilities built around stations, connected to the
      city core by the S-train. The regional scale was remarkable at a time when planning was not
      geared toward such cross-municipal reach. Equally remarkable is that although the Finger
      Plan was a non-binding and initially private document the government’s role was critical to
      ensuring its success. The government safeguarded the principle of coordinated land use and
      transport and ensured its application in municipal plans. It also created the conditions for
      land markets to develop along the axes established in the plan.

      A precursor of coordinated land and transport planning. The Finger Plan has guided growth
      in the Copenhagen region for more than 60 years. The use of rail infrastructure investment
      to steer growth to desired areas can be considered a precedent for TOD. During the
      1950s-1960s, the population of Greater Copenhagen doubled and the built-up area expanded
      dramatically. The principles of the Finger Plan were followed by other planning instruments,
      including the Outline Plan of 1960, which irst introduced the concept of multiple centers
      in the metropolitan area. In the 1970s, policies were included to ensure the conservation of
      the green wedges. The 1972 Structure Plan identiied four new nodal towns and the 1989
      Regional Plan reined the concept of a multi-center structure by increasing investment to link
      the nodes. The “ingers” have grown longer and wider than what was anticipated originally,
      but it has been largely successful in absorbing the growing population and continues to be
      relevant in the city’s highly functional structure today. The Danish government has been
      involved in developing a 2007 update of the Finger Plan, already enacted into a national
      directive. The principles have been incorporated into national spatial planning with local
      authorities in charge of compliance

settlement. As experienced by many developed countries
such as U.S., Japan and Republic of Korea, the largest/
primary cities tend to be more diversiied and service
oriented: they innovate, invent, breed new irms, and
expel mature industries; secondary/smaller cities tend to
be industrially specialized: they produce or manufacture
and receive relocated industries from diversiied cities (Box
2.2). Clustering of industries in secondary cites enables
cost saving for irms due to relatively cheap land and labor
and lead to “localization economies” (Box 2.1). Improved
transport infrastructure and low transport costs are
essential conditions for standardized industries to move
out of high-rent centers and cluster in smaller cities. This
is because irms can trade the high rents within the cities
for lower rents in other locations without ofsetting those
gains through higher shipping costs. Improved transport
links between cities can enable irms to access local,
regional, and global markets—both for buying inputs
and selling outputs, reinforce agglomeration efects and
generate complementary and specialized functions.

Starting a business in the Philippines is among the most
cumbersome in the world. Doing Business 2016 ranks
the country at 165 out of 189 economies on starting
a business. The average irm spends 29 days securing
licenses required to start a business and spends around
PHP 20,000 (equivalent to 16.1 percent of the country’s
per capita income). Up to 18 licenses, permits, and forms
have to be approved before a business can commence. In
addition, the Philippines still requires a relatively high paid-
in minimum capital and a minimum of ive incorporators,
a practice that many countries have abolished. In many
cases, irms report that they need to pay bribes or give
gifts to obtain various permits and government services.

      Box 3.3 BPO and Jobs in the Philippines: Opportunities and Challenges from Technological Change
      The information technology (IT) and BPO industry in the Philippines has been a driver of economic growth and job creation in the
      last decade having grown at an average of 24 percent annually. Direct employment reached 1 million full-time employees in August
      2014 from virtually zero in 1999, accounting for around 2.3 percent of the country’s total employment. The industry has a robust
      voice sector (primarily call centers), accounting for 64 percent of the industry’s revenue. Health care information management
      employment grew by 47 percent from 2012 to 2013. IT outsourcing revenues also grew by 52 percent from 2012 to 2013, while
      knowledge process outsourcing grew by 18 percent. Earnings and skill requirements vary across these sectors. Industry-speciic jobs
      tend to be higher skilled than those that cut across industries (such as human resources business processing), as they require more
      technical knowledge.

      In 2012, average annual compensation per employee in the industry was around US$8,849, with the highest average compensation
      in software development (US$17,383). It was US$8,301 for contact centers and US$7,687 for other BPOs. High-skilled, high-paid
      occupations—as are most research and development–related jobs in knowledge process outsourcing (such as market research and
      medical transcription), IT outsourcing (such as software and application maintenance), engineering services (such as engineering
      design and digital mapping), and creative processes (such as art production and game testing and support)—are intensive in no
      routine cognitive and interpersonal tasks. Middle-skilled occupations are intensive in routine cognitive tasks, mostly in non-voice
      BPO (such as back-oice inance and accounting or human resources), but can also include many of the jobs in voice business
      processing (such as customer service and technical support).

     Box 3.4 Good practice in Using ICT to Improve Urban Transport: Cases of Manila and Cebu
     Urban transport is a complex system where newly cheap information unlocks possibilities for greater eiciency. A good starting point
     is with the most basic foundation of planning: of the 25 largest low- and lower-middle-income cities, 92 percent do not have complete
     maps of their transit networks. Compiling these maps used to be time-consuming and expensive.

     Recently, though, Manila developed and applied a mobile phone–based application to survey and map routes, using an open-source
     data standard. The map powers a consumer trip-planning app and is being used by city planners to reduce redundant routes and plan
     a new mass transit corridor.

     Cebu, in turn, was able to ingest real-time taxi data to generate speed and congestion maps for the entire city. This reduced the time to
     analyze travel time for a bus corridor from two weeks to two seconds.

   Box 3.6 Assessment of the Philippines’s Research Capacity and Innovation Ecosystem
    In 2014, USAID-funded project assessed the quality of the university research and innovation ecosystem based on a survey of stakeholders.
    It found that there has been an ongoing progress in improving the research ecosystem, but also that there were substantial weaknesses
    that needed to be addressed for the innovation support system to function eiciently and produce results.

    Speciically, assessed across six pillars of the report’s deinition of an innovation ecosystem, the Philippines does relatively well on
    general education and human development, but is weak across the remaining ive pillars, including intellectual property rights, startup
    environment and social capital (see Figure below).

     Box 3.7 Examples of Local Business Support Programs: Quezon City
     In 2012, Quezon City a created Business Development and Promotion Oice and adopted a Magna Carta for Micro and Small Business
     Enterprises to provide a wide framework of policy and services support for small businesses in the city. QC also created the Sikap
     Buhay Entrepreneurship and Cooperative Oice (SBECO). The SBECO conducts business trainings and consultations for city’s small and
     medium enterprises, and assists the city in the development of an SME Roadmap to guide the SME’s plans for growth and expansion.

     SBECO manages an entrepreneurship and micro-inance program known as the Puhunan Pangkabuhayan ng Sikap Buhay (PPSB),
     which is a non-collateral interest loan facility for small entrepreneurs in partnership with several cooperatives. The program has a
     budget of around 5 million USD a year and over the last 11 years it has supported more than 64,000 entrepreneurs. SBECO partners
     with Go Negosyo centers to provide additional trainings for micro entrepreneurs. While the headline loan repayment rate of 95% seems
     impressive, the efectiveness of the program and its impact is not clear.

Involvement of the private sector can ensure much
more efective and fast competitiveness reforms in cities.
Examples from Philippines and elsewhere around the world
show that private sector can play a critical role in boosting
local competitiveness. Private associations can provide
training to entrepreneurs and potential employees, attract
investors to the city, provide services to entrepreneurs
and start-ups, lobby national government on behalf of
the city. The well-organized private sector associations
in Filipino cities have all that it takes to complement
and even drive the reform eforts of local governments.
The critical element is overcoming animosity between
public and private actors, identifying shared goals for city
development and coordinating eforts.

     used as a unit of analysis in this report. Oxford Economics data used for descriptive statistics and international benchmarking only includes Cebu City, and excludes
     Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu. For structural analysis of Metro Cebu, PSBI data aggregated from irm level for all three LGUs is used. While the PSBI sample of irms is not
     representative at the LGU level, it is still the best approximation. However the tree LGUs considered combined account for 75% of jobs in the Central Visayas region,

   Box 3.11 Business Registration Reform Options: International Best Practice
   There is a wide range of business registration reform options that are available for countries seeking to improve their business
   registration systems. These include:

   1.     Standardizing incorporation documents. Without standardized registration documents and clear guidance on how to complete
          them, the registration process can be discretionary, cumbersome, and costly and result in high rejection rates. In Estonia in 2006,
          processing time at the registry fell from 15 days to 1 with the introduction of standardized documents. Approximately 65 countries
          now have standardized incorporation forms.

   2.     Reducing or eliminating minimum capital requirements. Minimum capital requirements generally do not achieve any of their
          underlying objectives. Far from being beneicial, some studies ind that minimum capital requirements have counterproductive
          efects on entrepreneurship. Consequently, since 2005, 57 economies have reduced or eliminated this requirement.

   3.     Making the registration process transparent and accountable. The easier it is to access information about a regulation, the easier
          it will be to comply with the regulation. In more than 90 percent of high-income economies, fee schedules can be obtained from
          agency websites, notice boards, and brochures.

   4.     Integrating registration systems and introducing unique identiication. In most countries, in addition to registering with the
          business registration authority as a business entity, an entrepreneur must also obtain tax and VAT registrations from the tax
          administration, social security or pension authority, or municipal authority. A number of countries have therefore moved toward
          integrated registration systems that allow entrepreneurs to complete one application form for all authorities and introduced a
          unique identiication denomination (UID), which is then used for all transactions with the authorities.

   5.     Creating a one-stop shop. The one-stop shop (OSS) provides a single interface for business start-ups, a mechanism that has gained
          popularity in many economies. Today about 83 economies around the world have some kind of OSS for business registration,
          including 53 economies that established or improved their OSS in the past eight years.

   6.     Introducing ICT. Today, 110 economies use information and communication technology (ICT) for business registration services
          ranging from online name search to online business registration, annual returns iling, and electronic transmission. Use of ICT
          makes the registration system faster and more cost-efective, it also enhances data integrity, information security, transparency
          of the registration services.

       Box 3.13 Organizing for Economic Development

       Cities around the world have used various institutional structures to develop economic development strategies, pursue a competitiveness
       agenda, engage private sector in policy delivery and facilitate successful implementation.

       Economic Development Agencies
       Economic development agencies (DAs) can be deined as, “legal, non-proit structures, generally owned by the public and private entities
       of the territory”.66 DAs are usually given a range of clearly deined functions that may include branding and international promotion;
       investment attraction and retention; business start-ups and growth; human capital development; real estate, urban and infrastructural
       development; social or green development initiatives and others. DAs are accountable to a group of actors that is broader than the city
       government. DAs help establish economic development at the key objective for the city and attract private sector talent and knowhow to
       carrying out economic development functions. Economic development agencies have proven themselves eicient at delivering trans-
       formative change. Barcelona Activa (the economic development agency of Barcelona Municipality) helps set up over 700 companies
       employing over 1500 a year. New York Economic Development Corporation activities have facilitated $22.9 million of private investment
       in 2008 alone.67

       Delivery Units
       Delivery Units (DUs) are implementation structures established at the center of government in order to drive improvements in perfor-
       mance. DUs have a mandate to use the authority of the chief executive—the center of government—to lead “the political and technical
       coordination of government actions, strategic planning, monitoring of performance and implementation, and communication of the
       government’s decisions and achievements.”68 Such units usually do not have a narrowly deined focus, rather they are given authority to
       deliver on a set of priority targets or indicators. DUs help design clear responsibility and accountability structures, and link diferent public
       sector interventions to the key development priorities through transparent monitoring and evaluation and improved coordination. DUs
       have a potential to drive innovation and eiciency improvements in policy implementation. Baltimore’s CitiStat has changed the perfor-
       mance paradigm in the city governance by introducing clearer performance objective, a robust monitoring system and a performance
       based budgeting system.

       Public-Private Boards for Economic Development
       Public-private boards serve as a platform for information sharing and consultation, but depending on the context they can have a strong
       inluence in deining development priorities and implementation.69 Additionally public-private boards can help surpass the geographic
       or functional limitations of typical local government agencies. Experience of Local Enterprise Partnerships in the UK reveals that while
       this units can be very eicient at leading and coordinating local economic development eforts, in other cases they can fail lack of clearly
       deined purpose, shortage of resources and leadership.70

Today, half of the Philippine’s population lives in cities.
The proportion will continue to increase to reach 84% by
2050.126 Philippine cities generate 70% of the GDP, of which
36% is generated in Metro Manila alone.127 Urbanization
has often helped reduce poverty by providing new job
opportunities and raising incomes of the poor. Indeed,
poverty incidence for urban areas (12.5%) was less than
half of the national poverty incidence (25.2%) in 2012.128


Yet as cities fail to keep pace with the rapid urbanization in
the Philippines, multi-dimensional poverty in urban areas
is deepening and widening. With in-migration of those
aspiring for better lives from rural areas to urban centers
came surges in demand for jobs, housing, infrastructure
and basic services in major cities. Yet, the Government
has been unable to address the increased demand given
the accelerated pace. The result has been proliferation of

    barangay is afected by illegal drug activities --slightly afected, moderately afected, and seriously afected. Barangays are considered slightly afected if there are identiied drug users in the community but no known drug pushers or
    traickers are operating in the area while moderately afected if at least a suspected drug pusher or traicker is operating in the barangay. A barangay is seriously zafected if at least a drug laboratory, den, dive or resort is suspected to
    exist in the community.

Spatial Exclusion

Urban poor sufer from inadequate access to land,
afordable housing, basic services, and are vulnerable
to hazards. Given the magnitude of ISFs, it is vital that
opportunities for afordable housing and secure tenure are
sustainably expanded, and key services and infrastructure

interventions are proposed.


Close the gap in afordable housing and provide access to
basic services for the ISFs.


Housing is a basic human right as recognized in the

Strengthen Institutions that Underpin Afordable
Housing and Inclusive Urbanization


A coherent assignment of institutional roles and functions
in managing the urbanization processes at both the
national and local level is absent. Local Government Code
(LGC) and Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA)
spell out that LGUs have the primary responsibility for
providing housing assistance and conducting an inventory
of lands to identify sites for social housing. Yet multiple
responsibilities coupled with limited land and institutional
capacity, made more pronounced by their dependence on
national government for logistics and inances, overburden
a majority of them. Hence LGU constituents, most of all
the ISFs wanting to be engaged in their development
process, ind diiculty accessing technical and logistical
support from government.225 Concrete cases would
                                                                                       Social Inclusion
show nonetheless that when given technical support,
LGUs are able to efectively carry out their planning
roles as demonstrated by initiatives such as the Citywide                              Identify and Design Appropriate Interventions

229 Metropolitan fragmentation describes the transition from “contained” urban areas, where the built up area is contained within a single municipal boundary, to
     “spillover” and “fragmented” urban areas (World Bank 2015). For “spillover” urban areas, one jurisdiction contains more than 50 percent of the total built up area while
     the remaining urban area is divided among smaller jurisdictions (e.g., Hangzhou in China, Nha Trang in Vietnam, and Bandung in Indonesia). For “fragmented” urban
     areas, no jurisdiction accounts for more than half of the built-up area (e.g., Jakarta, Tokyo, and the Pearl River Delta urban area in China).

Increasing mismatches between socio-economic
(functional) areas and administrative (spatial) jurisdictions
within rapidly expanding urban areas require efective
governance solutions at the metropolitan level that are
currently missing in the Philippines.The efective and eicient
provision of core urban services with metropolitan-wide
dimensions requires formal and functional mechanisms for
efective inter-jurisdictional coordination. Cost eiciencies
rooted in leveraging economies of scale in the delivery of
urban services represent a primary motivation for adopting
a metropolitan-wide governance structure. For capital-
intensive services such as transport infrastructure, solid
waste disposal, water supply, and sewerage, the cost per
unit of providing services tends to decrease as the quantity
of the service provide increases (Bahl 2013). The need to
manage externalities among certain urban services within
a metropolitan area, whereby the beneits or costs of a
speciic service in one jurisdiction spill over to the residents
of another jurisdiction, is another reason to consider the           However, with the exception of Metro Manila, there are

    Box 5.1 Guiding Principles for the Development of a National Urban Policy
    The development of an NUP must be responsive to the national context and sensitive to the political culture and dynamics in a country.
    While global experience indicates that there is no single model or approach guaranteed to produce a desirable outcome that can
    be replicated in diferent situations, there are several key lessons and principles that emerge from global experiences. Firstly, it is
    imperative that central governments recognize the unique threats and opportunities from rapid urban growth and understand that
    the complex challenges faced by cities cannot be solved by spatially blind sectoral policies.

    Secondly, a political champion for the urban agenda can have diferent institutional locations, and there is no perfect model. Whatever
    structure is created has to be able to win support across diferent departments to ensure that suicient resources of all kinds are
    mobilized to make a diference. Any structure also requires leaders who believe in the urban agenda and who are capable of persuading
    others to support the case – building a coalition of interests. Without high-level political support and vision, an NUP may achieve little
    in practice because of inertia and resistance to change.

    Thirdly, implementing an NUP means a sustained technical process of building the legal foundations, institutional capabilities,
    administrative procedure and inancial instruments to pursue this agenda efectively. A NUP may also need aspects of established
    legislation (such as old land-use planning regulations and laws governing the ownership, use, and development of land) to be altered
    so that it is more relevant to contemporary conditions and better equipped to deal with growing informality.

    Fourthly, the proactive engagement of cities is critical to achieve national urban policy goals. Efectively implementing an NUP requires
    strong partnerships among national and sub-national governments as well as the decentralization of selected powers, responsibilities,
    and resources to city and metropolitan-level institutions.

    Box 5.2 Examples of National Urban Policies
    South Korea’s NUP has evolved through three phases. The irst involved explicit spatial concentration and sectoral focus because
    resource limitations prevented spreading investment more evenly across the country. The country’s rapid socio-economic development
    is attributable in large part to an industrial modernization strategy pursued by the government from the 1960s to the 1980s, geared
    largely to boosting exports. Due growth pressures and high infrastructure costs, the government sought to de-concentrate jobs and
    people away from the Capital Area in the 1980s and 1990s to pursue “balanced territorial development.” Finally, growth demands and
    inlated house prices in the Capital Area forced the government to respond by constructing ive additional new cities around Seoul in
    order to relieve the housing shortages, accompanied by a massive increase in apartment building. The government’s housing program
    was accompanied by a policy to relax government controls on mortgage lending by inancial institutions, allowing more people to
    aford home ownership. Both initiatives contributed to a dramatic increase in the supply of housing over a relatively short period.

    During the 2000s, South Korea’s NUP shifted again towards trying to improve the quality of urban development, including livability,
    amenities, safety and environmental quality. This was partly a response to the previous emphasis on quantitative economic growth
    and the resulting inferior character of the built environment in many urban areas. One of the main lessons emerging from South
    Korea’s experience is the importance of aligning territorial planning, urban policy, housing programs and the provision of land for
    development. This example demonstrates the substantial beneits that can be derived if urban policy reinforces and contributes to
    economic development, with suicient land and housing made available in the right places.

    Following the adoption of the 1988 Constitution, which included a chapter on urban policy, Brazil enacted a law called the Statute of
    the City in 2001 to promote equity and access to urban land. The law facilitated more democratic city management by making land-
    use planning mandatory throughout each city and subjecting development decisions to social control and participation. Furthermore,
    the law ensured that the social function of urban land and buildings was put before their commercial value by removing part of the
    land from the market. Urban planning has henceforth been seen as a collaborative process of shared decision-making and negotiation
    among diferent interests, rather than a top-down, technocratic activity undertaken by government experts, private developers or
    commercial investors.

    Colombia is a highly urbanized (75-80 per cent) country that has gradually developed a NUP to match the scale of its urban challenges.
    Two successive national development plans have set clear priorities for urban development. These are relected in the 2005 “Livable
    Cities” Strategy, which focused on improving access to afordable land and housing, increasing water and sanitation services, and
    improving public transport. The strategy was reinforced when government responded to the global inancial crisis with a major program
    of public investment to enable the construction of a million houses over a ive-year period, starting in 2011. Additional reforms sought
    to develop new and innovative ways to inance urban infrastructure, such as public-private partnerships. Colombia has also learned
    from Brazil’s Constitution and urban laws by taking steps to facilitate more efective land readjustment and redevelopment. Special
    Zones of Social Interest were established to reduce the legal minimum plot size for houses and allow informal settlers to regularize
    dwelling conditions with less threat of speculation and eviction.

    Australia’s irst broad-based NUP was approved in 2011 following a period of extensive research and consultation. It was a response to
    a series of looming challenges in the major cities, including the escalating cost of housing, rising fuel costs, urban sprawl and its impact
    on infrastructure networks, transport systems, road congestion, uneven access to job opportunities and the natural environment.
    National government involvement was vital because of the limited iscal capacity of the states and local government. The NUP sought
    to address the broader issues of managing the big cities better, improving their contribution to national economic performance,
    and reducing their carbon emissions. It had four pillars - productivity, sustainability, livability and governance. A novel feature of the
    NUP was the clear rationale established for the national government to get directly involved in a way that went well beyond that of a
    single, stand-alone department or spending program, as in the previous urban initiatives. Coordination went to the heart of the NUP in
    order to ensure a wide-ranging, sustained impact on mainstream government policy, in particular to ensure that urban infrastructure
    considerations became a more important feature of the government’s agenda. This was achieved by setting up an elaborate architecture
    for institutional alignment across key departments and agencies, including special committees and reporting arrangements.

    Ghana is an example of a country that has prioritized the adoption of its NUP as its urban population has grown beyond 50 percent.
    After a four-year period of technical analysis, policy reviews, workshops and extensive domestic and international consultation, the irst
    ever NUP was launched in March 2013, along with a ive-year detailed Action Plan. The preparatory work included a public advocacy
    campaign to make the case for better-managed urbanization. The broad aim of the NUP is to promote sustainable, spatially integrated
    and orderly development of urban settlements, with adequate housing and services, and eicient institutions. Extensive investment in
    urban infrastructure funded by national government and managed by municipalities is intended to alleviate severe congestion in the
    big cities and create a sound living and working environment to accelerate the country’s all-round development. The implementation
    of the NUP is supposed to be coordinated by the Urban Development Unit within the Department of Local Government and Rural
    Development; however, there are no institutional mechanisms in place to encourage other government departments to follow the
    NUP. Consequently, the NUP at present is a coherent policy without an institution to implement it efectively. National and local forums
    have been set up to put urban issues on the agenda of other departments and external stakeholders but it is too soon to assess their
    efectiveness.

Box 5.3 Overview of Intergovernmental Transfers

Internal Revenue Allotment. The Local Government Code institutionalized the internal revenue allotment (IRA), which is the primary transfer of
shared revenues from the national government to LGUs. The Code mandates that 40 percent of national internal revenues based on the collections of
the third iscal year preceding the current iscal year shall be allotted to LGUs. The IRA is irst subdivided among the diferent levels of LGUs using the
following distribution: provinces (23 percent), cities (23 percent), municipalities (34 percent), and barangays (20 percent). The shares for each level
of LGU are then allocated horizontal for provinces, cities and municipalities based on the following formula: population (50 percent), land area (25
percent), and equal sharing (25 percent). For barangays, the horizontal sharing is based on: population (60 percent) and equal sharing (40 percent).

The IRA is an unconditional block grant that is automatically released to the LGUs ive days after the end of each quarter. The LGC provides conditions
for the national government to withhold a portion of the IRA during periods of national iscal distress, although these cases have been very rare and
there have been such cases in the past 15 years. The key restriction imposed by the LGC is for LGUs to set aside 20 percent of their IRA allocation for
a local development fund.

The IRA represents the primary source of income for the vast majority of LGUs (see Table 5.2). However, the current formula does a poor job of
compensating for the varying levels of iscal capacities across LGUs, often worsening the horizontal resource imbalances across LGUs. (Manasan,
2007). The data shows that on average the IRA distribution to the provinces is highly regressive, allowing those provinces with the highest own-
source revenues to receive three times more IRA than those with the least own-source revenues. The distribution becomes somewhat less regressive
for municipalities and progressive for cities.

Non-IRA Transfers: LGUs also beneit from ad hoc grants from national government agencies, legislative funds, and foreign donors and creditors to
support various local services. While these non-IRA transfers are cumulatively much smaller in scale compared to the IRA, there is no consolidated
central tracking of data available that can be used to estimate the scale and distribution of such transfers. A study conducted to analyze the quantity
and composition of non-IRA transfers to LGUs in 2003 estimated that the aggregate total for these transfers was equivalent to over 20 percent of the
total IRA transfer for that year. The largest component of this total, comprising 61 percent, was funded by Priority Development Assistance Funds
(PDAF) of legislators and the funds were mainly used to inance local infrastructure. However, the PDAF was declared unconstitutional in 2013 and
has been discontinued beginning in iscal year 2014. There is generally less transparency in the non-IRA funding systems, which has adverse efects
on LGU planning and budgeting, and less information available for these miscellaneous transfers.

In the past ive years (2011-2016), reforms were initiated by key oversight national government agencies that have attempted to utilize additional
iscal transfers to LGUs as leverage to strengthen both supply-side and demand-side systems for local government accountability and created a space
for genuine participation in municipal and city planning.

•     Through the Performance Challenge Fund (PCF), DILG provides small capital grants as incentives for LGUs that meet minimum standards in
      transparency and inancial accountability (through the annual assessment of a “Seal of Good Financial Housekeeping”).

•     On a much larger scale, the Bottom-Up Budgeting (BUB) program was jointly developed by DBM, DILG, NAPC, and DSWD to facilitate poverty
      reduction by providing funding for local poverty reduction programs of LGUs that are conditioned on an annual participatory planning process
      where municipal and city governments identify priority poverty reduction projects jointly with local civil society organizations, leading to the
      development of annual Poverty Reduction Action Plans that are funded by transfers. The program was piloted in April 2012 in 600 cities and
      municipalities with high concentrations of poverty. The program has been scaled up since to cover 1,590 LGUs as of 2016 (covering all LGUs
      in the country except for those in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao), with an annual budget allocation of approximately PhP 24
      billion, which is equivalent to 5.5 percent of the IRA allocation for 2016.

respectively) (Social Weather Station 2012). Collectively,
these indings suggest that the IRA and other national
assistance appear to provide suicient resources for many
LGUs to provide a minimum level of service without having
to optimize local revenue bases.


In general, land management issues and weak technical
capacity at the LGU level are also additional constraints
to maximizing real property tax collections. The complex
structure of local business taxes also constrains the local tax
administration capacity of LGUs (Manasan and Avila 2014).
The resistance to update schedules of market values and
local revenue codes is also attributed to political resistance
from constituents and the fear of losing residents and               roles in the provision of sub-national infrastructure and
businesses to other jurisdictions due to tax competition.            services, creating a complex institutional environment

    Box 5.4 DILG Performance Monitoring of LGUs

     Since the mid-2000s, DILG has maintained the Local Government Performance Management System (LGPMS), a web-based system
     comprised of numerous indicators to help LGUs assess their capabilities and performance in the delivery of essential services.
     However, LGPMS is severely constrained by the fact that it is a self-administered tool, wherein the data entered is generated by
     the LGU itself, and access to its database is strictly restricted to the LGUs and DILG, which prevents the public from accessing and
     scrutinizing the data (World Bank 2012).

     More recently, DILG introduced the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG), which recognizes exemplary LGU performance based on
     an assessment of basic inputs and outputs for six broad areas: inancial management and transparency, disaster preparedness, social
     protection, peace and order, environmental management, and business friendliness. The SGLG signals an increasing focus on the part
     of DILG to monitor local service delivery, however the initiative is still in the incipient stage (the irst set of awardees were announced
     at the end of 2015) and DILG has not made the raw data used in the assessments available to the public.

    Box 5.5 What Explains the Low Level of LGU Indebtedness?
    Local governments in the Philippines are light borrowers and appear to restrict lending to relatively small projects or to meeting
    occasional cash low needs. Several factors explain the smaller borrowing appetite of LGUs:

    •      Limited functions assigned to LGUs that require infrastructure spending notwithstanding the local autonomy and devolution
           introduced by the Local Government Code.

    •      Continuing major role of the central government in the delivery and inance of local services.

    •      Signiicant institutional and managerial barriers to planning and managing major projects.

    •      Reluctance of local governments to borrow due to natural conservatism and also partly to congressional allocations (“pork
           barrel”) that have historically substituted as source of inancing for small projects.

    •      Poorer LGUs having a low iscal capacity to leverage borrowing.

    •      Impact of various inancial oversight mechanisms that constrain LGU borrowing.

    •      The policy framework for inter-jurisdictional collaboration is inadequate in terms of deining the juridical personality of
           the inter-LGU grouping in accessing the credit market, which efectively constrains the ability of LGUs to take advantage of
           economies of scale needed for large infrastructure investments.

mayors are members of the Metro Manila Council, the

can be rejected if individual mayors do not approve it. This

Consistent with global experiences, the efective
development and implementation requires strong
partnerships between national and local governments as
well as the private sector and civil society. Given the relative
indiference of past administrations to comprehensive
urban development issues, it is critical that at the initial
stage, strong advocacy and information dissemination
activities are undertaken to build the necessary political
support for prioritizing and pursuing a comprehensive
NUP for the Philippines. Importantly, a push to enact
an NUP would be strongly aligned with the new
administration’s broader push for deeper devolution (in
the context of a shift to a federal system of government) as

     Box 5.6 Examples of National Urban Development Agencies
     Brazil’s Ministry of Cities is responsible for urban development policy and sectoral policies for housing, sanitation and urban
     transportation. In January 2003, the Brazilian government created the Ministry of Cities with the objective of formulating national
     housing, environmental sanitation, and urban mobility policies that have a strong impact in urban development. The National
     Secretary of Transportation and Urban Mobility was created and the Brazilian Urban Train Company, which was part of the Ministry
     of Transportation, and the National Traic Department, which was part of the Ministry of Justice, were incorporated by the Ministry
     of Cities to elaborate and implement urban mobility policy. The Ministry of Cities is charged with designing and implementing a
     national policy to upgrade informal and precarious settlements in conjunction with state and municipal governments, which are
     responsible for its execution. The Ministry of Cities is also tasked with strengthening municipal capabilities and a National Council of
     Cities engages diverse stakeholders in discussing national urban policy.


     In Chile, in the early 1960s, there were at least 28 institutions and eight diferent departments that intervened in matters of housing,
     urbanization, and equipment. To deal with this situation, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning was created in 1965 with the
     goal of improving and renewing the deteriorated areas of cities through rehabilitation and urban development programs. Among the
     priorities of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning is to address issues of urban equality, combat spatial segregation, and ensure
     that all residents beneit from the city, especially the most vulnerable. The ministry expanded programs to improve neighborhoods
     and condominiums, promoted a new program focused on interventions on small towns, and invested in infrastructure – all with a
     strategic vision and relevance to Chile’s distinct regions.


     In Colombia, a national Ministry of Housing, City and Territory was formed in 2011 and was tasked with the responsibilities for
     formulating, implementing, and orienting housing policy, urban planning, and water and sanitation services, particularly in the major
     cities. Prior to this, urban and housing issues were subsumed under a broader mandate of the Ministry of the Environment, Housing
     and Territorial Development. With the establishment of a separate Ministry of Housing, City, and Territory, the national government
     now has a focal agency responsible for housing and urban development issues, including disaster risk management.


     The Ministry of Urban Development is the apex authority of Government of India at the national level to formulate policies and
     programs and to coordinate the activities of various central ministries, state governments, and other nodal authorities concerning all
     the issues of urban development in the country. The Ministry was attached on and of with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty

Box 5.7 Global Approaches to Metropolitan Governance
A common institutional approach in response to the challenge of metropolitan-wide governance has been simply to maintain
jurisdictional fragmentation. In such cases, multiple jurisdictions function within a metropolitan area with some level of autonomy
(Bahl 2013).

•    In a one-tier fragmented government model, a metropolitan area has a number of autonomous local government units
     responsible for delivering services within their own boundaries, which often leads to poor coordination among the various
     government units for critical metropolitan-wide issues such as economic development, environmental quality, social and
     spatial disparities, and the level of service delivery (Slack 2007). Jurisdictional fragmentation is prevalent in the United States,
     where there is a strong desire for local autonomy, and generally describes the metropolitan governance models of Mumbai and
     Sao Paulo.

•    Horizontal cooperation among local governments (which may take the form of case-by-case joint initiatives; contracting among
     local governments; and ad hoc committees, commissions, working groups, and consultative platforms) is a common approach
     to mitigate coordination issues within jurisdictionally fragmented metropolitan areas (Andersson 2014). However, voluntary
     cooperation is contingent on policy-makers of the various local governments having shared policy objectives. In cases where
     there are diverse objectives and motivations among local governments within a metropolitan area, voluntary cooperation is
     unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the challenges confronted by metropolitan areas (such as traic
     congestion, pollution, global competition, and iscal disparities) the required solutions are likely to require a more permanent
     institutional status. (Slack 2007).

An alternative metropolitan governance structure is functional fragmentation, wherein the delivery of a single service or cluster
of services is assigned to an autonomous agency (Bahl 2013). This approach may result in technical and cost eiciencies in service
delivery because the autonomous agency would be able to specialize on a particular service while potentially leveraging economies
of scale in providing services across a wider spatial jurisdiction.

•    The public service enterprise may take the form of a metropolitan-wide/regional authority or a special purpose district and, as is
     frequently the case in the United States as well as in the cities of Bangkok and Buenos Aires, diferent autonomous agencies may
     be established to deliver diferent urban services within a metropolitan area. Since it is unlikely that the spillover boundaries
     are uniform across diferent services (e.g., a regional transit authority may have a diferent spatial coverage than a solid waste
     management district), the advantage of such autonomous entities is that the externalities for each service can be addressed
     on an individual basis (Slack 2007). However, while there are economic eiciencies to be gained from pursuing metropolitan-
     wide authorities, this approach has also been criticized for reducing citizen control and local accountability for service delivery
     given that these autonomous entities are generally not directly under the control of any single local jurisdiction. Further, when
     independent special purpose bodies proliferate within a metropolitan area, it may become diicult to coordinate interrelated
     activities among them and to mitigate tradeofs between competing investments and policies among sectors (e.g., transit
     infrastructure and water and sewer infrastructure).

A more comprehensive governance structure is a metropolitan government where urban services are administered on a metropolitan-
wide area (Bahl 2013).

•    Under a one-tier consolidated model, urban service delivery over an entire urban area is consolidated under a single
     metropolitan government, which allows it to leverage economies of scale and to internalize externalities to a greater degree
     compared to fragmented metropolitan governance structures. Such a structure also provides more potential for equalizing
     disparities in service delivery throughout the metropolitan area. Large single-tier governments have been created through
     the amalgamation of multiple local governments within an existing region or the annexation of a jurisdiction (or a portion of
     a jurisdiction) by an adjacent jurisdiction (Slack 2007). A diverse range of metropolitan areas has adopted this model globally,
     including Toronto, Shanghai, Cape Town, and Abidjan (Andersson 2014).

•    Another model of metropolitan government is a two-tier model where an upper-tier metropolitan body provides region-wide
     services while lower-tier jurisdictions are maintained to provide services of a local nature, such as local parks and amenities
     (Slack 2007). In such a model, the upper tier assumes responsibility for services that beneit from economies of scale, generate
     externalities, and are redistributive in nature. Examples of metropolitan areas that utilize this approach are Tokyo, Madrid,
     Istanbul, and Portland (Andersson 2014).

Given the strong history of and legal protections for the                    amalgamation of metropolitan functions within the MMDA

constituent LGUs while adopting politically and technically                  Hence, the efort to determine the “appropriate” model
feasible compromises for the more efective and eicient                       for Metro Manila must account for the distinct political
delivery of critical urban services. It is unrealistic to expect             and institutional context of Metro Manila as well as the
that the LGC can be revised to reduce the local autonomy                     technical and administrative constraints that MMDA has

     Box 5.8 Key Issues in Metropolitan Governance
     While there is a wide range of experience globally in attempting to deal with the challenges of metropolitan fragmentation, there
     is no consensus on a single “best” approach for governing metropolitan areas. As Bahl, Linn, and Wetzel (2013) observe, “the great
     variation in practice that exists among developing countries suggests that almost any arrangement can work, if ‘work’ means that
     local services do not collapse.” Indeed, the key lesson from international experience is that the “appropriate” metropolitan governance
     model depends on national and local context (Slack 2007), including the strength of the desire for local autonomy vs. more eiciency
     in service delivery.

     A metropolitan government model where urban services are administered on a metropolitan-wide area would, in principle, be the
     ideal solution. However, in the context of developing countries, the option to adopt a comprehensive metropolitan-wide governance
     model is likely to be unrealistic because of rapid population growth, scarce resources, and the reluctance of central government to
     shift away from iscal centralization (Bahl, Linn and Wetzel 2013). Even in cases of metropolitan consolidation in developed countries,
     the resulting metropolitan governments typically do not cover the entire metropolitan region (OECD 2006). For developing countries
     that are rapidly urbanizing, economic boundaries will continue to expand over time making it inevitable that even consolidated cities
     would still need to coordinate services such as transportation and economic development with neighboring municipalities (Slack
     2007).

     Voluntary cooperation for the provision of some services may be more achievable than a full-scale metropolitan government in
     circumstances where a metropolitan area is too big to be acceptable as a political or administrative unit or where local autonomy is
     paramount and prevents a consolidation (Slack 2007). In such cases, politics are more likely to dictate outcomes than eiciency or
     equity considerations. However, these approaches generally do not work well when objectives difer among local governments nor
     do they provide the needed regional foundation for metropolitan areas to coordinate service delivery.

     In many cases, adopting a metropolitan-wide/regional authority or a special purpose district to deliver diferent urban services
     within a metropolitan area may be a more politically and technically feasible compromise for a metropolitan region. In designing
     such arrangements, a key consideration is the need to balance between the potentials for economies of scale, externalities, and
     service coordination eiciency with the impact on residents’ access to their government and its responsiveness and accountability
     (Andersson 2014). Also, each urban service will likely achieve the lowest per-unit cost at a diferent scale of production, potentially
     leading to variations in the boundaries of diferent services (Slack 2007).

     While there is no single solution that is right for all countries, addressing governance issues of metropolitan fragmentation must begin
     with the central government taking a metropolitan-wide view of reform (Bahl, Linn and Wetzel 2013). Ultimately, central governments
     raise most of the tax money, spend the largest share of the public budget, and make rules on how sub-national governments operate.
     Hence, the road to better metropolitan governance and iscal outcomes in metropolitan areas begins with national governments,
     which must consider that constantly changing conditions (such population growth, economic globalization, and climate change)
     demand a continuous evolution of metropolitan governance arrangements over time (Slack 2007, Yaro and Ronderos 2011).

If MMDA is converted into metropolitan-wide development
and land use planning and coordination body, the Metro
Manila Council should continue to serve as the governing
body but its membership should be expanded to include
voting representatives from the national agencies with
corresponding responsibilities, as well as private sector
and civil society organizations. Currently, the Metro Manila
Council places the decisions about metropolitan issues
in the hands of elected representatives from individual
localities and the MMDA Chairman, who is a Presidential
appointee and, historically, has usually been a career
politician. The recommendation is to open the voting

      Box 6.1 Deinitions
     Land administration is the processes of determining, recording and disseminating information about the tenure, value
     and use of land when implementing land management policies. These involve regulating land and property development
     and the use and conservation of land, the gathering of revenues from the land through sales, leasing and taxation, and
     the resolving of conlicts concerning the ownership and use of land (Dale and McLaughlin, 1999; UN ECE, 1996).

     Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good efect. It covers all activities concerned
     with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. It can
     include farming, mineral extraction, property and estate management, and the physical planning of towns and the
     countryside (UN-ECE, 1996).

         Box 6.2 Examples of Land Administration and Management Deiciencies on urbanization
         In a high proile case involving several upscale subdivisions in Quezon City, investigations are ongoing regarding a dispute with
         the landowners claiming to have the mother title to these properties.241 Similarly, there have been cases of duplicate and fake
         reconstituted titles issued after a ire at the Register of Deeds. At the National Government Center in Quezon City and nearby
         barangays occupied by informal settler families (ISFs), land syndicates exist, making misrepresentations about the property owner
         and exacting payments from poor communities for the right to stay.

         In Mandaue City, the ire that gutted the Registry of Deeds has resulted in thousands of lost title records, and owners are now only
         relying on tax declarations as proof of ownership. The cost of reconstitution is high ranging from Php 50,000 to Php 100,000 per
         parcel depending on the value, which is way beyond the afordability levels of most landowners. As a rapidly developing city, land
         transactions are based on tax declarations, with the new owners shouldering the cost of reconstitution, which could take months
         or years to complete. This deprives the original owners the beneit of exacting current market values for their properties, and also
         result in delays and additional costs in property development.

         In Cagayan de Oro city, a national developer is facing legal challenges after a claimant of Spanish title surfaced after the company
         started land development for a middle class subdivision. There are areas which are the subject of two surveys approved separately
         by LRA and DENR. There are also reported cases of multiple titles (certiicate of land ownership awards, Free Patent, and transfer
         certiicate of title ) issued on the same parcel. Based on estimates of the City Assessor, about 3-5% of prime lands are problematic
         (interviews with City Oicials). Issues like these delay development, and could cause costly legal battles, if not resolved. Based on
         interviews with Brokers and Property Appraisers, large developers would go to great lengths at validating the reliability of records,
         by tracing back the origin of titles and ownership to three past previous owners, as well as the origin of the title from the approved
         subdivision plans.

         In Cebu City, the city government has put on hold its plans to develop part of the reclaimed property called the Campana Maritima
         because of the objection iled by the Cebu Ports Authority (CPA) claiming that they should have the right to the property. The
         property is located right at the back of the City Hall oices, near the 300-hectare South Road Properties (SRP). Its commercial value
         has increased following recent developments in the SRP, where mixed-use developments are ongoing. While both the CPA and City
         Government are interested in the development of the property as a maritime heritage museum, developments cannot proceed
         due to the ongoing dispute. A good portion of the property is now being used as a parking space – which is not an eicient use of
         this highly valuable land in the City center.242

         At some point, the Philippine Exporters Confederation, Inc. of Cebu has suggested the temporary use of a portion of Campana
         Maritima to ease the port congestion in Cebu International Port (CIP). The situation has delayed shipments, with an estimated loss
         of USD 15,000 per shipment.243

6.2.2 Outdated and Inefective Land Use Planning and
      Regulations and Weak Implementation

Land use plans provide a set of rules concerning land
use and directly afect land value, which is related to its
development potential. Land use is intertwined with
land property rights as the latter relect the right to
extract the value of the land based on how land can be
used in economically productive and socially acceptable
manner244.


Efective land use plans support eicient urban activities,
facilitate livability of the urban environment, and direct
overall city development. In the Philippines, LGUs are

6.2.3 Increasing Informality in Major Urban Centers

The growth of ISFs in Metro Manila and major urban centers
has partly been the consequence of inadequate LAM
system, weak planning and ad hoc spatial development. For
the period 2007-2011, the growth rate of ISFs reached 7.3
percent, consisting of more than half a million households,
representing a quarter of the Metro Manila population.

245 For example, among REGALA LGUs, a Tax Impact Study was conducted to determine the potential efects of updated values on RPT payments to property owners
     of diferent property classes. The results were used to develop various options for assessment so that owners of low-end properties do not necessarily share the
     bulk of the tax burden. In the end, the choice is left to the cities and stakeholders to determine the best combination of assessment levels that will help achieve the
     budgetary goals of the city, and yet is more equitable. Public support is also important, and this was sought by identifying the major programs where the proceeds

    Box 6.4 Improving Land Administration Quality in Republic of Korea

    In the Republic of Korea, lack of accurate spatial information on land undermined the ability to implement urban plans and to capture
    for public beneit some of the gains from enormous land value increases associated with rapid urbanization and industrialization.
    This led to formulation of a national master plan for GIS development, followed by open and interoperable standards to govern
    production and sharing of information, simpliication of land use regulations that were too complex to be implemented transparently,
    and institutional change to eliminate duplication and include other players such as the Ministry of Justice. In view of high costs (about
    USD 415 million), implementation was sequenced to start in large and medium cities where demand was strong and the potential
    beneits highest. While meticulous checking of all the country’s 37 million land plots required a huge commitment of human capital,
    the resulting system now provides the basis for all urban planning, land administration, public land management, valuation and
    taxation, and zoning in development planning. It substantially reduced corruption and increased transparency of processes. For
    the 2007–11 period alone, an annual cost savings of about US$200 million was realized. The Republic of Korea is now expanding
    service delivery, while adapting to the growing use of mobile devices by clients, and integrating land administration in the overall
    e-governance program to better serve the business community and promote economic development.

    Category 1 - Incremental Servicing as a Key Strategy

    Similar to Cordoba and Brasilia, the Philippines can adopt the incremental servicing scheme as a holistic strategy for slum upgrading
    within the context of urban development. Applied in the Philippine context, these could be used in idle lands, forfeited properties
    resulting from auction of delinquent properties, or in government owned lands that are occupied by ISF.

    Tenure security in this sense is undertaken as part of the package of urban development, similar to the Sites and Services Improvement
    program, and the Zonal Improvement Program. These are also consistent with the UDHA and the Urban Land Reform Law. This would
    require strong partnerships between the LGUs, NHA and the HOAs, in order to deliver services in an incremental manner, and to allow
    also the incremental housing development. Flexibility in the implementation of BP 220 is therefore key, as well as the combined efort
    of LGUs in service provision, and the SHFC, LGUs and other sectors in inancing.

    Category 2 - Instruments which can contribute to improvement of existing tenure arrangements.

    These represent those where similar features exist in the Philippines, but which can be improved based on good practices ofered by
    the experiences of other countries:


    Communal Tenancy (Colombia) and Setting up of Community Land Trust (Kenya)
    The existing CMP can be improved by having an intermediary, such as an NGO or a HOA federation to set up a CLT to buy and develop
    properties into socialized housing units for low income dwellers. This is currently practiced by such NGOs as Gawad Kalinga and
    HABITAT for Humanity. This would spare the HOA or community organization from the diiculties associated with going through the
    complexities of acquisition, subdivision planning and other bureaucratic procedures to avail of funds and individualize the parcel.
    This process however, could be long and would therefore require commitment to see through its completion.

    Right now, the CAs/HOAs are left to themselves to understand the intricacies of land research, negotiations, and putting together all
    the requirements for loan approval and eventual subdivision. In the absence of an NGO, this role can be done by the SHFC, provided
    it considers broadening its mandate as facilitator for development of ISF communities.


    Private land rental schemes (Anticreto of Bolivia and Private Land Market of Thailand)
    Although temporary, securing formal lease agreements with owners of privately held properties could provide relief from the
    constant danger of eviction. These leases however, should be registered with the LGU in order to protect both parties, and ensure
    compliance with conditions.

    The lease agreements can serve as interim instrument in the meantime that negotiations with the owner and processing of loan
    applications are being worked out.


    Fixed Period State Grant (Botswana)
    This is similar to usufruct, except that unlike the certiicates of ownership (COR) that is associated with FPSG, usufructs cannot be
    mortgaged or used to apply for loans. Moreover, the COR is just a temporary tenure instrument that can mature into FPSG. The FPSG
    is then registered with the local registry, which provides an added form of security to the holders.

    This scheme remains an option open to LGUs and NHA provided these are applied on government owned lands, and/or the
    government does not want to give up the ownership of property.


    Urban Housing Permit (Burkina Faso)
    This is similar to the Certiicate of Land Allocation (CELA), which was issued as a form of interim tenure to occupants of publicly
    owned A and D lands provided they meet the minimum conditions. This form of instrument or CELA, can provide security of tenure
    in the meantime that the occupant has not yet fully satisied the conditions required for the title to be issued – such as the 10 year
    possession.

    To be a stronger instrument however, this needs to be recorded and registered at the DENR, LGU and RoD.

Category 3 - Instruments that are worth testing given existing policies

This set of instruments pertain to those that have potential to improve schemes where there are existing policies, but implementing
procedures are largely undeveloped. These would require pilot testing and then preparation of detailed guidelines based on
experience.


Zona Especial de Interesse Social (ZEIS) and Concession of the Real Right to Use (CRRU) in in Brazil)
Special land development and regulations can be applied by LGUs in areas identiied in APDs. Since there are no available tenure
instruments that can be given to occupants of APDs similar to the CRRU of Brazil, the LGU can provide temporary administrative
recognition thru certiicates of occupancy, in the meantime that acquisition of privately owned portions of APDs are being worked
out. In case the APD falls on government lands, the NHA can apply for Proclamation or the LGU may apply for Special Patent, and then
the properties can be disposed to occupants either through usufructs or individual titles.


Housing cooperatives in South Africa
The strength of the cooperative law can be tested to develop housing cooperatives to secure titles and mobilize land. Existing HOAs
can be transformed into coops provided there is joint interest to set up the entity. For the members, this could mean having their
own investments in property development, which they can recover once they have the means to move out of the coop once their
socio economic conditions improve. The combined support of CDA, NGOs, HOAs, LGUs and shelter agencies would be essential to
pilot such a scheme.


Land Readjustment in Benin
This is similar to the reblocking scheme applied in on site development, except that under reblocking, there is minimal dislocation;
and that under land readjustment, the resulting lay out and plan is more structured and conforms better to standards and provision
for service areas.

This would require however, high level of commitment of the individual households and trust in the resulting land readjustment
scheme. Furthermore, support from the government (LGU or NHA) should be forthcoming to facilitate surveys and development
of facilities and service areas for the communities. The advantage is that the resulting lay out blends better with the urban fabric,
reducing the extent of blight.

In the same vein, the operative law would be PD 1517, except that there have been no example to speak of, nor implementing rules
developed for this purpose.

   Annex Box 1 The City Wedge Framework

   “City wedge” analysis helps identify the capacity of the city to design and implement             Figure 1 The City Wedge Framework
   competitiveness policies. The extent to which cities can efect private sector development
   conditions varies a lot from city to city. At the highest level this can be illustrated through
   diferences in resources available to cities in diferent countries: for instance in China
   cities account for 50% on public sector expenditure, while in Mexico they only account
   for 7%. However the availability of inancial resources is not the only factor that deine
   the leverage that cities have over the conditions that drive competitiveness “City Wedge”
   helps identify the advantage a speciic city has over its development fundamentals. It help
   understand how city can grow it’s leverage and identify the policies that are realistic for
   cities within its current mandate and capacity.

   “City Wedge” encompasses three elements: public-private growth coalitions, city
   government mandate and capacity, and inter-governmental networks. Grouping
   various initiatives, this way enables city leaders to understand the levers for economic
   development at their disposal. How a city uses these levers can vary depending on
   circumstances. The key is to utilize all three points of leverage to, open opportunities and      Source: Gashi D. Atkins J. (2015) A user’s guide to Implementing City
   avenues to strengthen cooperation in achieving common goals and tackling common                   Competitivenss interventions
   problems:

   •      Public-private growth coalitions refers to collaboration between public sector agencies and diverse external stakeholders,
          including civil society, in planning and implementing interventions to foster improvements to the business climate and the
          strategic visioning of economic development. Public private dialogue (PPD) is one approach to structuring such public-private
          interactions (Sivaev and others 2015, 4, 6).

   •      City government refers to a city government’s ability to impact economic development, which depends on its legal mandate as
          well as inancial autonomy, and capacity in terms of human resources and internal management processes. (Figure 1)

   •      Inter-governmental networks refer to the interdependent relationship cities have with national and regional governments in
          pursuing economic development. A city’s public and private sector leaders often need to leverage the support of higher-tiers of
          government or neighboring jurisdictions to approve or inance major infrastructure projects. Cities can beneit from nationally
          sponsored initiatives. Moreover, cities collaborate with diferent regions to strengthen economic linkages and collaborate in
          complementary industrial sectors.
