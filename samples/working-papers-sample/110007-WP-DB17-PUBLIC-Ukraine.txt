This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      signatures of company’s authorized officials, but also the seal.

      Certificates and applications that are signed by a company’s official but
      not sealed are still considered by state authorities as not trustworthy
      unless they have been signed in front of a state official. Among the
      exceptions are tax records, as tax authorities accept them in paper form
      without the seal if a signee marks the record with “w/s” (“without seal”).

      Open a permanent bank account

      According to the regulation № 212 of the National bank of Ukraine "On
      Alteration to some regulation acts of the National bank of Ukraine"
      dated June 06, 2013, the list of required documents for opening of the
      bank account for the Legal Entity is as follows:
      a) bank signature specimen card certified by a notary is replaced by
      card with samples of signature and imprint of seal;
      b) the copy of extract from Unified State registrar of Entities and
      Entrepreneurs needs to be presented
      (http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z1121-13);
      c) an application for opening a bank account and
      d) a notarized copy of the legal entity's charter.

      In case a limited liability company did not open a bank account prior to
      the state registration of a limited liability company, the bank, Pursuant
      to the Tax Code, must notify the tax inspection about the account
      opening within 1 business day after the account opening. Within three
      business days after receiving a notification from the bank, the tax             1 day        no charge

      inspection must notify the bank on registration of the account or about
      refusal to register the account. In practice, notification of the tax
      inspection by bank and receiving answer from the tax inspection takes
      1-2 business days.

      A limited liability company may use its account for outflow operations
      only after the bank receives notification from the tax inspection on
      registration of the respective account.

      According to the Tax Code Amendments and the Notification Order,
      the bank shall notify the Ministry of Duties and Revenues of Ukraine via
      Internet about the account opening within 1 business day. After
      receiving the electronic notification through the Internet portal, a local

      the Kiev City Council for the final approval. The implementation
      of the relevant practice of issuing city planning conditions and
      restrictions to developers has already started in Kiev. Upon
      obtaining of the city planning conditions and restrictions, the
      developer should apply for the technical conditions.

      These include the data on engineering and utility servicing of the
      to-be constructed property (the warehouse), including the
      sources of supply, connection points as well as the basic
      engineering parameters of the property.

      The city planning conditions and restrictions as well as the
      technical conditions are valid until completion of construction,
      but for the term not less than 2 and not longer than 5 years and
      they can be extended at the request of the developer. The
      design assignment should comply with the city planning
      conditions and terms and refine the benchmark for design, with
      account for the specific features of the project. The design
      assignment is developed and approved by the developer and is
      provided to the general designer for the project.

      construction budget (4% for residential buildings), excluding
      expenses related to obtaining the land plot for construction,

      communications.
      • If technical terms and conditions establish need for building
      new utility facilities outside of the land plot, the amount of
      contribution payment should be decreased by the cost of such
      expenses.
      • Contribution payment should not be charged for rendering
      services, performing of works or transferring of any assets for
      benefits of local authorities.

      The Decision of Kyiv City Council, dated December 302012
      No.573/5385 stipulates special conditions for calculating
      contribution payment in paragraph 6.1:

      B o b = n j * s * k, where:
      B ob - the amount of share participation developer (investor) for
      the construction project in the j-industry and national economic
      complex of the city;
      nj - standard amount of share participation developers
      (investors) in the creation of social, engineering and transport
      infrastructure of the city of Kiev with the assessment of the
      socio-economic value of construction projects for the city in the
      j-industry and national economic complex, their function;
      s - the total area of the object for which the contribution rate is
      determined;
      k - summarizing the correction factor.
      Generalizing the correction factor (k) is calculated for the
      following formula:
      from k = kz * I i, wherein
      kz - zonal coefficient;
      I i - an index that takes into account inflation since 01.01.2009
      before the month in which the calculation is carried out.

      It should be noted that the standard unit of investor
      participation in the construction of a warehouse in the tables in
      Appendix 16 is not defined. This structure can be regarded as
      "other non-residential premises" in the table. 2, for which the
      norm is 45.6 USD per 1 m. m total area, or "other production
      areas" in the table. 3, for which the standard 54.4 USD per 1 m.
      of the total area.

      Zonal coefficient depending on the area of construction as
      shown in Table 4 will be from 1 to 2.5 (areas where, in practice,
      are built warehouses), however, coefficient 2 would be most
      likely for the areas where warehouses are built.

      Inflation index since 2009 (according to the State Statistics
      Committee) is 132.

      The amount of share participation in the construction of a
      warehouse area of 1,300.6 square meters will be: B ob = 54.4 *

      1300.6 * 1.32 * 2 = 186,787.

      However, since this amount exceeds the 10% of the construction
      value, the contribution would be limited to 10% of the
      warehouse value.

        The issuance of the ownership certificate and the registration of
        ownership rights are done with the same authority, during one
        single procedure. Effective January 1, 2013, the procedure for
        property registration was changed due to amendments to the
        Law “On State Registration of Property Rights to Real Estate and
        Their Encumbrances” as of July 1st 2004 No. 1952-VI. By this

        Submit application to Kievenergo and await technical conditions

        The customer submits to Kievenergo an application for an electricity
        connection. Attached to the application the customer has to submit a
        number of documents: a letter with a company seal requesting the
        connection, bank details of the applicant, company statute, registration
        certificate from the tax authorities, registration certificate of the
        company, certificate stating that the company is included in the national
        company registry, document stating the appointment of the CEO,
        property ownership certificate and location plan of the property to be
        connected. After reviewing the application Kievenergo issues technical
   1    conditions. The technical conditions concern only the external             30 calendar days            UAH 0
        connection. In general they may include instructions for construction of
        a new substation; lining of high-voltage and low-voltage cables; in a case
        of reconstruction works - participation of the subscriber in the given
        actions.



        The application for technical conditions is submitted to the Department
        of Development (департамент перспективного развития) at
        Kievenergo which is then internally passed on to the Regional Office in
        the particular area of Kiev where the warehouse is located and the
        regional office determines the point of connection. Technicians in the

      Regional offices know the network and the substations in their area very
      well and usually do not need to visit the site for preparation of technical
      conditions. At this point the connection contract is concluded which
      outlines the responsibilities between the customer and the utility.

      Await project design of external connection by private firm and its
      approval

      Once the technical conditions are issued the customer hires a licensed
      project design company to prepare the electrical project design of the
      external connection. As part of the project design the company prepares
      a topogeodesic plan (топогеодезическую съемку М 1:500). The
      topogeodosic plan is prepared to determine the technical aspects of
      running cable through the landscape.

      While the project is being developed the approval of the location of the
      substation connection to the network and/or the route of the cable 10
      kV and 0.4 kV has to be obtained from Kievenergo and from the Main
      Architectural Planning Organization. At this point the customer should
      have an operation permit for the warehouse or Main Plan with the
      Landscape Allocation Plan. The approvals are obtained by the project
      design firm.

      Considering the load (140 kW) when receiving an approval of the project
      of external connection from Kievenergo it is required to attach the
      project of the internal wiring of the warehouse which at this point should
2     be approved as part of the general architectural design of the             90 calendar days     UAH 41,900

        Conclude supply contract with Kievenergo (Energosbyt)

        Before turning on the power, the customer has to first conclude a supply
        contract with Kievenergo (Energosbyt). The supply contract can be
        concluded only after all the inspections are completed.

        The documents for the supply contract can be presented in the office or
   4    sent by mail. It is required to submit a number of documents regarding       20 calendar days        UAH 0
        internal wiring including a Technical Report of the tests of the internal
        wiring which should be completed after the internal wiring was finished

        Request and receive turn-on of power by Kievenergo

        Once supply agreement is concluded, the customer can visit the
        dispatcher department of Kievenergo and request power turn on. The
        dispatcher department processes the order which permits it to turn off

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      Starting from January 01, 2016 registration of ownership rights for seller

      land or be two separate agreements: the sale of building (warehouse)

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                            such proceedings, because it would be more interested in recovering its loan

                           Mirage's solvency can be restored and restructured during the reorganization
                           proceedings. As a result, the commercial court will announce Mirage bankrupt

To make the data comparable across economies, several

used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
