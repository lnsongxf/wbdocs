Executive Summary
Romania is the fastest growing economy in the EU, and Bucharest and Romania’s secondary
cities have been its main growth engines. However, while Bucharest has reached productivity
levels comparable to those of other EU capitals, secondary cities in Romania still have some ways to
go before competing on equal footing with secondary cities in the EU. Without strengthening these
secondary cities, the Romanian economy cannot sustain growth in the coming years.

The most competitive secondary cities are those that are most astute at attracting people,
investments, and tourists. This report looks at the cities that have been most successful at
attracting migrants and commuters, and proposes a number of recommendations aimed at making
secondary cities more attractive and competitive. In what follows we will discuss the key findings
and proposals of the report.



Key Findings
While not all Romanian cities are dynamic economic hubs, most have witnessed a development
dynamic in the past years that goes beyond their administrative boundaries – they are
basically part of functional urban areas. It is these functional urban areas where most of the
population growth has happened in Romania in the past years. The functional urban zones (FUAs)
of Bucharest and the 40 county capitals in Romania generate 90% of national firm revenues, amass
80% of the people with higher education, have attracted 67% of commuters in 2011, and 66% of
migrants between 2001 and 2011, amass 61% of overall employment and 58% of the total population
of the country.

The most dynamic cities attracted labor force from quite a distance, and the localities with
a more mobile population tended to be more developed than the localities with a less mobile
population. In essence, development spills over from the most dynamic cities to the surrounding
areas, and this is a key dynamic of the development process. Without strong cities, one cannot have
strong regions and a strong national economy. The FUAs of the county capitals, generate between
69% and 89% of firm output in their respective regions, and they register an average Local Human
Development Index score that is between 10% and 24% higher than the regional average.

In 2011, only 31% of the stable population in Romania (around 6.2 million people) changed
their residence inside the country at least once during their life time. However, Romania

                                                                                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - xi
                        has one of the highest emigration rates in the EU. Key features of in-country migrants to the FUAs
                        of Bucharest and the 40 county capitals include: 1) 57% are female; 2) 51% came from a different
                        county, although not from a very distant one; 3) 67.5% moved to an urban area; 4) 50% moved from
                        rural to urban areas, but there is a growing share of urban to urban migration; 5) 60% of migrants
                        are over 45 years of age; 6) 58% moved for personal reasons (e.g. marriage), 21% moved for work,
                        and 13% moved for studies; 7) 23% have tertiary studies and 34% have upper secondary studies; 8)
                        47% are employed, while 33% are retired; 9) 55% are qualified workers, generally requiring secondary
                        education, while 28% are managers and professionals with higher education; 10) 58% work in the
                        services sector, 23% in industry, 12% in agriculture.

                        Overall, 1.8 million Romanians were commuting for work to another locality in 2011, country-
                        wide. Of those, 1.2 million commuted to the FUAs of Bucharest and the 40 county capitals.
                        Key features of commuters to the FUAs of Bucharest and the 40 county capitals include: 1) 61% are
                        male; 2) young people (less than 35 years) are more mobile and are willing to travel longer distances;
                        3) 62% come from rural areas; 4) 26% have tertiary education, although only 18% of jobs commuters
                        occupy require tertiary education; 5) 58% have completed a form of secondary education; 6) 56%
                        are working in services sectors; 7) the share of blue-collar commuters had decreased from 45% in
                        2002 to 15% in 2011; 8) the automotive industry is most dependent on commuters (46% of the total
                        labor force).

                        Large industrial centers, such as Ploiești and Pitești receive more commuters, while service
                        driven economies, such as Cluj-Napoca and Iași, receive more migrants. This is a dynamic that
                        makes intuitive sense, and a dynamic that has important implications for local administrations.
                        Basically, manufacturing centers will sooner or later face limits to growth, as salary growth in these
                        sectors cannot outpace the growth in the cost of living in these cities. On the other hand, high value-
                        added services sectors can sustain salary growth more easily and they encourage salary growth in
                        all other sectors too1. That is why cities with a strong high value-added services base (usually the
                        larger university centers) are more attractive to migrants. Nonetheless, it seems there is a strong
                        link between the growth in the number of jobs and a growth in commuting, indicating that urban
                        economic growth is inherently metropolitan economic growth, requiring the proper interventions and
                        assistance from the local, county, national, and EU level.

                        Overall, one can say that migration and commuting are probably the most accurate
                        indicators of territorial competitiveness. The reasons that people chose to move to a city are
                        varied and multifaceted, varying from job and education opportunities, to personal reasons (e.g. for
                        marriage), and to reasons that have to do with quality of life, shopping options, cultural and arts
                        scene, the presence of like-minded people, or the proper climate. The cities, or rather the functional
                        urban areas that manage to attract the most people, are usually those that have managed to offer
                        the widest menu of things people are looking for. Thus, the number of people that willingly migrate
                        and commute to a certain area, represent one of the most important measures of success for that
                        particular area.

                        Migration to major cities in Romania has been a few orders of magnitude higher between
                        2001 and 2011 (a decade of fast economic growth) than in all the previous decades. In
                        dynamic functional urban zones such as Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, or Iași, over 35% of all migrants
                        made the move between 2001 and 2011. This hints to a reshuffling of urban dynamics, after years
                        of central planning, and empirical data does indeed show that these three cities are widening their
                        area of influence (see map below), and are the most likely candidates for strongest secondary cities
                        in Romania.

xII - MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Dominant migration catchment areas for the largest regional centers, between 2001 and 2011




Data Source: Romanian National Institute of Statistics


Although central planners attempted to have a balanced territorial development, they seem
to have achieved the opposite effect. Migration data shows that Bucharest clearly dominated
migration flows before 1989. In the years of rapid economic growth (2001-2011), regional centers
such as Cluj-Napoca and Iași have become more prominent, and regional influence areas seem to be
more balanced. As urban centers such as Constanța, Brașov, or Craiova will become stronger, the
territorial influence areas are likely to be even more balanced. Ploiești will likely be part of the largest
urban agglomeration in Romania – that of Bucharest.
         	
Migration and commuting are not only spurred by economic growth, but they are also critical
to the development process. As an economy enters an expansion phase, it is critical that resources,
including human resources, are allocated efficiently where they are most needed. The more mobile
people are, the better off the economy is. To encourage migration and commuting, cities have to
offer something that people need, want, or desire, and public authorities have to provide the policies
and infrastructure that makes the movement of people as seamless as possible.
         	
The factors that make a particular FUA attractive to people are not always under the control
of local authorities, and often times they are a matter of path dependency. Nonetheless, local
authorities have a number of tools to their disposal to help make their cities more attractive. Some
of the factors that have helped some Romanian cities become more competitive include:

          1.	 Size. The bigger you are the bigger gravitational pool you tend to have. Larger cities in
              Romania have by-and-large managed to attract more people. Bucharest, as the primate
              city in Romania, has been, and will likely remain the main attraction hub in Romania.
              When it comes to commuting, the strength of the private sector has also played a role.
              Thus, relatively smaller FUAs like Pitești and Ploiești, have attracted the highest number
              of commuters after Bucharest, largely because of the strong automotive industry in the
              first case, and the large oil refineries in the second case.
          	
                                                                                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - xiIi
                           2.	 Proximity to density. Cities that are close to larger cities tend to initially lose out in the
                               economic growth game (although suburbs and peri-urban localities thrive), as qualified
                               people migrate to the larger city in search of better opportunities. As the “economic cup”
                               of the larger city fills up (i.e. as costs go up in the larger city), benefits start to spill over
                               back to the smaller cities. This is what happened in Romania too, with growth poles like
                               Ploiești, Brașov, Constanța, or Craiova being in the sphere of influence of Bucharest, and
                               initially losing out to the capital. Now, as costs and salaries in Bucharest have grown a
                               lot, more and more investments go to the cities around Bucharest.
                           	
                           3.	 Proximity to the West. The closer cities are to the Western border of Romania (where
                               70% of exports go through), the better off they tend to be. Proximity to markets matters.
                               Thus, smaller, but strategically located FUAs, such as Oradea, Arad, or Sibiu, have been
                               among the top performers in recent years, both in terms of economic growth and in the
                               numbers of people they have managed to attract.
                           	
                           4.	 Universities. By-and-large, the FUAs with the strongest universities have also been
                               the most successful at attracting people. Universities offer a unique advantage to the
                               FUAs that house them. They bring in a continuous and constant supply of young and
                               well educated people, which, when matched with the proper job opportunities, make
                               for a successful recipe. Many of the students that graduate from these universities
                               decide to stay in the FUA if the appropriate job opportunities are available, and
                               having such an in-flow of young and qualified people is critical for Romanian cities –
                               particularly in an environment of overall demographic decline.
                           	
                           5.	 Economic make-up. Cities with a higher share of high value-added sectors fared
                               better than cities with a low share of such sectors. As cities grow, so does the cost
                               of living, and without economic sectors that can afford to grow salaries continuously,
                               the city eventually hits a growth block. That is why there are, arguably, not a lot of
                               manufacturing metropolises in the World. Overall, the cities with a higher share of high
                               value-added services sectors, did better than the ones with a stronger manufacturing
                               base. Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Iași have therefore the strongest prospects for
                               sustained future growth. Obviously, strong universities are critical to attracting
                               high value-added service industries, as they supply these industries with the needed
                               qualified labor forces.
                           	
                           6.	 Quality of Life. While quality of life is a luxury many local administrations cannot
                               afford to pay attention to, many people care about it – particularly the most qualified
                               people, which have the highest mobility and can chose between many different cities.
                               Cities with an active civil society, a good night life, and plenty of opportunities to
                               spend free time, will generally do better than cities without such amenities. To most
                               people, quality of life means other like-minded people. Thus, qualified people usually
                               move to places with a lot of other qualified people. This is the best way they can get
                               better at what they do.
                           	
                   A few caveats are also worth noting here:
                           	
                           a)	 Regional catchment areas. With the exception of Bucharest, which has a national
                               reach, and maybe with the exception of Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Iași, which manage
                               to attract people from other urban centers, most FUAs in Romania have a limited reach.
                               This means that they primarily attract migrants and commuters from a close-by area,
                               so the qualifications of their migrants and commuters are usually not better than the
                               general qualifications of the people in the region.
                           	
                           b)	 Success does not come without cost. The FUAs that are most successful in attracting
                               people, also witness a general increase in living costs, with negative side-effects for
                               people that don’t benefit from high value-added sectors.

        MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
        c)	 Commuter figures imply both a push and a pull factor. While many commuters
            are attracted to a city because of the opportunities it offers, a significant share of
            commuters also represent people that moved outside the core city while continuing
            to work in the city. The reasons people move and subsequently commute are manifold
            – e.g. high cost of living in the core city; poor quality of services in the core city; the
            need for more spacious housing units; poor spatial planning. This is a dynamic that
            needs to be well understood and properly unpacked when devising local/metropolitan
            policies and interventions. For example, the development of very good metropolitan road
            infrastructure, may encourage a suburbanization process, pushing people outside core
            cities into the suburbs and peri-urban areas.




Key Proposals
While geography, path dependency, and sheer luck play a role in a city’s competitiveness,
public authorities, and the actions that they take, also play an important role. If
infrastructure interventions and public policies are properly dispatched they can have a significant
impact. Good connective infrastructure can enable easier access to markets, better mobility, and a
better allocation of resources. Investments in quality of life can make cities more attractive, while
integrated metropolitan planning can remove barriers for new housing and business developments.
In what follows we will discuss some of the key interventions that could be undertaken by the EU,
the National Government, and local/regional administrations. These are interventions that can help
strengthen FUAs in Romania, and make them more competitive – both internally and externally. We
will focus only on the measures considered to have the most significant impact. A more detailed list
of recommendations is available later in the report.



Possible EU Interventions
The EU’s focus on Sustainable Urban Development for the 2014-2020 Programming Period,
and the introduction of the Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) tool, represent important
steps in the right direction – what is lacking is the proper dosage. More specifically, for the
2014-2020 Programming Period, the EU required Member States to allocate 5% of ERDF funds for
Sustainable Urban Development activities. The required share allocation is much too small given
the critical importance of cities in the growth and development of countries. Ideally, a larger ERDF
allocation should go to urban and metropolitan development activities. Similarly, the use of the ITI
tool was used differently by different Member States. Poland, for example, chose to use ITI for 18 of
its metropolitan areas, whereas Romania chose to only use it for the Danube Delta Region. Romania
has instead decided to have a dedicate axis under the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020,
with dedicated funding for the 40 county capitals, which will be discussed in more detail in this
report.

Key interventions that could be taken into consideration for the 2021-2027 Cohesion Policy
include:

        1.	 Large infrastructure interventions for metropolitan areas (e.g. connective
            infrastructure, environmental interventions, business infrastructure). While urban
            development dynamics are metropolitan in nature, local administrations often lack the
            means and/or willingness to finalize interventions at the metropolitan level. As such,
            it is important to provide both the incentives and resources required to strengthen
            metropolitan areas.

                                                                                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - xV
                                   	
                                   2.	 Local infrastructure interventions along the lines of what has already been financed
                                       in the 2007-2013 Programming Period, and what will be financed in 2014-2020
                                       Programming Period – e.g. rehabilitation/modernization/creation of public spaces;
                                       rehabilitation of historic buildings; rehabilitation/modernization of apartment block
                                       neighborhoods and the public spaces in and around the apartment blocks; creation/
                                       modernization/rehabilitation of green spaces; extension/modernization/rehabilitation
                                       of pedestrian and bike infrastructure; extension/modernization/rehabilitation of
                                       metropolitan public transport infrastructure; targeted interventions for urban
                                       marginalized communities.
                                   	
                                   3.	 Human capital interventions that can help cities be better prepared for the
                                       economy of tomorrow. Such interventions could include: on-the-job training programs;
                                       international scholarships for university students; internship programs; twinning
                                       programs for professors, private companies, and NGOs; translation of the latest scientific
                                       advancements in the West; open knowledge repositories for public administrations.
                                   		
                                   4.	 Competitiveness interventions targeting Romanian FUAs, such as: access to internet
                                       infrastructure for everybody; revolving fund for start-ups and SMEs; incubators for start-
                                       ups.



                         Possible National Interventions
                         Romania does not have a clear Urban Development Policy, nor does it have a dedicate state-
                         budget funded investment program targeting urban areas. The National Territorial Development
                         Strategy provides a welcome step in the right direction, acknowledging the role cities play in national
                         economic growth and development, but there is no clear national policy targeting cities, metropolitan
                         areas, or functional urban areas. Some major lines of action the National Government could consider
                         include:

                                   1)	 The elaboration of a National Urban Development Policy, which can
                                        identify the major challenges Romanian cities face, and ways in which the Central
                                        Government can help them overcome these challenges.

                                   2)	 The introduction of a metropolitan investment program, financed from
                                        the state-budget, which can complement EU-funded programs and help urban areas in
                                        Romania respond to distinct challenges they face (e.g. the development of metropolitan
                                        transport infrastructure; the introduction of metropolitan public transport systems;
                                        investments in metropolitan business infrastructure; or the creation of metropolitan
                                        green and/or recreational spaces).

                                   3)	 Legislative framework for metropolitan areas, which can enable and
                                        encourage metropolitan governance, management, and development.

                                   4)	 The elaboration of national standards and tools that can help local
                                        authorities raise their capacity and effectiveness in implementing integrated urban
                                        development programs (e.g. guides for the urban regeneration of apartment block
                                        neighborhoods).

Possible Local Interventions
While the EU and the National Government play a significant role in helping make Romanian
cities more competitive, it is local administrations that have the biggest levers to make
their cities more attractive and competitive. The range of interventions and policies they can
undertake is quite large. We include here some of the interventions that we consider most important:

        1)	 Strengthening the local private sector, by attracting investments (both
            foreign and national), by encouraging local entrepreneurship, and by enabling access
            to national and foreign markets. Without a strong private sector, no amount of public
            infrastructure will make a city more attractive to people.

        2)	 Improving the quality of life, to make the city more attractive to a wide
            spectrum of people, by investing in public spaces and sustainable transport modes, by
            improving the quality, efficiency, and reach of public transport networks, by undertaking
            ambitious urban regeneration programs in apartment block neighborhoods, by creating
            and extending green areas and parks, by encouraging cultural and artistic events, and
            by strategically responding to parking challenges.

        3)	 Fostering partnership with a wide range of private and public stakeholders, to
            better respond to challenges that a local administration cannot as efficiently tackle on
            its own.

        4)	 Investing in education, to ensure that the locality’s most prized asset, its
            people, are adequately prepared to meet new and complex development challenges.
            Well qualified people are a critical asset for local administrations that hope to attract
            investments.

This work builds on an excellent body of work on internal and external migration in
Romania2. Romanian and foreign researchers have periodically analyzed migration flows and their
dynamics, and have also looked in-depth at external migration dynamics, which for Romania are
very important. We have, therefore, also included a chapter on external migration, as it provides an
important backdrop to the analysis of in-country migration. Between 1990 and 2011, over 1.8 million
people have migrated to one of the 41 FUAs analyzed in this report. However, 3 million people have
chosen to migrate abroad. Policies that are geared towards strengthening Romanian FUAs could
potentially help re-direct some of these outward flows inwardly.




This work is the first of its kind focusing squarely on
migration and commuting patterns to the largest urban
centers in Romania. The work was made possible by the
rich and enlarged data sets that are now collected by
the Romanian National Institute of Statistics. We are
thankful we were able to use this large database. We hope
this work will be useful both for policy makers and private
sector representatives.

                                                                                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - xVII
xVI I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Analytical
FRAMEWORK




             1
                This report is primarily addressed to policy makers and to a lay audience interested in
                urban development issues. As such, the report aims to achieve several key desiderates: 1) to bring
                evidence that cities are critical for economic growth and development; 2) to argue that the number
                of people a city manages to attract (through in-migration and commuting) is one the most important
                indicators of the city’s competitiveness; 3) to analyze migration and commuter patterns in Romania,
                and identify the cities most successful in attracting migrants and commuters; 4) to try to determine
                why some cities are more successful than others in attracting migrants and commuters; and, finally,
                5) to propose measures that could help make these urban areas more attractive and competitive.

                The report is part of a larger “Lagging Regions” initiative, undertaken by the World Bank,
                to better understand how lagging regions in the EU could respond to development challenges
                they face. DG Regio has identified two types of lagging regions in the EU: 1) low-income regions (i.e.
                those with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below 50% of the EU average); and, 2) low-growth regions (i.e.
                regions that have not managed to converge to the EU average in the past 10 years). The Bank’s
                “Lagging Regions” initiative pursues several strands of analysis, such as: a re-framing of “lagging
                regions” around a different set of indicators; an analysis of financial instruments that could be used
                to complement EU grants; an analysis of how regions could improve the business environment to
                becomes more attractive to private investors, while spurring local entrepreneurship; an analysis of
                key ingredients that encourage better EU funds absorption. This analysis focuses primarily on the
                role cities, or rather the role of functional urban areas in driving regional growth and development,
                and ways in which these functional areas could be strengthened.

                The report tries to answer three key questions: 1) What role can secondary cities (as growth
                poles) play in supporting the growth of lagging regions (or mitigating their decline); 2) Which
                secondary cities stand the best chance to pull their region’s economy upward, and what can
                be done to help them; 3) What can be done to strengthen these secondary cities. Data on
                economic performance, migration, and commuting will be used to help answer those questions.

                Evidence in the report will show that cities matter for economic growth – they matter a lot.
                It is usually a relatively small number of cities that generate an overwhelming share of economic
                output and growth. In the EU, 28 primate cities generate around 23% of the EU GDP (and only
                amass 7.8% of EU’s population), while 228 secondary cities are responsible for 40% of GDP (and 15%
                of the total EU population). These are the main economic engines of the EU, and the better they
                function, the better does the economy of the EU as a whole.

                This pattern holds even when looking at individual countries, regardless their level of
                development. Thus, in all EU countries, from the most developed (e.g. Germany, France, the UK)
                to the least developed (e.g. Romania, Bulgaria), primate and secondary cities amass somewhere
                between 10%-30% of the total population, and generate around 50%-70% of GDP. When the larger
                functional urban zones of these cities are taken into consideration, the picture is even starker. For
                example, in Romania, the functional urban zones of Bucharest and the 40 county capitals generate
                90% of firm revenues in the country.

                Cities, and their functional urban areas, are also critical for regional performance, and
                particularly for the performance of lagging regions. The most performing regions rely on one or
                more urban area(s) to sustain economic growth. And given that primate cities are, or are surrounded
                by leading regions, in every EU country, it is secondary cities that play a particularly important role
                in the performance of EU’s lagging regions.

                Primate cities are the first beneficiaries of development. In virtually every country around the
                globe, it is the primate city (the largest urban center) that reaps the first benefits of development.
                Economic output in primate cities tends to grow faster than in all other regions. Historical data also
                shows that primate cities are relatively rigid in their leading position. New York was the largest city in
                the US in 1790, with a population of only 33,000, and it remains the main population and economic
                center in the US today.

2 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Secondary cities are however a country’s source of dynamism and they are critical for an
improved performance of the national economy, and an improved performance of regional
economies. GDP per Capita (PPS) data for EU countries shows that while primate cities in New EU
Member States have productivity levels that rival those of primate cities in Old EU Member States,
secondary cities in New EU Member Countries have a significant productivity lag when compared
with secondary cities in Old EU member Countries. It is these secondary cities that hold the key to
development for developing countries.

Knowing which secondary cities stand the best chance to become national and regional
economic growth engines, can help improve development policies and public investments.
For example, while urban development patterns are metropolitan in nature (in Romania, 47% of
migrants to the main functional urban zones, settled in suburban areas not the core city), few local
authorities have the resources and/or leverage to undertake metropolitan projects (i.e. projects that
cross several administrative boundaries).

Migration and commuter data are good proxies for identifying the most successful secondary
cities and for identifying the policies that can catalyze growth and development in these
cities. The decision to move to a particular place is multi-faceted. People don’t only move for jobs
or higher salaries, but also for better education, better healthcare, better quality of life, or for other
people. Migration data nicely captures this cumulus of factors and provides important insights
on which cities can function as regional growth engines. The cities that are most successful at
attracting people are usually also the top regional economic performers. In turn, commuter data
provides insights about metropolitan dynamics, and can help with the adoption of the right policies
and public investments.



    The report is structured along four main sections:

            An analysis of development dynamics, with a particular focus on the importance of cities in driving
     1      growth and development.

     2      An analysis of migration and commuter patterns in Romania.

            An analysis of the cities and areas that have been most successful at attracting people, and an
     3      analysis of the urban areas that will likely attract most people in the future.

            Recommendations on how EU, national, and local policies and investments can help make secondary
     4      cities more competitive.



The focus of the analysis will be on Bucharest and the 40 county capitals in the country. The
county capitals have been chosen by the Romanian Government as main recipients of Sustainable Urban
Development funds, from the European Regional Development Fund for the 2014-2020 Programming
Period. The recommendations in this report can thus help improve the way these funds will be spent.
Moreover, the recommendations could help refine regional and urban development policies at the EU
and at the national level, particularly with a view to the 2021-2027 Programming Period.

Given that urban dynamics are rarely limited to the administrative boundaries of a locality,
data was collected both for the county capitals themselves, and for their functional urban
zones. The functional urban zones have been defined using an EC-OECD methodology3. This is the same
methodology used by the Romanian Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration to
define the functional urban zones that are eligible for EU funding for the 2014-2020 Programming Period.

Romania’s economic performance
after 2000 has been Impressive
                          Between 2000 and 2013, Romania has been the fastest growing economy in the EU.
                          Benefiting from the EU accession, both before the actual accession in 2007, and after, Romania’s
                          economy has grown at a very fast rate. An influx of foreign direct investments, large remittances
                          sent from Romanians working abroad (Romania is one of the largest recipients of remittances in the
                          World), a strong export performance (going primarily to other EU countries), and growing internal
                          consumption have fueled the strong performance of the Romanian economy in the past years.

                          Between 1992 and 2015, Romania’s economy grew at a compound annual growth rate of
                          8.4%, and was one of the fastest growing economies in the World. Romania had a growth rate
                          in this time-period that was 1% higher than the average for Upper Middle-Income Countries and
                          more than three times the rate for the EU and High Income Countries. Most impressively, Romania
                          managed to catch up with the economies of Brazil and Mexico, which in 1992 had a GNI per Capita
                          that was 3 respectively 4 times as high as that of Romania.

                          The Romanian economy not only grew but also dramatically changed in the last 15 years, in
                          line with the single market integration process that took place in most CEE countries. This
                          involved the shift from subsidized low competitive sectors developed in the communist period such
                          as metallurgy, heavy machines building, or apparel production, to transportation, electronic and
                          electrical equipment. As Romania’s economy has become integrated into the EU trading block, it has
                          also started to morph and look more like the economy of the EU. Around 72% of the EU exports fall in
                          three large categories: transportation (e.g. cars, car parts, trucks, trains, airplanes); machines (TVs,
                          computers, mixers, microwaves, mobiles), and chemical products (soaps, shampoos, detergents,
                          fertilizers, medicaments). Romania’s export share in these three sectors went from 24% in 2000 to
                          46% in 2014. Moreover, in 2014, Romania was exporting 8 times more than it did in 1989, when the
                          Communist system fell apart.4

                          From a territorial perspective, all of Romania’s regions reported a significant GDP growth
                          between 2000 and 2014. However, as is indicated in the World Development Report 2009:
                          Reshaping Economic Geography (WDR’09), the development gap between the most dynamic
                          regions in Romania (the leading regions) and the less developed regions (the lagging regions) has
                          widened, despite the allocation of EU funding of around 7 bln. Euro for the regional cohesion only
                          in 2007-2013 programming period. The GDP/capita (PPS) for the Bucharest-Ilfov Region (the most
                          dynamic in the country) currently exceeds the EU-28 average by 29%, whereas the poorest region
                          in Romania (and the 4th poorest in the EU) – North East - reaches only 35% of the EU-28 average.

This growing gap between the leading and lagging regions in Romania is not a failure of the
EU Cohesion Policy, nor a failure of the territorial development policy in Romania, but simply
the way development takes place in growing economies. When looking at the data, one immediately
sees that regional growth rates have been relatively similar – between 2000 and 2014, all NUTS 2
regions in Romania have grown at compound annual growth rates of 7.6% to 8.8% (see figure below).
In fact, the lagging regions in Romania has been among the fastest growing regions in the EU. The
experience of most developed countries shows that unequal regional growth is a normal dynamic
in growing economies – it is in fact a sign that the economy is actually developing. Over time,
differences in living standards between regions disappear (i.e. people can have a similar quality of life
almost everywhere across the territory of the country), but the economy will continue to be driven
by a handful of leading regions – primarily the largest metropolitan area in the country.

Cities have driven economic growth
                         The 8 largest cities in Romania amass around 22% of the population and generate around
                         53% of the country’s GDP. When looking at the larger area of influence of the 8 Growth Poles (in
                         this case, the one-hour driving areas around the Growth Poles), the strength of these urban centers
                         becomes even more evident. Thus, the areas in the map below, amass around 50% of Romania’s
                         population and generate around 75% of firm revenues in Romania. These are some of Romania’s main
                         economic growth engines, and Romania is in this respect no different from all the other EU countries.

                         Within the EU, primate and secondary cities amass around 10%-30% of the country’s
                         population and generated around 50%-70% of the GDP (see figure below). These cities are the
                         economic growth engines of the EU. If they don’t function well, neither does the national economy
                         as a whole. It is therefore critical to have proper urban development policies at the national level,
                         and to intervene there where it is difficult or impossible for local authorities to intervene (e.g. the
                         development of metropolitan transport infrastructure).

                         Knowing that cities are a country’s growth engines is only half the story though. It is
                         important to also determine what exactly makes them successful. More specifically, it is important
                         to determine what exactly makes cities more attractive to investors, people, and tourists. Some
                         clues we already have. We know for example that primate cities (the New Yorks, Paris’, Londons,

8 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Tokyos, and Warsaws of this world) very rarely change their position in the national hierarchy.
New York was the largest city in the US in 1790, with a population of 33,000, and it remained the
largest city in 2010, with a population of around 8 million. Even when you bomb them out of oblivion,
partition them in 4, and then divide them in 2 for 40 years, the way Berlin was, they remain quite
resilient. Primate cities follow a dynamic of their own, and are the most attractive urban centers
for both investors and people. Usually, when primate cities do well, so does the economy as a whole.
When they do poorly, so does the economy.

While primate cities give the tone to the rest of the economy, it is often secondary cities
that are an economy’s source of dynamism. It is secondary cities where breakthrough innovations
are generated and where new economic sectors are born. The textile mill was invented in Lancashire
and Birmingham; the first steel mill was developed in Pittsburgh; the car was perfected for a mass
market in Detroit; movies made it to the big screen in Los Angeles; the computer and the internet
matured in Silicon Valley. These secondary cities have risen, and some have fallen, together with the
sectors they have given birth to. The most dynamic of them usually outpace the growth rate of the
primate cities. For example, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, Constanța, Brașov, or Craiova have grown
faster than Bucharest between 2011 and 20155.

                          In most larger EU countries (e.g. Germany, France, the UK), secondary cities have been the
                          main economic growth engines. In smaller EU countries, such as Ireland, Sweden, Denmark,
                          Belgium, or Austria, secondary cities have been less prominent – largely because they are fewer in
                          number, smaller in size, and because the primate cities are very strong. Still, even in these countries,
                          primate and secondary cities were responsible for over 50% of economic growth. Spain and Italy show
                          up as outliers. In essence, the poor performance of their primate and secondary cities, is reflected in
                          the overall poor performance of the economy. In Spain, Madrid has had an overall poor performance
                          between 2000 and 2013 (it underperformed the national economy), while the secondary cities have
                          witnessed economic regress, stagnation, or modest growth. In Italy, virtually every major city has
                          had a modest economic performance between 2000 and 2013, including Rome.

                          Interestingly, the performance of national economies in EU countries seems to closely
                          follow the performance of secondary cities in those respective countries. As the figure below
                          highlights, the performance of primate cities seems to be an outlier in almost every EU country –
                          only in Italy, Germany, and Ireland do primate cities have an economic performance similar to that
                          of the national economy and the secondary cities. On the other hand, national economies seem
                          to, almost uniformly, follow the performance of secondary cities. Thus, one could argue that the
                          strengthening secondary cities can ultimately help strengthen national economies.

Of course, Romania needs both Bucharest and its secondary cities to be dynamic and agile.
It is these cities and their functional urban zones that will push the development of the Romanian
economy in a new era. However, Romania still has a long way to go. Romania has the second lowest
GDP per capita in the EU after Bulgaria – with 15,200 Euro/inhabitant in 2014 representing only 55%
of the EU average (up from 41% in 2007). Currently, Romania has a 7-10 year development lag over
other Central and Eastern European countries like Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, or the Czech Republic
(i.e. it needs 7-10 years to reach their current development level) and a 35 year development lag over
OECD counties (i.e. it took OECD countries 35 years to develop from Romania’s current development
level to their current development level)6. Without strong and competitive cities, Romania will not be
able to bridge this development gap.

                        Of course, a city’s competitiveness is not something that can be engendered by fiat. We don’t
                        quite know why some cities perform better than others. We know there are a number of enabling
                        conditions that make a city’s economy take off (e.g. proximity to markets, a large human capital
                        pool, an existent large population and labor pool), but we are less astute at explaining differences
                        between cities with similar endowments.




Performance of Romanian cities
                        Before we discuss however why some Romanian cities have performed better than others,
                        it is important to first see their overall performance. Luckily, EuroStat collects data at the city
                        level, and it is easy to see how Romanian cities perform both internally and externally. A look at
                        their performance over the past years will then enable us to also posit what may have enabled such
                        a performance.

                        Bucharest is expectedly the top performing city in Romania, and its economy is larger than
                        that of 7 EU countries, including Croatia, Slovenia, and Luxembourg. When taken together
                        with countries and other cities in the EU, Bucharest is basically the 41st largest economy of the EU.
                        As such, a proper management of the economy of Bucharest is critical. When compared to other
                        capitals in the EU, Bucharest also does well, being among the more performant capitals (see figure
                        below). In essence, Romania’s primate city is now competing head to head, in terms of productivity,
                        with the other primate cities in the EU.

However, if the Romanian economy is to compete with Western economies, its secondary
cities have to become stronger. Currently, none of Romania’s secondary cities are among the
100 largest economies in the EU, and they significantly underperform secondary cities in Western
Europe. Bucharest may have a GDP per Capita (PPS) larger than that of Rome, Madrid, or Berlin,
but Germany and France, the two largest economies of the EU, each have ten cities among the top
100 largest economies of the EU. The UK, the third largest economy in the EU, has nine of its cities
among the top 100 largest EU economies. Paris and London have economies that are seven times
as large as that of Bucharest.

Strong and competitive secondary cities are also critical for a region’s performance, because
diffuse growth and development to surrounding localities. The maps below show that between
2002 and 2011, the regions that have developed the fastest are the dynamic cities and the areas
around them. This is in fact the essence of development – concentration in a few growth centers and
the diffusion of growth to surrounding areas, until every corner of the country is reached.

                           Development in Romania, following 1989, can be understood as the progressive filling of
                           a pyramid of glasses. The first step in the development process is the identification of a large
                           enough bottle (i.e. markets) to fill those glasses. For Romania, the EU common market represents a
                           very large bottle, which will pay dividends well into the future. The second step is the actual filling
                           of this pyramid of glasses. And, usually, the pyramid is filled from the top, on down. In Romania,
                           the primate city (i.e. Bucharest) was the first benefactor of EU integration, with many of the new
                           investments and jobs going there first. Secondary cities started on an accelerated growth path,
                           with a relative time lag. In essence, until Bucharest reached a certain level of economic maturity,
                           the other cities in Romania did not manage to growth as fast as Bucharest. Only in recent years did
                           secondary cities in Romania manage to reach higher levels of economic growth than Bucharest, and
                           are in the process of catching up with the capital.

                           However, while the flow of wealth and capital to the primate city is clear and direct, the flow
                           to secondary cities is less direct. It is not always immediately obvious which secondary city will
                           perform better. For example, between 2000 and 2013, Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Craiova, and Brașov,
                           outperformed (in terms of GDP per Capita (PPS) growth) their regions and the national economy. Iași
                           managed to outperform the North-East Region, but not the national economy. Constanța did not
                           outperform either the regional or the national growth rate. The performance of these cities is likely
                           both the result of a set of givens (e.g. size, proximity to the West, distance from Bucharest), but also
                           the result of conscious interventions (e.g. strong local leadership, the development of metropolitan
                           infrastructure, investments in business parks, or the increase in the quality of life).

                           While Bucharest outperformed secondary cities in the early transition years, most secondary
                           cities in Romania have had a stronger performance than Bucharest in recent years. This
                           dynamic can be further encouraged through targeted interventions and a clear urban development
                           policy. Between 2011 and 2015, most county capitals in Romania managed to outperform Bucharest
                           in terms of firm revenue growth. Bucharest has a disproportional share of firm revenues (largely
                           because most multi-nationals in the country register their headquarter there), but the output of
                           firms registered in Bucharest has grown slower than the output of firms registered in most of the
                           county capitals. This may suggest that Bucharest has reached a certain level of economic maturity,
                           and other cities are starting to come from behind.

Thus, the advice for policy makers is clear: a strong Romanian economy is impossible without
strong Romanian cities, and a focus on secondary cities is critical in the coming years! The
following analysis will shed more light on how secondary cities in Romania have performed in the
past years.


                                                                            KEY DEVELOPMENT DYNAMICS in ROMANIA I 15

                    The most dynamic and successful cities, are also the ones where people want to move. In what
                    follows, we will take a more in-depth look at the Romanian cities that have been most successful in
                    attracting people, and we will try to identify their recipe to success. Economic development inevitably
                    requires a concentration of people and resources in certain places, and it is this concentration that
                    makes both private companies and individuals more productive. Firms have a larger and more diverse
                    labor pool they can chose from in cities, while people have more opportunities they can pursue
                    and more people they can learn from. In what follows, we will look at commuting and migration in
                    Romania, to identify Romania’s magnet cities, and to try to determine their success recipe.

                    An analysis of commuter and migration patterns, should not be limited however to the
                    administrative boundaries of cities. Cities rarely exist in a vacuum – investors often move to peripheral
                    areas, and people often commute in from outside the center city. To determine the functional urban zones
                    of cities, an OECD-EC methodology was used. The methodology is simple and has universal application. To
                    determine the functional urban area of a city, once has to identify the localities where at least 15% of the
                    workforce commutes to that particular city. Once these localities are identified, the exclaves (i.e. localities
                    that are not part of a contiguous area around the center city) are eliminated, and the enclaves (i.e. the
                    localities that are part of a contiguous area around the center city, but don’t have 15% of their workforce
                    commuting to the city) are included. The proposed functional urban zones (FUAs) for the county
                    capitals in Romania, are included in the figure below.

                    It is important to note that even the smallest and least dynamic cities have a development
                    dynamic that goes well beyond their immediate administrative boundary. Moreover, at the
                    FUA level, hierarchies change a bit. For example, Cluj-Napoca is the second largest city in Romania,
                    but at the FUA level it is only fifth largest. The Ploiești FUA attracts the second largest number of
                    commuters after Bucharest, and over a third of those commute to the outer FUA areas (i.e. not the
                    core city). Similarly, the Timișoara FUA has attracted the second highest number of in-migrants
                    between 2001 and 2011, and over a third of those moved to the outter areas of the FUA. Timișoara
                    also has the second highest number of employed people at the FUA level, and 35% of those work in
                    the outter FUA areas.

18 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
The table below provides a number of key figures on commuting and migration to the county
capitals in Romania. This will provide a quick overview of what cities and FUAs have been most
successful at attracting migrants and commuters, and it will provide a backdrop for understanding
the key dynamics discussed further down. The FUAs of Bucharest, Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Iași, and
Constanța have been most adept at attracting people, while the FUAs of Bucharest, Ploiești, Pitești,
Constanța, and Timișoara attract the highest number of daily commuters. What makes these FUAs
particularly attractive will be the subject of the following sections.

Migration patterns in Romania

                          Who is migrating and when did they migrate?
                          The final results of the 2011 census indicate that 6.18 million Romanian citizens (30.7%
                          of the total stable population) changed their residence inside the country at least once
                          during their life time. The number is slightly smaller than the one reported at the 2002 census
                          (6.73 million, 31%). In addition, around 3 million Romanians migrated outside Romania after 1990.
                          In contrast with the commuting process, most migration flows in Romania are long-distance ones.
                          Almost 51% of the migrants moved to a different county than the one they were born or used to
                          live in and only 49% moved to a different settlement inside the same county. This indicates that
                          long-term migration is more intense where commuting is limited by distance, explaining also the
                          demographic collapse of many remote rural areas in Romania.

The urban-urban migration is in general a long-distance one, with 74.9% of the migrants
moving across the border of the county they used to live before, whereas the rural-rural one
involves shorter distances. In over 63% of the cases, rural-urban migration took place between
communities within the same county. Most of the migrants live in urban areas - 4.17 million,
representing 67.5% of the total number of citizens that changed their residence, respectively 38.4%
of the urban stable population, compared to only 2.01 million in rural areas. This is mostly the
effect of the planned or even forced industrialization and urbanization process that took place
in the communist period, especially in the 70s and 80s, but also to the shift to urban-urban
migration flows in the recent years.

Compared to the 2002 Census, the share of migrants living in urban areas dropped by
4% as a result of the strong suburbanization process that took place around the most
important cities. This resulted in a significant number of citizens that left the cities in order to
settle in the rural surrounding, where the living cost and conditions were generally more attractive.
The map below shows that the localities that have witnessed population growth between 2002
and 2011 are largely localities surrounding a larger urban area, or an urban agglomeration. This in
fact reflects a strong, and on-going suburbanization process, with the dynamic being particularly
obvious in the case of Bucharest, Constanța, Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Iași, Oradea, Sibiu, or Pitești.

Data Source: Romanian National Institute of Statistics

                          Between 2001 and 2011, the period of rapid economic growth in Romania, 65.5% of migrants
                          came from urban areas – primarily from smaller cities and towns to large cities, and from
                          large cities to suburbs. The FUAs of Cluj-Napoca, Brașov, Timișoara, and Iași, each received more
                          than 75% from urban areas. While there was significant migration within the FUA (e.g. people moving
                          from the center city to suburbs), the majority of migrants came from urban areas outside the FUA
                          – 73% in the case of Cluj-Napoca; 63% in Brașov; 71% in Timișoara; and 70% in Iași.

                          With the exception of Giurgiu, all the other 39 FUAs received more than 50% of migrants
                          from urban areas, and most received a majority of migrants from outside the FUA. Only Satu
                          Mare, Târgoviște, Pitești, Baia-Mare, and Miercurea Ciuc received more migrants from within the
                          FUA than from without. However, with the exception of a few FUAs (e.g. Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca,
                          Brașov, Iași, Sibiu), most of migrants to FUAs came from within the same county. This indicates that
                          most FUAs in Romania have territorially limited migration catchment areas. Annex 1 includes maps
                          with the migration catchment areas of all FUAs discussed here. It should also be noted here that
                          out-migration, particularly to EU countries (e.g. Italy, Spain, Germany, Hungary, France), has been
                          stronger than internal migration. Outmigration dynamics will be discussed in more detail later on.

Overall, in the migration processes taking place in Romania in the last 5-6 decades, urban
areas reported a positive balance of around 1.6 million people. This in-country migration is also
the main source of the modest increase in the urbanization rate, given that the natural growth has
been negative in the last 20 years, and out-migration has led to population decline in most localities
– urban and rural. While Romanian cities have become increasingly attractive to internal migrants,
rural-urban migration underwent a slight decline in the last two decades, with multiple explanations
and implications:
     -	     first of all, the mass of young, and highly mobile people residing in rural areas is much
            smaller than it was before 1990, as a result of pronounced demographic decline (the fertility
            rate in Romania has been hovering at around 1.3 for several years);
                                                                                                       ROMANIAN MAGNET CITIES I 23
                               -	    the decline of urban economies, particularly those that were developed during the Communist
                                     period but were unable to compete in a market economy, led to a surplus of labor force and
                                     unemployment in several urban areas. Thus, many small and medium-sized mono-industrial
                                     centers, and several big ones, became a prime source of out-migration – both outside and
                                     inside the country;
                               -	    the urban economies of the dynamic cities in Romania, based on high and medium-high
                                     services and industries, require labor force with a higher level of education and qualification,
                                     which is easier to find in urban areas. This explains why urban-urban flows are becoming
                                     more intense than rural-urban ones;
                               -	    an estimated 3 million Romanians have chosen to move to a different country and have
                                     thus limited the capture area of Romanian cities. As Romanian cities will become more
                                     competitive, it may be possible for them to gain back some of the people that have moved
                                     abroad.

                          Within Romania, cities and their FUAs have been the most attractive places for in-country
                          migration. More than 2/3 of the Romanian migrants moved to the functional urban areas of the
                          41 county capitals in Romania, out of which 36.2% moved to the FUAs of Bucharest and the seven
                          growth poles (which together have only 19% of the national population).

County capitals are the main destination for long-distance mobility, with 57% of the migrants
coming from outside the county. The cities attracting the largest share of long-distance migrants
were Bucharest, Brașov, Timișoara, Deva and Reșița (over 60%). Their capture area covers almost
the entire country, especially in the case of the capital city. All these cities developed significantly
in the last 50 years, in some cases by doubling or even tripling their stable population, and were
surrounded by areas with traditionally moderate natural growth (the western part of the country),
both factors contributing to a deficit of labor forced that had to be covered by internal migration.

On the other hand, cities such as Alexandria, Buzău, Târgu Mureș, Satu Mare and Oradea
gathered more than 70% of the total migrants from inside the county. In the cases of
Alexandria and Buzău, the large share of inner-county migrants can be explained by the limited
attractiveness of the two relatively small cities for people outside the county. On the other hand,
both of them are placed in the middle of extended, and relatively dense rural areas, which provide
plenty of demographic resources. In the cases of Târgu Mureș, Satu Mare and Oradea, cultural
factors may have played a role, given that all of these cities host important Hungarian communities
that generally preferred to stay close to a larger Hungarian community. Nonetheless, the fact they
had to territorially compete with bigger cities, such as Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Bucharest or Brașov,
in order to attract people from other areas of the country also explains why they did not perform
so well in the past years.

                          It is important to note here that rural-urban migration flows were generally short-distance
                          ones and primarily took place within the same county. This was especially the case in the
                          Communist period, when the need to quickly supply new state-owned industrial plants with labor
                          force required massive movements of people from rural to urban areas. Considering the poor
                          transport connections existing at the time, most of the migrants or commuters were brought from
                          the surrounding rural areas, generally less than 30-50 km. Moreover, some industrial plants were
                          built only to ensure the employment of the available labor force resources existing in a certain area,
                          regardless of costs, resources or expertise existing in the area.

                          The shift from state-planned to market-oriented economy also engendered a natural mobility
                          of the populations to opportunity centers, especially dynamic urban areas. Rural-urban
                          mobility was almost completely replaced by urban-urban flows, which are generally long-distance
                          ones. In 2011, 46.2% of the migrants that choose to move to the 40 county seats and Bucharest,
                          came from other urban settlements. The cities with the largest share of urban immigrants are
                          Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Baia Mare, Alba Iulia and Târgu Mureș, all from the intra-Carpathian region,
                          which has an urbanization rate above average. Timișoara and Cluj-Napoca, the most developed cities
                          in Romania after Bucharest, are attracting a lot of young people for studies and jobs, especially
                          from other cities in the northern, center and western part of the country. Baia Mare, Alba Iulia and
                          Târgu Mureș, beside the fact they are also university centers attract young people from different
                          towns around them. The cities that were less attractive to urban migrants in recent years include
                          Brăila, Giurgiu, Tulcea, Călărași and Drobeta Turnu Severin - all with less than 1/3 of the migrants
                          coming from urban areas. In these cities, the majority of migrants came from rural areas during the
                          Communist period.

The influence of the forced industrialization and urbanization implemented during the
Communist period is reflected also in the age structure of migrants. Almost 60% are over 45,
corresponding to the significant flows of people moving from rural areas between the 60s and the
80s. On the other hand, only 26% of the migrants are below 35, most of them being students that
move from small and medium cities to a limited number of university centers. When these cities
are also able to provide jobs for people with higher education, some of the university graduates
decide to stay. Strong universities are therefore critical for city development. Where universities
are already present, they should be strengthened; when they are absent or weak, local authorities
should consider strengthening other educational institutions present there (vocational schools, high-
schools, art schools, etc.). Not every city can become a hotbed for tertiary education, but all can
do something about strengthening and enlarging their human capital pool. Human capital is not
necessarily represented by people with tertiary education, but by people who have skills that few
other people have (e.g. craftsmen, artists, artisans).

Between 2001 and 2011, the period of rapid economic boom, an overwhelming share of
migrants (66.3%) were young people (less than 35 years of age). The most successful cities in
attracting young people were largely the important university centers in the country – Cluj-Napoca
(80.1%), Iași (74.4%); Timișoara (70.2%); Bucharest (69.5%); Sibiu (68.4%); Craiova (67.6%).

                          If rural-urban migration fueled the urbanization process in the Communist period, it is now
                          a burden for most cities, as migrants coming in from rural areas are to a large extent of
                          non-productive age. Bucharest is a case in point, as migrants represent almost 2/3 of the stable
                          population aged 65 plus, and less than 10% of those below the age of 25.

28 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
The cities with the largest share of young immigrants are Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara and
Iași, the top three university centers in Romania, each attracting a significant number of
students from an area of over 250 sq. km. Cities that developed a strong industrial footprint during
Communism, but failed to compete properly in a market economy, and on top of things also lost a
significant share of their human capital to Bucharest or to more developed countries, will likely face
significant demographic challenges in the coming years. Such cities include, among others, Brăila,
Ploiești, Galați or Deva. Brăila, for example, is the county capital with the highest mortality rate in
Romania – one the main reasons being the aged population.

Between 2001 and 2011, 56.6% of people migrated for personal reasons, 19.4% for studies,
and 11.1% for work. An overwhelming share of people who migrated for studies clustered in the
country’s large university centers. In Cluj-Napoca, 46.4% of migrants came for studies; in Iași, 43.7%;
in Timișoara, 34.5%; in Bucharest, 24.9%; in Craiova, 19.9%; in Sibiu, 18%; in Brașov, 17.7%.

Out of the total number of migrants, 42.9% are male and 57.1% female, females being not only
more mobile, but also more willing to undertake long-term migration. Men tend to be more stable
in terms of residence, but more inclined to commute for work. 58% of migrants move for personal
reasons (e.g. marriage); 21% move for work; 13% move for study; the rest have other reasons to move.
Studies were indicated as the main motivation for moving only for the migrants that choose Cluj-
Napoca and Iași, well known for attracting a significant number of students to their strong regional
universities, whereas personal reasons are generally indicated by those that moved to cities with a
poor job market, such as Buzău, Râmnicu Vâlcea or Alexandria.

Most migrants to the 40 county seats, namely 34%, have upper secondary studies, followed
by those with primary (25.9%), tertiary (23%) and lower secondary education (15.8). Migrants are
generally better educated than the average population of the country but slightly less educated than
the residents born in urban areas.

30 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
There is a strong link between educational attainment, age and previous residence. The young
migrants originating from urban areas usually hold at least a bachelor degree, whereas those aged
over 65 with the previous residence in rural areas generally have only primary or lower secondary
studies. These are generally the migrants that moved to urban areas in the Communist period and
were employed in the industrial sector.

The cities with the largest share of immigrants with tertiary education are those that
managed to attract young people in the recent years, especially university centers such as
Cluj-Napoca, Bucharest, Iași or Timișoara. On the other hand, the cities that faced a decline in the
last two decades (e.g. Giurgiu, Călărași, Brăila, Galați, Tulcea etc.), after attracting numerous rural
workers with basic competences in the Communist period, are those hosting most migrants with
primary and secondary education. Between 2001 and 2011, 31% of migrants had tertiary education,
suggesting a much higher mobility of people with higher education in times of economic boom. The
most attractive places for people with higher education were Bucharest (41% of all migrants), Cluj-
Napoca (37% of all migrants), Timișoara (29%), Iași (30%), and Brașov (31%).

With respect to the field of activity, 58.4% of the immigrants work in the service sector,
22.5% in industry, 11.5% in agriculture, forestry and fishing and 7.7% in construction. This dynamic is
in line with national averages. Nonetheless, there was a significant shift from industry, which used
to employ over half of the urban labor force before 1990

In major cities, such as Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța or Iași, the service sector
employs most of the migrants (60-70%), with industry being less well represented. These cities
also gather most of the highly qualified people, with higher income expectations, which in turn
make industrial activities less competitive and attractive. Medium-sized cities, with a well-developed
industrial sector (especially automotive), such as Arad, Pitești, or Bistrița, attract the largest share
of migrants working in manufacturing.

However, most of the migrants activating in the service sector are actually working in low added-
value sub-sectors, such as trade or transport. From this perspective, it is more relevant to look at the
share of migrants working in the so-called KIS (Knowledge Intensive Services) activities. Bucharest, Cluj-
Napoca and Iași are the cities with the largest share of people working in these sectors (IT&C, financial
services, education, health, public administration), that generally provide also the best paid jobs.

private activities, namely IT&C and financial services, the city ranking remains almost de same. The

Commuter patterns in Romania

                          Who is commuting?
                          In 2011, when the last Census was completed, 21.2% of the employed people in Romania
                          (1.81 million people) were working in another settlement than the one they resided in, out
                          of which around 247,000 in another country. The number of commuters has increased significantly
                          over the previous census (2002), when only 1.31 million Romanians (16.8% of the total number of
                          employed people) were working in another settlement. Romanian workers became more mobile in the
                          last 10 years in all counties, excepting Prahova and Gorj. The share of commuters to another county
                          than the one they live in increased from 23.7% to 39.8% since the previous census, whereas the share
                          of commuters within the same county decreased over the same time period.

                          The labor force in the less developed southern and eastern part of the country became more
                          mobile, as these regions have grown over the past years, while the labor force in the northern
                          and western areas remained more or less equally mobile. Thus, the counties around Bucharest,
                          most of them predominantly rural and confronted with significant socio-economic disparities, are
                          becoming more and more dependent on the job opportunities provided by the capital city. In this

36 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
context, the number of commuters from the counties of Teleorman, Ialomița, Giurgiu or Călărași
towards Bucharest almost tripled in the last 10 years.

Most commuters are males (61.1%), while female workers seem to be less mobile both in
terms of number and commuting distance. The gender disparity increased over 2002, when only
55.7% of the total commuters where men. This gender difference can be explained by the fact that
over 55% of the overall employees in Romania are males, but also by some cultural patterns. The
development of light industries and services in many urban and even rural settlements, providing
jobs mostly for female workers, together with the decline of heavy industries, generally targeting
the male employees, obliged the second group to be more mobile. The limited accessibility of some
remote areas and the challenging commuting conditions also prevent more female workers from
pursuing job opportunities in other areas.

The functional urban areas with the largest share of male commuters are Galați, Tulcea,
Drobeta Turnu Severin, Giurgiu and Slobozia (over 70%), cities with an underdeveloped service
sector and largely depending on heavy industries (ship building, metallurgy, machinery etc.) and
agriculture. A more balanced structure of commuters by gender is specific for the cities in central
and western part of the country (Bistrița, Sfântu Gheorghe, Alba Iulia, Cluj-Napoca, Sibiu, Miercurea
Ciuc, Vaslui, Focșani), where more service and light industry jobs (e.g. textiles, footwear, food
production) are available.

Young workers are also more mobile than the older ones. Over 30% of the workers aged 20-
29 are commuting, whereas 87% of the ones over 60 are working in the same settlement they live
in. Compared to 2002, labor mobility has significantly grown for all age groups. The number of
commuters aged over 50 increased from 106,000 to 228,000 during this interval, also influenced
by the aging demographic trend.

Young workers are also more mobile in terms of distance, the ones aged 25-29 being more involved
in long-distance commuting (outside the county they live or abroad). Youngsters aged below 25 tend to
be less involved in long-term commuting than in 2002, also because more of them are enrolled in the
tertiary education and often pursue part-time jobs in the university centers where they live.

                          Competitive cities, with a dynamic economy and significant inflows of foreign direct
                          investments seem to attract more young commuters. Over 50% of the workers commuting
                          to Cluj-Napoca, Bucharest, Sibiu and Oradea are aged below 35. High shares of young commuters
                          are also recorded in Timișoara, Iași, Arad, Baia Mare, Bistrița, or Satu Mare. To some extent, cities
                          with a high concentration of university students (Cluj-Napoca, Bucharest, Iași, Timișoara, Sibiu,
                          Oradea) also have a high share of young commuters, reflecting both commuting done for educational
                          purposes, and commuting done by young graduates that have found work in the university center
                          post-graduation. As it will be discussed later, universities are a critical people magnet, and given
                          that they attract a lot of young and well qualified people, they are also critical for city’s economy –
                          they make the cities more attractive to high value-added investors.

                          Cities that do not attract a lot of commuters, also seem to be less attractive for young
                          commuters. Cities like Alexandria, Giurgiu, Slobozia, Galați or Drobeta Turnu Severin, have struggling
                          economies and an aging population. As such, they attract both fewer commuters and fewer young
                          commuters. Cities with a struggling economy basically lose on two fronts. For one, they lose a lot of
                          their young population, as young people leave for opportunities elsewhere. And, by losing their young
                          population they become less attractive to young commuters and migrants, which are essential for
                          the revigoration of the city economy. This vicious cycle makes it difficult for these cities to enter a
                          new development phase, based on higher value-added activities, given that investors face difficulties
                          in recruiting qualified employees

Over 62% of the commuters reside in rural areas, although 54% of the country’s total
population lives in urban areas. 29.2% of the rural workforce is commuting compared with only
14.6% of the urban workforce, since most job opportunities are concentrated in cities. The large
share of urban-urban commuting flows, almost double against 2002, also indicates that small
towns with a declining economy are depending more and more on the jobs provided by big and
medium-size cities.

                Commuter flows are higher in and around dynamic cities, but overall commuter flows seem
                to be less intensive than in the Communist times. The census in 2002 was the first one to
                gather exhaustive data on the commuting flows in Romania. Nonetheless, a team coordinated by
                Prof. Dumitru Sandu from the University of Bucharest estimated, based on a ”migration community
                census” the number of commuters from each rural settlement in 1992. The results indicate that
                1.25 million Romanians living in rural areas commuted to urban centers at the beginning of the 90s,
                compared with 825,000 in 2002 and 961,000 in 2011. The decreasing number of rural commuters
                in the 90s can be explained by the decline of small industrial urban centers that are currently sources
                of labor force for big urban centers, but also for external migration. For example, in Cluj county, the
                number of workers commuting from rural areas to the secondary cities of Turda (including Câmpia
                Turzii) and Dej (including Gherla) dropped by more than 40% against 1992 and these four cities are
                currently providing 12.3% of the total commuters to Cluj-Napoca.

                The more intensive commuter flows in Communist times also reflect barriers to migration at
                the time. During Communism, migration of people from place to place was strictly regulated by the
                Central Government, and people had difficulties moving where they wanted to move. Rather, people were
                “allocated” to different localities, based on estimated needs by the central authorities. As such, people
                commuted to work, but had a harder time to move for work. Also, commuter patterns were more evenly
                distributed across the territory of the country, reflecting the policy of the Communist Government to
                spread economic activity evenly – i.e. in an attempt to have balanced regional growth by fiat.

                Currently, the largest cities in Romania attract most of the commuting workforce from
                rural areas. Nevertheless, some of those that are at the heart of a larger urban system, such as
                Bucharest, Ploiești, Pitești, Brașov, Constanța, Baia Mare, Deva, Alba Iulia, Râmnicu Vâlcea, attract
                a significant number of commuters from their satellite urban settlements.

                When analyzing the rural-urban commuting flows in Romania, one must also consider the
                existing settlement ranking in Romania. The suburbanization process that took place around
                the most important cities in the last two decades resulted in so-called ”dorm neighborhoods” with a
                rural status, with a fast growing number of inhabitants. For example, 20% of the employees that are
                commuting to Cluj-Napoca are living in Florești, a suburban commune with over 30,000 inhabitants,
                more than most small cities in Romania. Thus, the share of rural-urban commuting is actually
                smaller than it may appear.

                26.2% of the employees commuting to the 40 county seats in Romania have tertiary education,
                more than average percentage for the whole labor force in Romania (22.8%). 58% of commuters
                to the 40 county capitals had completed a form of secondary education (e.g. high school, vocational
                education), while 16% only had a primary degree. Overall, commuters are more educated than residents.
                One of the explanations for this occurrence is that most of the workers with tertiary and secondary
                education cannot find suitable jobs in their place of residence, especially in rural areas.

                Most high-skilled commuters work in big cities (62.5% of them only in the eight growth poles),
                the ones concentrating the job offer for their level of education, especially in the service sector, and
                the ones with the highest average wage. Thus, the cities with the largest share of commuters holding
                at least a bachelor degree are Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest, the ones that managed to attract most
                investors and entrepreneurs in high added value sectors in the last decade.

                The cities with a dominant industrial sector, such as Galați, Bistrița, Tulcea, Buzău or
                Călărași, generally attract less educated commuters, since they do not provide attractive jobs
                for workers with superior education. There is also a strong correlation between age and education.
                The cities that are less attractive to young people, generally report a small share of well-educated
                commuters.

From the ISCO-08 (International Standard Classification of Occupations) occupational structure
perspective, most commuters are craft and related trade workers and professionals. Overall,
only 18% of the jobs occupied by commuters require university studies (although 26% hold at least
a bachelor degree, indicating that at least 8% of them are overqualified for the position they are
currently occupying), 67% required a secondary degree, and 15% required just basic alphabetization.
The highly-skilled commuters tend to be more mobile than the ones with basic studies. Over 47% of
the commuting managers are working outside the county they live in (hinting to possible masked
migration), whereas only 22% of workers engaged in elementary occupations do the same. Most
professionals, clerical support, service and sale commuters are female workers, whereas the male
one are mostly industrial and construction operators.

                          The comparison with the results of the 2002 census, indicate a tendency towards a
                          higher specialization of commuters as well as a reorientation from the industry-related
                          occupations to the service ones, in line with the nationwide job market tends. Thus, the share
                          of blue-collar workers decreased from 43% to 15%, whereas the share of professionals commuting
                          almost doubled. A significant share (25%) of commuters are craft and related trade workers, most
                          of them working in retail.

                          Occupational and educational commuter dynamics are strongly interlinked, in the sense that
                          top jobs are generally occupied by the employees with the highest level of education. Thus, the cities
                          with the largest share of managers and professionals commuting are the most dynamic ones, such
                          as Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest. This is also the case of some small county seats (Vaslui, Reșița etc.)
                          with a very small number of overall commuters, most of them being professionals in the public
                          sector (education, public administration etc.). On the other hand, mostly industrial cities, such as
                          Arad, Buzău, Bistrița, Călărași or Tulcea attract the largest share of qualified commuters with
                          secondary and lower secondary education (craftsmen, operators, assemblers etc.).

                          56% of the total number of commuters to the county seats in Romania are working in the
                          service sector. Services sectors have offered the largest average monthly wage and have created
                          most new jobs in the past years, especially in big cities. Industry employs 29.2% of commuters,
                          while the construction sector employs 12.4%, thus being the sector with the most mobile workers.
                          Agriculture, forestry and fishing only employ 2.5% of commuters.

                          Compared to the 2002 Census, the share of commuters working in the service sector has
                          grown by almost 17%, reflecting the overall structural change of the national economy, especially
                          the decline of some low added-value industrial activities, such as mining, clothing or heavy machinery,
                          that used to attract many commuters in the Communist period.

                          The primary sector (agriculture, forestry, fishing) is the least appealing for commuters,
                          largely because it already informally employs most of the labor force in rural areas (over 50%) and
                          because of the low level of remuneration in the formal sector. Even in the agricultural poles of the
                          country, such as Călărași, Brăila, Slobozia, Focșani (vineyards), Vaslui, Alexandria, Tulcea, Giurgiu,
                          less than 5-10% of registered commuters work in this sector.

                           The secondary sector (industry, including energy, extraction, processing, water and waste
                           management) is, on the other hand, the main employer for commuters in a few industrial
                           poles, such as Pitești, Arad, Satu Mare, Bistrița (over 45% of total commuters) – cities that were very
                           successful in attracting foreign investors, especially active in the automotive sector. Nonetheless,
                           most commuters work in low and medium-low technology industries, such as food processing,
                           textiles and wearing apparel, footwear, wood processing etc. – requiring less skilled personnel, with
                           below-average wages. This is the case for some small and medium-sized county seats, such as Vaslui,
                           Focșani, Botoșani, Brăila, Sfântu Gheorghe, Bistrița, Baia Mare, or Satu Mare.

                           The share of commuters working in high technology sectors (pharmaceuticals, computers, and
                           electronics) and medium high technology industries (chemistry, electrical equipment, machinery,
                           automotive, aeronautics, railway, and shipping transport equipment), based on the classification of
                           EUROSTAT and EC, is below 50% in most Romanian cities, with the notable exception of Pitești,
                           where an important car plant operates.

                           Galați, Suceava, Iași, Tulcea, Vaslui, Drobeta Turnu Severin – 15-20% of the total commuters).

                           The main employer in Romania, the service sector, employs more than 40% of the total
                           number of commuters in almost all county capitals, with a maximum in the big cities, such
                           as Bucharest, Constanța, or Cluj-Napoca (over 61%). Nonetheless, most of the commuters working
                           in this sector are actually employed in low value-added service activities, such as retail or road
                           transport. The share of commuters working in knowledge intensive high tech services (KIS), according
                           to the EUROSTAT classification, is much smaller.

Nonetheless, one should also consider that the KIS definition has its limitations, at least
in the case of Romania, in the sense that it includes also service activities with low added value,
such as security, but also the public ones, such as central and local administration, in the broad
sense. If only IT&C and financial services are considered, the activities with the biggest average
monthly wage in Romania, the city ranking is quite different. Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca are the
most attractive destinations for commuters active in these two top sectors.

The automotive industry is the most dependent on commuters (46% of the total labor force in
2011, against 31% in 2002), followed by the petrochemical sector, mineral extraction, constructions,
HR services, air transportation and forestry. On the other hand, only 3% of the labor force in
agriculture is commuting because of the existing large share of informal employment in this sector,
                                                                                                                       ROMANIAN MAGNET CITIES I 45
                           especially in remote rural areas. Nonetheless, the sectors that still gather the highest absolute
                           number of commuters are the ones that employ most staff nationwide – construction, trade/retail,
                           transport, public administration or agriculture.

                           Compared to 2002, the number of commuters increased in most sectors, with the exception
                           of a number of declining industries, such as mineral extraction, clothing, machinery, chemistry and
                           petro-chemistry, conventional energy, wood processing and furniture.

                           The data indicates that entrepreneurs are less mobile than employees, since only 12% of the
                           employers and 6% of the freelancers are commuting compared with 28% of employed staff (up to
                           64% in rural areas). Employers and freelancers generally prefer to stay close to their businesses
                           explaining why they tend to be highly concentrated in big cities.

                           The counties with the most mobile labor force are the ones that have strong centers of
                           opportunities or are close to strong centers of opportunity (i.e. areas with a high concentration
                           of firms and jobs), such as Ilfov (the informal metropolitan area of Bucharest), Prahova (with
                           Ploiești being one of the most dynamic industrial and logistic hubs in Romania), Argeș (around
                           the Pitești-Mioveni area, the core of the Romanian automotive industry), Dâmbovița (part of the
                           triangle of economic and demographic concentration formed by Bucharest, Ploiești and Pitești),
                           Satu Mare and Arad (at the western border, with important industrial hubs) – all with over 25% of
                           the labor force commuting. Counties with less mobile workers include Brăila, Vaslui, Galați, Botoșani,
                           Dolj, Mehedinți, Olt, Tulcea, Bistrița-Năsăud (less than 20% of the total labor force). The common
                           characteristic of these counties is the lack of dynamic and competitive cities able to attract labor
                           force from a significant distance.

The strong links between local development and commuter numbers were already pointed
out by Professor Dumitru Sandu from the Faculty of Sociology in Bucharest. He tested
the correlation between the value of the Local Human Development Index (LHDI) at territorial
administrative unit (TAU) and the share of commuters for the Ploiești Growth Pole Metropolitan
Area, the one with the highest intensity of labor force mobility in Romania. The results indicated that
the settlements with the highest rate of commuting to the core city were also the most developed
ones in terms of social-economic development, since they benefit from significant bigger financial
inflows. This comes to strengthen the theory that dynamic cities diffuse development to the areas
around them, but require good accessibility to do this job.

                         In terms of commuting distance, the only counties with over 10% of the labor force working
                         outside the county are the ones around Bucharest (Ilfov, Giurgiu, Călărași, Ialomița, Dâmbovița
                         and Teleorman), indicating that the capital city is the only one capable of attracting a significant
                         number of workers from more than 50 km. Nonetheless, despite attracting the biggest number of
                         commuters, Bucharest is the only growth pole in Romania that has no official metropolitan area,
                         indicating the need for a coherent and clear definition of functional urban zones.



                         Where are people commuting?
                         Out of the 1.8 million commuters in Romania, more than 51% are working in the 40 county
                         capitals and Bucharest – 67% if their metropolitan/functional urban areas are considered.
                         This percentage has increased in the last two decades because most of the small cities that resulted
                         from the forced industrialization and urbanization strategy of the Communist government did not
                         adjust well to the requirements of a market-driven economy.

                         In 2011, when the last Census was completed, these 41 metropolitan/functional urban areas
                         provided 61% of the total jobs existing in Romania and over 70% of the non-agricultural ones.
                         They also generate 90% of the national corporate income, out of which 75% is generated by the one-
                         hour driving areas around Romania’s 8 growth poles.

48 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Economic performance and commuting are strongly connected. The top cities in Romania,
from the perspective of corporate income and total number of jobs, are, in general, also the ones
attracting most commuters (see figure below). Bucharest and the seven regional growth poles
themselves pool 36% of the total number of commuters in Romania.

However, not only economic density and performance matters when it comes to commuting.
Distance is vital and demographic density is also important. The share of commuters that pass the
county border for work does not exceed 10%, excepting a few counties around Bucharest although
the income disparities between different regions in Romania are quite significant. On the other hand,
cities with rather poor economic performance, such as Târgoviște, had intensive commuting flows
because they are surrounded by dense rural areas.

The city that attracts the highest number of commuters is Bucharest (over 252,000 workers
only to the city and 331,000 if its functional urban area is also considered). Beside the fact the city
itself generates approximately 25% of the national GDP and over 1.1 million jobs, it is the core of
the area with the highest density of population and companies. The capture area of the capital city
extends up to 100 km (e.g. the northern part of Teleorman county), especially in easy accessible
areas with poor economic development. The average monthly net wage in Bucharest is at least
double than in most of the surrounding counties (Ialomița, Călărași, Giurgiu, Teleorman), making it
attractive also for long-distance commuting.

Other cities that are very attractive for non-resident workers are larger urban agglomerations
such as Ploiești, Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Brașov Pitești and Iași. However, from a
relative perspective, the cities of Pitești, Ploiești, Târgoviște, Deva, Târgu Mureș, Alba Iulia, Miercurea
Ciuc and Brașov report the largest share of jobs occupied by commuters (over 25%). Despite the
fact some of them are medium-size county seats, these cities are at the center of more extended
urban system (Brașov, Pitești, Deva, Alba Iulia) or are surrounded by densely populated rural areas
(Târgoviște, Miercurea Ciuc). Cities such as Reșița, Tulcea, Botoșani, Vaslui, Giurgiu or even Craiova
have the lowest commuting rate not only because their economies have shrunk in the last two
decades, but also because their surroundings are scarcely populated (the counties of Caraș-Severin
and Tulcea have the lowest population density per sq. km. in Romania – one is a mountainous
area, the other houses much of the Danube Delta). In sum, density and concentration seem to be
important triggers for commuters.
                                                                                             ROMANIAN MAGNET CITIES I 49

                Commuting is also strongly linked with suburbanization, with people moving to live outside
                core cities and subsequently commuting for work/study in the core cities. Cities such as
                Ploiești, Pitești, Brașov and Constanța are attracting a significant number of commuters in their
                metropolitan/functional urban areas either because more and more companies migrated from
                the city center to the outskirts under cost, environmental or infrastructure-related (e.g. industrial
                parks) pressures, or because they inherited a more balanced distribution of economic platforms
                inside the metropolitan area. This was especially the case of cost-sensitive and medium-low added
                value activities such as industry, trade or logistics. Other cities, such as Cluj-Napoca, although
                performing above average, are largely depending on high and medium-high added value services
                (IT&C, financing, higher education, health, public administration etc.) that are more geographically
                concentrated in the core city. The employees in these sectors are in fact less mobile than the ones
                in industry, constructions and even trade. Other medium-size county seats with a less developed
                economy (e.g. Reșița, Giurgiu, Vaslui, Botoșani, Alexandria, Călărași, Slobozia, Slatina etc.) simply did
                not manage to diffuse growth and development to surrounding areas, resulting in poor demographic
                and economic suburbanization. Thus, almost all the commuters they attract work in the core city.




50 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
WHAT MAKES CITIES
  ATTRACTIVE




                    51
Which cities are most attractive to
migrants?

                          As indicated in the previous subchapter, inner migration, primarily from rural to urban areas,
                          was the main source of urbanization growth in the communist period. The table below shows
                          that at the end of the Second World War there were significant differences in the population of
                          the top 10 cities in Romania, in 1992, just two years after the collapse of the Communist regime,
                          Romania had seven secondary cities with almost the same population (over 300,000 inhabitants
                          each). This was the result of the centralized urbanization and industrialization plan implemented
                          by the communists. In order the balance the migration flows, that were naturally oriented towards
                          these growth poles, the authorities even decided to ban migration to the big cities and to force
                          people to move to medium-size cities. As a result, cities such as Zalău and Vaslui artificially doubled
                          their population in less than 15 years.

                         The last decades, and especially the recent years after the EU accession, rebalanced these
                         state-planned migration flows, based on market-driven forces. The natural growth poles, such
                         as Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca or Timișoara continue to attract young people, whereas some cities which
                         have grown “artificially” in the communist period are shrinking and losing population. For example,
                         the city of Vaslui gained almost 40,000 inhabitants in the 1980s and lost 25,000 people after 1990,
                         most of them moving to Iași, to Bucharest, to out-migration, or even to the rural areas they came
                         from 20-30 years back.

In this context, it is relevant and useful to analyze the migration flows to the county seats
and their functional urban area in different time intervals:

     -	     the period before 1970: involves migration flows that took place before the peak of the
            industrialization and urbanization process conducted during Communism. It is characterized
            by more urban-urban movements, especially in the 50s;

     -	     the 1970s: this interval overlaps with the industrialization and urbanization process, but
            with no limitations with respect to inner migration. Most flows are rural-urban ones and
            targeting both big and medium-sized cities;

     -	     the 1980s: this interval also corresponds to the Communist industrialization and urbanization
            process, but also brings legal barriers in moving to big cities and an important economic
            decline, especially in the second half. Flows are again mostly rural-urban ones, but targeting
            especially medium-sized cities;

     -	     the 1990s: the first ten years after the collapse of the communist regime led to a severe
            decline of urban economies. After 1997, a certain increase in the urban-rural migration can
            be observed, corresponding to a reverse-migration process. People that moved from rural
            areas to cities in the 70s and 80s decided to move back to their previous residences once
            they lost their jobs or could not afford the cost of urban living;

     -	     the last decade (after 2000): corresponds to a period of economic growth that was not
            equally distributed at national level, leading to an increase in the territorial mobility of
            the labor force. For the first time, urban-urban flows became quite important, because
            of the surplus of labor and young people living in medium and small-sized cities with a
            weak economic base. Some competitive poles, especially Bucharest and the cities that were
            close to the western border entered a period of intensive growth, that also resulted in a
            suburbanization process – an issue that is discussed at length in this report.

Bucharest and the seven regional growth poles attracted most migrants in the last 50
years, except in the 80s, when migration to big cities was banned by the Communist authorities in
order to balance the territorial development of the country. The last decade shows that these large
agglomerations are becoming more and more attractive, especially for young people from small and
medium-sized cities.

Bucharest is the city that attracts most migrants every year, also because it is at least
six time bigger than any other city in Romania. Brașov was the second most attractive city
in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was a symbol of the industrialization policy implemented by
the Communist Party. Timișoara occupied the second position in the 1980s and 1990s, being an
important industrial center that managed to maintain its competitiveness during the shift to the
market economy, owing to its good location on the Western border of Romania. Timișoara is closely
followed by Cluj-Napoca, especially in recent years, a city that is becoming the most attractive
educational center after Bucharest and developing a very competitive service sector, with a strong
IT&C industry (software development already provides approximately 10% of the total number of
jobs). Between 2001 and 2011, 63% of migrants that came to the Timișoara FUA came from outside
Timiș County (the county of Timișoara); in the case of the Cluj-Napoca FUA, 61.3% of migrants came
from outside Cluj County in the same time period.
	                                                                                WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE            I 55
                          Other cities, such as Constanța, Craiova and Galați, were very competitive in the Communist
                          period, but did not managed to maintain their attractiveness in recent years, one of the
                          reasons being that they have to territorially compete with Bucharest. The migrants these FUAs have
                          attracted were primarily from their respective counties (i.e. they had smaller attraction areas) – 58%
                          for Constanța, 57% for Craiova, or 57.3% for Galați. This unequal competition affects also cities such
                          as Brașov and Ploiești, surrounded by areas with strong migration flows to Bucharest. From this
                          perspective, Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara, both situated at around 500 km away from Bucharest and
                          close to the western border, have the best premises to continue to attract people from their capture
                          area without competing with a bigger FUA.

Bucharest and the seven growth poles have large migration catchment areas. The migration
flows to Bucharest are dominant in 18 counties from the southern and eastern part of the country,
those to Cluj-Napoca in 10 counties, covering the entire historical region of Transylvania (excepting
Brașov and Hunedoara), to Timișoara in 6 counties (all the western and south-western part of the
country), to Iași in 5 counties (the north-eastern part of the country), to Constanța in two counties
(Constanța and Tulcea), one to Brașov (Covasna County), and one to Craiova (Dolj).

Compared to the previous census, the migration capture area of Cluj-Napoca and Iași
extended with 5, respectively 4 counties. The one of Timișoara remained the same. The other
growth poles, including Bucharest, have had a shrinking capture area, especially by becoming less
attractive to (a shrinking base of) university students.

All university centers lost students in the last decade, as a direct effect of the severe
decline of birth rate after 1990, but some universities managed to remain more competitive
than others. While the student population in Cluj-Napoca dropped by less than 8% in 2015 over
2002, Timișoara, Iași and Bucharest lost 28% of their student base; in Brașov the decrease was 27%;
in Constanța 22%; in Craiova 40%; in Ploiești 23%. As a result, Cluj-Napoca currently hosts 12.2% of
the entire student population in Romania, compared to a share of 9.1% in 2002.

The maps above indicate that only Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca are attracting students from
several regions of Romania, some from a long-distance, while the other large university centers
have a limited regional capture area. This influences the overall competiveness of the cities, given
that the availability of skilled labor force became the main driver for business development, especially
in high added-value sectors, such as IT&C or BPO.




The Zipf Law – Destiny or Policy Tool?

Geographers and urban development specialists know the Zipf Law well, and it does seem to
predict quite well how the system of cities will develop in a country that grows organically.
The Zips Law states that in a country that grows organically, there will usually be a primate city,
which rarely loses its position in the country’s hierarchy. The primate city is usually followed by
1-2 cities with a population around half that of the primate city; then 2-3 cities with a population
around 1/3 that of the primate city; and so on. Thus, when you plot on a graph the log of the city’s
population and the log of its rank in the national hierarchy, you get almost a perfect distribution. The
graphs below show how this distribution looks like in six countries that have developed organically.

Of course, Romania did not develop organically before 1989. When the centrally planned system
was removed, Romania had a system of cities that was more or less skewed – in essence, it had
no real secondary cities. There was Bucharest, the unquestionable primate city, with a population
of around 2 million, and 6 cities with a population of around 300,000. There was no city with a
population of around 800,000 – 1,000,000, and no city with a population of around 500,000-
600,000. Things did not change substantially by 2002, given that the Romanian economy did not
make any substantial progress in this timeframe.

However, things took a turn for the “normal” in                                       6.5
2011. As the economy of Romania embarked on an
aggressive growth path, the system of cities seems to
have also followed suit. For one, Bucharest lost some of                               6

its population – both due to demographic decline, but also
due a suburbanization process, with a lot of people moving
                                                                   Log (Population)

to the neighboring Ilfov county, or even further. In fact, all
major cities have lost population between 2002 and 2011,
with the exception of Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara. It is                                 5
these two cities that seem to distance themselves from
the pack, and play the role of main secondary cities. It

is also these cities, and their FUAs, that have attracted
the largest number of migrants between 2002 and 2011.
This is a particular important dynamic, given that it is in                            4
this decade that cities in Romania managed to attract the                                   0   0.5    1        1.5   2      2.5

This points deserves repeating: at no point during the history of Romania, did the FUAs of
the 41 capitals in Romania manage to attract as many migrants as they did between 2001
and 2011. Before, migration was tightly controlled by the central government, or people were simply
not on the move because of the lack of economic opportunities. The 1980s and the 1990s, two
decades of economic decline, were also the two time periods with the lowest migration levels.

                                                                                                WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 61
                              Obviously, the more dynamic an economy is, the more people are on the move. Conversely,
                              the more people are on the move, the better off the economy is. A mobile population is a sign
                              that resources in the economy are adequately allocated. Basically, people move to the places where
                              they can be most productive, and the most productive firms usually move to the places with the
                              most productive people.

                              And sure enough, the moment the Romanian economy took off, so did people. However, unlike
                              the Communist times, people did not move where the Government told them to, but rather where
                              they wanted to. The most attractive cities in this time of economic expansion seem to be Bucharest,
                              Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Iași – together, these four FUAs have attracted 46% of the migrants
                              moving to the 41 county capitals. Bucharest and the seven regional growth poles, taken together,
                              received 59% of all migrants going to the 41 county capitals. There is also another interesting dynamic.

                              Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Iași, received proportionally more migrants than Bucharest did.
                              More specifically, while Bucharest has a population that is around 6 times as large as the population
                              of these three cities, the number of migrants it received between 2001 and 2011 is only three times
                              at large. Thus, if we do the Zipf distribution for the number of migrants, we see a pattern that more
                              closely resembles what we would expect to see in a country that grows organically (see figures below).

                              If these trends will continue, moreover, if the trends will be augmented by strong economic
                              growth, it is possible that the secondary city gap will be filled in the future. 40% of all
                              migrants that moved to Cluj-Napoca after 1970, have done so after 2011; the share was 36% in the
                              case of Iași, and 35% in the case of Timișoara. By comparison, this share was only 27% in Bucharest
                              (which was also the average for the other 40 FUAs), indicating a more reduced migration dynamic
                              in this time-period.

                              Now, another thing the Zipf Rule tells us, is that secondary cities rarely grow beyond half
                              the population of primate cities.There seems to be a clear limit to how big secondary cities can
                              grow, although it is often secondary cities that are the most dynamic places in a country. Given the
                              population size of the City of Bucharest, Romania should normally have 1-2 cities with a population
                              of around 800,000 – 1,000,000.

                              Another thing we learn from the Zipf Rule is that the distribution in the system of cities
                              holds over time, although the rank of individual cities may change. In the most dynamic
                              economies, such as that of the US, secondary cities change rank quite frequently. The industrial
62 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
hubs of the Rust Belt have in the past decades been replaced with the high-tech hubs of the Sun
Belt. In Europe, cities change rank less frequently, but it still happens. Cluj-Napoca was the fifth
largest city in Romania in 1992, at the beginning of the transition, but it is second now. In Poland,
Katowice is the second largest urban agglomeration, but it is smaller cities like Poznan and Wroclaw
that are the dynamic urban hubs in the country.




The Primacy Effect and the
Secondary City Gap
All things being equal, it is likely the Bucharest will remain the most attractive place for
migrants in the future. The Zips Law and the experience of most developed countries indicates
that primate cities rarely change their place in the hierarchy of a national city system, and they
usually also remain the most attractive places for migrants. Their size also translates into a strong
gravitational pool – both for people and firms, and usually also for tourists. Primate cities are usually
also the easiest to get to, as they tend to be a country’s most important transport hub.

Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara are likely to be the runners-up for filling the secondary city gap,
so they are likely to be very attractive places for migrants in the future. Whether these two
cities manage to keep their leadership position also depends on how well they are managed, not only
on pure market dynamics. The Zipf Rule teaches us that secondary cities often lose their rank in a
country’s hierarchy, and it is usually human intervention, both by public and private actors, which
makes the difference.

While this may be a hard pill to swallow for most policy makers, it is likely that around 5-7
cities in Romania will attract an overwhelming share of internal migrants in the following
years. If this dynamic would happen in a context of overall population growth, all would be nice and
dandy. However, when this happens in a context of overall demographic decline, some places will
likely lose people that may never come back. Although it is unlikely to have a widespread phenomenon
of ghost towns/villages (even in countries with widespread migration, such as the US, this did not
happen), it is likely that many places will face socio-economic problems due to population decline.
Without a concentration of people and resources in a few dynamic places though, it will be hard for
the Romanian economy to stay competitive – no country has managed such a feat.




The Size and Location Effect
Figure11, earlier in the report, highlights a clear territorial development dynamic in Romania:
the West of the country has developed faster than the East and the South, and larger cities
have by and large fared better than smaller cities. Being close to the western border brings clear
advantages, as the West is generally preferred by investors due to the closer location to Western
European markets. The map below shows clearly the advantage of good location. Thus, localities
                                                                                     WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 63
                         inside the Carpathian Arc have a disproportionate share of their exports going to the EU (where 70%
                         of all Romanian exports go to), whereas localities in the East and South are less connected to the EU.

                        Larger cities have generally fared better than smaller cities, although not always. In the
                        North-East Region, it is the City of Iași, the largest urban area, which has developed the fastest; in
                        the South-East Region, it is Constanța that has had the best performance; and, in the South-West,
                        Craiova is the best performer. However, smaller cities from the West of the country, such as Sibiu or
                        Arad, have had higher productivity rates than these large cities from the East and the South.

                        Thus, geography and size matter for the attractiveness of the city. This is a pattern that can
                        be observed in almost every New EU Member Country. The World Bank has developed poverty maps
                        for most countries in Central and Eastern Europe and has witnessed this dynamic everywhere. Thus,
                        the regions closer to the EU core are more developed, and overall larger cities, particularly those in
                        good locations, do better than smaller cities.

The Proximity to Primacy Effect
Cities that are close to Bucharest suffered in the transition years, as a significant share
of their qualified labor force moved to the capital. Cities that are close to Bucharest, such as
Ploiești, Buzău, Constanța, Brăila, or Pitești, have sent a large number of migrants to the capital.
This dynamic has negatively affected those cities. However, as the economic cup of the capital has
gotten full, development is now spilling back to these urban centers. Given that salaries have been
growing continuously in Bucharest, many firms, particularly manufacturing firms, have moved to
nearby urban centers, in search of lower costs. Thus, while proximity to Bucharest was initially a
handicap, it may now turn into a boon.

The one-hour access area, by car, around the capital amasses a quarter of the population
in the country and generates a half of registered firm revenue – it is basically the economic
heart of Romania. Cities that are close to Bucharest, such as Ploiești, Buzău, Constanța, Brăila, or
Pitești, have sent a large number of migrants to the capital. This dynamic has negatively affected
those cities. However, as the economic cup has filled, benefits have started to spill over to these
neighboring cities. Given that salaries in Bucharest have been growing continuously, firms, particularly
manufacturing firms, are now locating around Bucharest, as a way of lowering costs, but still being
close to the “action”. 	

A good performance of the Romanian economy will inevitably entail a good performance of
this large urban agglomeration around Bucharest. This will require good connective infrastructure
in the region, to allow a seamless movement of people, goods, and ideas in the region. In addition, it will
be critical to do planning for the larger urban agglomeration rather than just for individual localities.
There are several large cities that anchor the urban agglomeration around Bucharest (Pitești to the
West; Târgoviște to the North-West; Ploiești and Brașov to the North; Constanța to the East; and,
Giurgiu to the South). The same way the Bos-Wash-Meg (the megalopolis stretching from Boston, via
New York and Philadelphia, to Washington, DC) functions as the economic heart of the US, so can
the Bucharest urban agglomeration function better as the economic heart of Romania.

The University and High Value-Added
Services Effect
                         A large enough pool of human capital is for several decades recognized by economists as
                         being one of the chief ingredients for sustained economic growth. Those that live in developing
                         countries know fully well that an educated population is not merely enough to sustain growth.
                         Without proper access to large markets, a good idea and or a good product/service can only go so
                         far. Even countries with state-of-the art education systems are not immune to the fickleness of the
                         economy. The Finns, although they have one of the best educated populations in the World, have
                         been in a recession since Nokia went belly-up.

                         Nonetheless, we do know that it is much easier to sustain economic growth if you do have
                         an educated population. Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Iași, the cities that have been
                         most successful in attracting migrants between 2001 and 2011, are also the strongest university
                         centers in Romania. However, at around the same population, Cluj-Napoca has an economy that is
                         more than twice as large as that of Iași – banking largely on its better geographic location (closer to
                         the rich markets in the West).


66 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Universities also play another critical role: they provide private firms with a continuous
supply of qualified labor force. Thus, cities without universities have a hard time competing with
large university centers. A traditional manufacturing town will always face some limits to growth, as
there is only so much one can raise the salary of a blue-collar worker, before the company becomes
un-competitive on global markets. On the other hand, in high value-added sectors, which require the
input of people with specialized expertise, salaries can grow in a much more flexible way. Ultimately,
the cities that can sustain growth are those that manage to generate high salary jobs that can
offset the rising cost of living in the respective cities.

The table below, indicates the FUAs with the highest concentration of people with higher
education. Obviously, the strongest university centers also have a high concentration of well educated
people. But, economic performance of the respective FUA also seems to be a factor in attracting
qualified people. Thus, Constanța, which is a less developed university center than Iași, has about the
same number of people with higher education. Sibiu and Târgu Mureș, which are more established
university centers than Ploiești and Pitești, have none-the-less fewer people with higher education.

                Ultimately however, a city cannot sustain growth if its private companies cannot continuously
                become more productive and offer higher salaries to their staff, and such growth cannot be
                sustained without a continuous supply of qualified people. Particularly for cities that have
                passed a certain development threshold, it is critical to be able to attract and retain human capital.
                There are few examples of boom-cities without a strong university nearby.




The Good Leadership Effect
                An unlimited supply of books on leadership tells us that good leaders can help turn the tide
                for a city. How much of a city’s performance is simply a result of market forces, and how much
                a result of human engineering, is hard to say, and even harder to estimate. The boundary between
                market force and human engineering is not as fine as we might like to think. Every decision taken by
                a person in the markets, is in effect also human engineering. The sum of these humanly engineered
                decisions is in fact what we call markets – Adam Smith’s “invisible hand”.

                However, the decisions taken by one person, or a few people, may have a larger impact than
                the sum of individual decisions taken. Mayors, and the decisions they take, do matter for a city’s
                competitiveness. Strong mayors play an active role in attracting high value-added investors, they
                allocate lots of energy and resources to raising the quality of life in their city, and they know how to
                build coalitions with the private sector and civil society representatives.




Land and Housing Markets
                Efficient and dynamic land and housing markets are critical for rapidly developing cities –
                when these markets work properly, the inflow of people and businesses is made easier. The
                World Bank has prepared for the Romanian Ministry of Regional Development, two analyses that
                discuss both land and housing markets in detail.

                The report “Enhanced spatial planning as a precondition for sustainable urban development”
                indicates that land markets in Romania are dysfunctional. For one, the ownership situation
                is not always clear. Following 1989, lands were restituted to their rightful owners, but ownership
                could not always be clearly established. As such, a significant share of urban land in Romania (it
                is not clear how much) has no clear ownership or is disputed in court. The figure below is evocative
                from this point of view. It represents one of the most prime pieces of real estate in Romania – the
                Esplanada site, around 11 hectares of land, right in the heart of Bucharest. Before communism, the
                site was part of the Jewish Quarter in Bucharest. During Communism, it was razed to the ground
                and a large Opera House was proposed for development there. When the Revolution of 1989 came,
                only the foundation of the Opera was finished. The transition years have seen many attempts at
                redeveloping this site, all of which have failed because of the murky ownership issues. As the figure
                below indicates, only 6% of the Esplanada site has been restituted to its rightful owners; 20% of the
                land is disputed in court; and, for 74% of the land no claim was made. Many parcels of urban and
                suburban land have a similar murky ownership structure.

Another key issue is the fragmentation of suburban and peri-urban land. Urban extension,
in the absence of clear and efficient spatial planning, has followed an “organic” pattern, going for
the point of easiest entry – i.e. plots of land where the owner could be identified and was willing to
sell, and were close enough to existent infrastructure networks (roads, water, wastewater, gas) to
make the development of these plots of land cost-effective. How this “organic” development looks in
practice is well evidenced by the image below, which showcases new developments in the Commune
of Florești, on the outskirts of Cluj-Napoca – the largest rural area in Romania now. Development of
this type is neither efficient nor sustainable nor desirable.

Lastly, the lack of a full functioning cadaster and the poor access to information on land
ownership (when ownership is actually known) are also important barriers to efficient land
development. Given that land is so fragmented, and given a relative penury of large, contiguous and
                                                                                   WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 69
                developable tracts of urban land, developers often face significant transaction costs in getting large
                enough pieces of land together. If the information on the land plots would be easy to access (e.g. if
                it would be easy to identify the owner and his/her contact information), some of these transaction
                costs would be lower.

                The report “Towards a National Housing Strategy” indicates that housing markets are also
                dysfunctional in Romania. For one, a combination of low affordability, high mortgage rates (10%-
                12%), high construction costs, and atomization of households (with a significant increase in the
                share of one-person households) has effectively skewed the demand for housing – in terms of type,
                quality, and size. Basically, an overwhelming share of new housing stock coming into the market is
                represented by small 1-2 room units (50-55 m2), for the most part being built in the most dynamic
                functional urban zones.

                Of the around 982,000 new housing units developed between 1990 and 2015, 64% were
                developed in the functional urban areas of Bucharest and the 40 county capitals. Moreover,
                around 52% of the housing units developed in these 41 FUAs (around 326,000 in total), were
                developed outside the core city, indicating a very rapid process of suburbanization. Most of these
                new developments were undertaken with a weak or absent spatial planning system. Particularly
                troublesome is the fact that although 52% of new units were developed in suburban and peri-urban
                areas, no efforts at metropolitan planning were undertaken. Of course, this un-controlled sprawl
                has clear negative effects on the cost of transport and other public infrastructure investments (e.g.
                water and wastewater, solid waste management, street lighting).

“Towards a National Housing Strategy” also notes the lack of a functioning rental market.
Unofficial figures indicate that around 15-20% of the housing stock in Bucharest and other major
cities are rental units, the large majority being rented out informally. The rental laws, which have a
strong pro-tenant bias, the high VAT, and the high taxes on rental income, have in essence stunted
the development of the rental market (few housing units are developed for the stated purpose of
being rented out) and have also sharply increased the incentives for buying rather than renting
housing units. This owner-renter imbalance can create perverse disincentives for mobility and can
artificially inflate housing prices in the most sought-after places. Largely, the places that have
attracted the most migrants in recent years, also have the highest property prices in Romania. If
property prices will keep going up in these places (a possible sign of the failure of land and housing
markets), they will act as a dis-incentive for potential in-migrants.

72 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Social Inclusion
Dynamic cities do not generate only positive effects – they can also create and exacerbate
existent cleavages. From a social point of view, cities that are growing at a very fast pace can end
up pricing out of the local economy entire groups of people. The example of high-school teachers that
cannot afford the rents in Silicon Valley are quite famous. Similar dynamics are underway in some
of the most dynamic cities in Romania. For example, dynamic sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, or
consulting, have continuously increased revenues for a number of people in Cluj-Napoca. This has
triggered a growth in rents, property prices, and generally in the cost of living (e.g. the price of a
meal at a restaurant). However, while IT specialists can afford these higher living costs, kindergarten
teachers cannot. A continued expansion of the IT sector in Cluj, may continue to widen the gap
between the haves and the have-nots. It is important therefore that policy makers address social
issues early on.

Urban marginalization in Romania has not yet reached alarming levels, but it is important that
social cleavages are addressed wherever they are encountered. The World Bank has prepared
for the Romanian Ministry of Regional Development an Atlas of Urban Marginalization, identifying
for all the towns and municipalities in the country the share of people living in marginalization.
By-and-large, the more developed cities also have a lower share of people living in marginalization,
while the less developed cities seem to fare worse. At the same time, it has to be noted that larger
and more developed cities, also have a higher absolute number of marginalized people. For example,
around 150,000 people in Bucharest live in areas disadvantaged on housing – more than the entire
population of 28 of the 40 county capitals. Obviously, dealing with marginalized groups in Bucharest
takes on a different magnitude than dealing with marginalized groups in Sfântu Gheorghe.

                      Similarly, it is important to also take into consideration marginalization in suburban and
                      peri-urban areas. Social inclusion policy often targets neighborhoods in center cities, as this is where
                      marginalization problems in Western countries are often the worst. However, unique data on urban
                      and rural marginalization in Romania has allowed the team to identify the extent of marginalization
                      in both core cities and extended functional urban area. Interestingly, in several FUAs in Romania,
                      marginalization is more of an issue in outlying areas than in the center city. For example, Brașov,
                      Constanța, Iași, Oradea, Târgu Mureș, Satu-Mare, Focșani, or Suceava, have a disproportional share
                      of their marginalized people living in the outter-core areas of the FUA. Obviously, in these instances,
                      social inclusion policies should be metropolitan, rather than urban or rural.

As Romanian cities will continue to develop, it is important that local and national policy
makers heed the lessons from more developed countries. A local economy is not really developed
when a certain share of the population, regardless how large or small, is living in marginalization.
Addressing social issues head-on is ultimately also good for overall economic performance, as socially
inclusive urban areas are often more developed areas.




Environmental Considerations
When one talks about a city’s attractiveness, one inevitably talks about centripetal forces
(which draw people and businesses in) and centrifugal forces (which push people out). When
centrifugal forces are discussed, environmental considerations usually rank highest. Obviously,
as cities develop, they also put a significant strain on the environment – e.g. land consumption,
de-forestation, CO2 emissions from increased car usage and industrial activity, more trash being
generated, more energy being consumed. The more un-sustainably cities develop, the more serious
the negative environmental side-effects tend to be. And, unfortunately, Romanian cities have not
developed in a sustainable way after 1989.
                                                                                         WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 75
                   The World Bank has studied sustainable development patterns in Bucharest and the 7
                   growth poles (Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Craiova, Iași, Ploiești, Timișoara) and has
                   identified many areas for improvement. For example, the report “A Technical Assessment of the
                   Energy and Emission Impacts of Alternative Development Patterns in the Bucharest-Ilfov Region”
                   has found that the uncontrolled sprawl of Bucharest has had adverse environmental side-effect,
                   many of which will be difficult to counter. Similarly, the TRACE (Tool for Rapid Assessment of City
                   Energy) reports for the 7 growth poles in Romania, have provide energy efficiency diagnostics which
                   highlight some of the key challenges faced by the largest secondary cities in Romania. Uncontrolled
                   sprawl, the growth in private car ownership and use, and dysfunctional public transport systems are
                   generally identified as some of the areas that have led to higher energy consumption and pollution
                   generation in these cities.




The “Je Ne Sais Quoi” Effect
                   As much as one tries to buttress markets, markets often have a mind of their own. Some
                   cities perform well despite poor leadership and poor location; while other cities struggle despite
                   having a strong administration, easy access to markets, and a strong university.

                   Currently, out of 254 primate and secondary cities in the EU, Romanian cities are the
                   fastest growing (see figure below). Why they have managed to have an almost universal good
                   performance is not clear. They likely performed better than Bulgarian cities because of the better
                   geographic location; their growth rate may fall down in coming years to resemble the growth rate of
                   Polish cities; and it may flatten to resemble the Spanish and Italian cities at some point in the future.

                   It is primate and secondary cities that drive the economic performance of a country. The
                   good performance of the growth poles in Romania is largely responsible for the good performance
                   of the Romanian economy. Between 2000 and 2013, all of the 8 growth pole grew faster than the
                   national economy, indicating that they were economic growth engines. As a comparison, in Bulgaria,
                   secondary cities like Varna or Plovdiv did worse than the national economy as a whole, which may
                   also explain the relatively poorer performance of the Bulgarian economy.

76 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Without dynamic secondary cities, Romania cannot stay competitive. To be competitive,
cities have to be attractive for people and firms. The next section will discuss in more detail some of
the factors that can help make a city more attractive.




A Categorization of Functional
Urban Areas
Everybody likes a ranking. Knowing where you are in certain pecking order can be both stimulating
and irritating – it’s hard to be neutral. And of course, popular magazines and researchers that want to
reach a larger audience, often resort to ranking of all sorts. There are rankings on city competitiveness,
quality of life, real estate prices, absorption of EU funds, or success in attracting tourists.

After 1989, cities in Romania have been categorized for normative and programmatic
reasons. The National Spatial Plan, Section IV on the Network of Settlements in Romania, has been
revised in 2016, organizing 103 municipalities, 217 towns, and 943 peri-urban villages in 8 categories:

        	    Category I – Capital City (Bucharest), of national importance, with a European
             and international vocation, the headquarter of the central administration and of
             European and international institutions.
        	    Category II – Main Regional Poles (Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Iași, Timișoara,
             Craiova), municipalities of national and trans-national importance, county residences,
             with a major role at the regional and cross-border level, headquarters for national and
             supranational institutions, large university centers; a population of more than 250,000
             and regional influence.
        	    Category III – Secondary Regional Poles (Bacău, Botoșani, Piatra-Neamț,
             Suceava, Brăila, Buzău, Galați, Pitești, Ploiești, Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Râmnicu Vâlcea,
             Arad, Baia Mare, Oradea, Satu Mare, Brașov, Sibiu, Târgu Mureș), municipalities of
             regional importance, county residences, headquarters for county and cross-county
             institutions, significant cultural centers; over 100,000 people and cross-county and
             cross-border influence.
        	    Category IV – Main County Poles (Alba Iulia, Alexandria, Bistrița, Călărași,
             Deva, Focșani, Giurgiu, Miercurea-Ciuc, Reșița, Sfântu Gheorghe, Slatina, Slobozia,
             Târgoviște, Târgu Jiu, Tulcea, Vaslui, Zalău), municipalities that are county residences,
             headquarters for county administrations; over 40,000 people.
        	    Category V – Secondary County Poles (40 municipalities), municipalities
             with a balancing role at the county level, with institutions that service a wider area
             (hospital, high-school, social assistance centers, employment agencies, museums,
             cultural centers, etc.); a population of over 20,000 and at least 50,000 in the area of
             influence.
        	    Category VI – Zonal Urban Centers (~110 municipalities and towns),
             municipalities and towns that cater to sub-county areas, smaller than secondary county
             poles; with a population of 5,000 to 20,000, and around 20,000-50,000 in the area of
             influence.
        	    Category VII – Specialized Urban Centers (~130 municipalities, towns,
             transport hubs, tourist resorts), municipalities and towns that are not included in
             Category VI, and which usually are subordinated to a Category I-V Municipality, with a
             mono-functional character (tourism, transport, energy, residency); size varies.
        	    Category VIII – Other Urban Localities (943 villages that are part of an
             urban administrative unit), villages and localities that are part of a municipality or town.
                                                                                      WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 77
                Cities have also been grouped for the implementation of EU funds. Thus, for the 2007-2013
                Programming Period, Axis 1 of the Regional Operational Programme had pre-allocated funds for 7
                growth poles (Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Craiova, Iași, Ploiești, and Timișoara) and 13 urban
                development poles (Arad, Baia-Mare, Bacău, Brăila, Galați, Deva, Oradea, Pitești, Râmnicu-Vâlcea,
                Satu Mare, Sibiu, Suceava, Târgu-Mureș). In addition, all urban areas with more than 10,000 people
                were eligible to compete for a pool of funds dedicated to them. The 7 growth poles are the largest
                cities in their respective regions (Bucharest-Ilfov, as the 8th region, did not receive dedicated funding,
                as it already reached a high development level), and by strengthening these growth poles, it was
                hoped that regional economies would be strengthened too.

                For the 2014-2020 Programming Period, Axis 4 of the Regional Operational Programme
                provides dedicated funding for 39 county capitals. Tulcea, the 40th county capital, receives
                dedicated funding through the Danube Delta Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI). Axis 3 of the
                ROP provides funding, on a competitive basis to all other urban areas.

                Migration and commuter patterns are other variables that work well for establishing sub-
                national hierarchies. Particularly migration numbers, provide a good proxy for the success of a
                city, or functional urban area (FUA). The FUAs that manage to attract the most people, particularly
                well-qualified human capital, are usually those that provide the proper package of incentives (e.g.
                jobs, good education, quality healthcare, affordable housing, good quality of life). Of course, the size
                of migration inflows is not an immediate indication of good economic performance, but, by and
                large, larger cities and cities that manage to attract people are both more productive and more
                dynamic than other cities in that particular country.

                Another issue that migration flows are relevant for, is the determination of a FUA’s
                gravitational field – i.e. the area a FUA manages to attract people from. Global cities like
                New York, Paris, or London, attract people from all over the World. Continental hubs like Muenchen,
                Barcelona, or Milano, are attractive for people from several countries. National hubs like Bucharest,
                Warsaw, or Bratislava, are primarily interesting for the people within those countries. Regional hubs,
                like Cluj-Napoca, Poznan, or Kosice, are primarily attractive to people within that particular region.

                Obviously, the larger the gravitational field of a particular FUA, the better off that FUA will
                be. A city like London can attract qualified people from all over the World, and thus has the proper
                resources for sustained growth. A regional hub will be only as performant as the people it already has
                and the people it will attract from within the region. Obviously, a FUA that is attractive to human
                capital from all over the World is better off than a FUA that is only attractive to a limited number
                of people.

                Cities are in a global competition for the best and most qualified people, and the cities that
                have the largest gravitational field and the strongest gravitational pull, will also be the
                most developed. While Romania has no global or continental hubs, it has to strengthen its most
                successful FUAs – both as a way of curbing out-migration and as a way of strengthening regional
                economies. The number of emigrants is much larger than the number of in-migrants (3 million
                emigrants as opposed to 1.8 million in-country-migrants, between 1991 and 2011), and without
                strong and attractive urban areas, Romania cannot hope to reverse this negative trend. Moreover,
                without strong urban areas, one cannot have strong regions. The performance of almost every
                leading region in the EU is linked to the performance of its main FUAs.

                In what follows, we will discuss the main categories of FUAs in Romania, based on how successful
                they have been in attracting people, and based on their area of influence. This analysis will also
                indicate which FUAs can best sustain regional growth and development. We will also discuss how
                these FUAs could be strengthened, and thus help their economies perform better. Annex 2, includes
                a statistical clustering of FUAs using a dendogram methodology, and the end results are quite close
                to the ranking discussed below.




78 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
The National Magnet
Bucharest, the primate city in Romania, and the capital, is the most attractive urban area
in the Country. People have moved to Bucharest from virtually every locality in Romania, although
a disproportional number of people moved from the areas around Bucharest, and from other large
urban centers. It is likely that, similar to other primate cities around the World, Bucharest will
continue to be attractive to Romanians even if public authorities don’t do anything about it. In
essence, Bucharest does not have competition within the country. However, it is important that
local authorities in Bucharest gear up for an international competition, and think about what needs
to be done to transform Bucharest in a continental hub.

Interestingly, Bucharest has a higher GDP per Capita than other capitals in Central and
Eastern Europe, but it still has some way to go until it becomes as attractive as these
capitals. Bucharest is more developed than Lisbon, but nowhere near as cosmopolitan. The city,
and the larger FUA, have attracted a lot of foreign investment, but not a lot of foreign people. In
2015, according to the Romanian General Inspectorate for Immigration, 30,000 foreign citizens
lived in Bucharest (30% of all immigrants in Romania) – 1.6% of the total city’s population. Most
immigrants came from China (4,234), Turkey (3,210), Syria (2,109), and Iraq (1,720). The largest
sending countries in the EU include Italy (1,748), France (1,447), Greece (813), and Germany (810). In
Romania, overall, only 0.5% of the population comes from somewhere else. By comparison, 3.5% of
Portugal’s population comes from outside Portugal.

                                                                                   WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 79
                To become a continental hub, local authorities in Bucharest should work harder at making
                the city more attractive to expats. Some of the key interventions that should be considered
                include:

                       1.	 Urbanism. Bucharest is rich, but it does not look the part. Streets and sidewalks are in
                           poor shape, buildings are poorly maintained and are often falling apart, historical areas
                           are in a state of disrepair, and many apartment block neighborhoods have not seen any
                           intervention since 1989. First impressions count, and the more coifed a city is, the more
                           people it is likely to attract.

                       2.	 Airport. The easier it is to reach a city the more people are likely to come – especially if
                           the city has something to show. The airport in Bucharest has one of the fastest passenger
                           growth rates in Europe. In 2011 it handled around 5 million passengers, and in 2016 that
                           figure went up to 11 million. The airport infrastructure has not however kept up with the
                           dynamic, and it faces concrete challenges in handling more passengers and flights in
                           the future. The Bucharest Airport handles about the same number of passengers as the
                           airport in Warsaw (Poland), but the airport infrastructure is significantly smaller.

                       3.	 Public Transport. Bucharest is one of the densest and most compact cities in Europe,
                           and it has a good public transport system. However, the public transport system is
                           very hard to use for someone that is not familiar with it, and for people who don’t
                           speak Romanian. It is important to make public transport stops visible and retrofit
                           them with clear guidance on time-tables and routes serviced, and wherever possible, the
                           information should also be provided in English.

                       4.	 Enforcement of Rules and Regulations. Romania excels in the elaboration of laws,
                           rules, and regulations, but leaves much to be desired when it comes to actually enforcing
                           these rules and regulations. Bucharest is an epitome of the failure of enforcement. Cars
                           are parked everywhere (often forcing pedestrians to walk on the road), although the law
                           prohibits it; sidewalks are not cleaned of snow in the winter although owners are obliged
                           to clear the area in front of their building; the aged stucco on buildings is often falling
                           on pedestrians, although the law obliges property owners to rehab these buildings. This
                           lack of enforcement, and lack of order, may be charming for some, but it tends to be
                           off-putting for most foreign nationals – particularly for those coming from countries
                           with a clear enforcement of rules.

                       5.	 Quality Education. Particularly for foreign nationals that come with their families to
                           Bucharest, the availability of quality education for their kids is important. There are a
                           number of good international schools in Bucharest, but these tend to be very expensive
                           and very hard to reach (many are in peripheral neighborhoods).

                       6.	 Metropolitan Infrastructure. 330,000 people commute across administrative
                           boundaries in the Bucharest FUA every day, and the number will likely continue to grow in
                           coming years, with more and more people (including expats) preferring the suburbs to the
                           center city. As such, Bucharest is in dire need of revamping its connective infrastructure.
                           There are plans to complete the city’s ring road and upgrade it to four lanes, and develop
                           a highway belt, which will connect the A1 (to Ploiești), A2 (to Constanța), and the A3
                           (to Ploiești and Brașov) highways. The metro system will be expanded to service the
                           airport and a number of large and growing neighborhoods. The bus system will be
                           extended to services commuter localities in Ilfov County, and the tram system will be
                           modernized. In addition, there are plans for several park-and-ride facilities, which would
                           make commuting by public transport easier and more efficient.

          7.	 Regional Infrastructure. The functional urban area of Bucharest extends way beyond
              its administrative borders. The two gravitational maps below show the concentration of
              the population and of economic activity in the South Region, with the entirety of the
              Bucharest-Ilfov Region cut out. What becomes immediately evident is that economic
              activity of the capital region has started to spill well beyond the boundaries of Ilfov
              County. However, this economic activity has followed the path of least resistance – i.e.
              it has primarily clustered along the A1 Highway from Bucharest to Pitești and along the
              DN1 National Road from Bucharest to Ploiești. The demographic gravity model indicates,
              on the other hand, that the area bounded by Bucharest, Ploiești, Târgoviște, and Pitești,
              has a very high population density (it is in fact the densest population area in Romania),
              but not necessarily a lot of economic activity. The proper development of connective and
              business infrastructure in this area could catalyze and attract private sector activity.
              For example, the National Transport Masterplan provides for an Expressway that will
              connect Ploiești to Târgoviște and the A1 Highway, and for a modernized four-lane road
              connecting Târgoviște to Bucharest. These infrastructure projects could help catalyze
              development in an area with a very strong development potential.

Obviously, making Bucharest more attractive to expats, should not trump making the
city more attractive and livable for the people living there. These two goals are almost never
mutually exclusive, and Bucharest still has a long way to go before adequately answering the needs
of its current citizens. For example, the public transport system is not functional at the metropolitan
level and still has some ways to go in terms of efficiency and quality; housing, both old and new,
is generally of poor quality and requires upgrading, modernization, and retrofitting (e.g. seismic
retrofitting); public spaces are often in a state of disrepair and neglect; congestion, pollution, and
the lack of parking places are repeatedly on the list of discontents with the residents of Bucharest;
the airport infrastructure is hopelessly under-developed and has difficulties dealing with the rapidly
growing air traffic flow.

                          The Regional Magnets
                          Identifying the secondary cities in a country with the biggest promise is neither easy nor
                          foolproof. Different cities do well on different indicators, and unlike the primate city, they are in a
                          constant competition with each other. Such hierarchies are also not exactly conducive to making
                          friends – there are only a few spots at the top, and a lot of spots further down. Nonetheless, there
                          is merit in identifying, or trying to identify the top performers – it enables better policy making and
                          a better targeting of public investments.

                          Migration numbers provide a good proxy for FUA performance, and the most attractive FUAs
                          outside Bucharest are Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, and Iași. They did not only have the highest
                          number of migrants after Bucharest, between 2001 and 2011 (83,000, 82,000, and 61,000 people
                          respectively), but also the highest share of migrants in the total population (16.5%, 17.4%, and 14.7%
                          respectively). Timișoara and Cluj-Napoca also perform well on a number of other socio-economic
                          indicators: GDP, GDP per Capita, Firm Turnover, Average Salary, Real Estate Prices. They all do
                          well on human capital measures, such as: Number of Students, Share of Population with Higher
                          Education, Share of Young People, Share of People Working in High Value-Added Activities.

                          Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, and Iași also performed well in terms of their area of influence.
                          The map below shows which of the 7 growth poles defined for the Regional Operational Programme
                          2007-2013 have the largest areas of influence – i.e. the counties where a majority of migrants moved
                          to that particular county.

82 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
What becomes immediately clear when looking at this map is that although there are
8 regions in Romania, the country seems to be de facto split between 4 major areas of
influence – that of Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Iași. What also becomes clear is
that, again, distance from primacy matters. The economic performance of the growth poles close
to Bucharest (i.e. Constanța, Brașov, Craiova, and Ploiești), was affected by this proximity. Think
only of the performance of the universities in these cities. As we discussed earlier, universities are a
major magnet for migrants. However, the universities in the growth poles close to Bucharest could
not develop fully, as they had a tough competition from the universities in the capital. The Bucharest
universities managed to attract not only the lion’s share of students in the area, but also most of
the university professors. On the other hand, distance has been a boon for Cluj-Napoca, Iași, and
Timișoara, enabling them to grow as strong university centers, attract human capital from the
region, and thus become dynamic economic hubs

These three cities also have the right pre-requisites to sustain economic growth – they
perform well on the Hachman Index. The Hachman Index measures the complexity of a local
economy as compared to the national economy. The closer a locality’s Hachman Index is to 1, the
more the economy of that locality resembles the national economy. Among the 7 growth poles, Cluj-
Napoca, Iași, and Timișoara registered the highest values (see figure below). A locality with a diverse
economy can much better hedge risk and volatility than mono-industrial towns, or than cities with
a few dominant sectors.

Source: World Bank. 2013. Growth Poles: The Next Phase


This dynamic, of course, poses an interesting conundrum. The Growth Poles policy, devised for
the 2007-2013 Programming Period, aimed to strengthen the largest cities in the 7 regions outside
Bucharest-Ilfov, and thus strengthen regional economies. The intentions of the policy were very
good, but it is possible that the outcomes do not necessarily correspond to what was intended. The
capacity of 4 of the growth poles to spread growth to surrounding areas is limited by the influence
of other large urban centers. For example, in the South Region, Bucharest plays the dominant role.
In the South-East Region, Bucharest exercises a powerful draw for people in four of the counties in
the region – Brăila, Buzău, Galați, and Vrancea. Constanța exercises a more powerful draw on the
people in Constanța County and Tulcea County. The Cluj-Napoca FUA exercises a powerful draw
on 4 counties in the Center Region – Alba, Harghita, Mureș, and Sibiu. Brașov dominates migration
                                                                                                                          WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 83
                flows in only two counties in the Center Region – Brașov County and Covasna County. The areas
                of influence in the South-West Region are divided between Bucharest (Olt and Vâlcea counties),
                Timișoara (Gorj and Mehedinți counties), and Craiova (Dolj County).

                Romania requires a clear urban development policy that takes such dynamics into
                consideration. Strengthening functional urban areas with the highest potential, especially when
                key interventions are outside their means (e.g. metropolitan connective infrastructure), is absolutely
                critical for strengthening regional economies. Some of the key issues that could be considered include:

                        1.	 Universities. Universities play an important role in migration, and a particularly
                            important role in countries with demographic decline. When a university is located in
                            a large city with a diverse economic base, it provides a constant flow of qualified labor
                            to the businesses in the area. Moreover, it enables the emergence of high value-added
                            businesses and economic sectors, and, when the local economy is mature enough, it
                            enables the generation of innovation and technological change. In a context where the
                            general population is aging (the number of people aged 0-24, in Romania, dropped
                            from 9.3 million in 1990 to 5.6 million in 2016), universities also supply a constant,
                            albeit decreasing flow of young people. 62% of students in Romania go to one of the
                            universities in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iași, and Timișoara. Having access to cutting
                            edge research and the best qualified professors in the West, being able to do applied
                            research, and building strong links to the private sector are only some measures that
                            can help strengthen the universities in these regional magnets.
                        	
                        2.	 Private Sector Development. Without a strong private sector, universities don’t help
                            too much. If students don’t have jobs when they graduate, there is not much to keep
                            them in the area. Private sector development has to be done however in a purposeful way.
                            A large majority of local authorities in Romania are only too happy to receive whatever
                            private investment comes their way, but few actually take the time to purposefully
                            focus on a number of high value-added investors. Business infrastructure is important in
                            attracting and keeping investors, but good negotiation and communication skills, and
                            the ability to build and maintain partnerships, matters more.
                        	
                        3.	 Quality of Life. While the notion of quality of life is rather esoteric and difficult to
                            put in a neat formula, we all innately know it matters. We like to visit cities that are
                            beautiful, we prefer to live in nice neighborhoods, we spend our free time in cozy areas,
                            and we seem to be more productive when we are in a well designed space. Investing in
                            public art, culture, and urban design is neither trifle nor expensive – one can have big
                            impact with little money. Moreover, it is likely that cities will increasingly include good
                            urban design in the arsenal of measures required to win hearts and funds.
                        	
                        4.	 Clusters. Another thing to keep in mind is that people like to cluster. When they move
                            to a different place, they often prefer places where there are more people like them. As
                            the saying goes, “birds of a feather flock together”. Now, when you start working for a
                            company you like, you inevitably will be surrounded by like-minded people. But the more
                            such companies are in the area, the better – particularly for the creative class, which
                            thrives on being able to exchange ideas with others. Local authorities can lend support
                            to innovation and business hubs, and facilitate the mingling of professionals, academics,
                            and civil society.
                        	
                        5.	 Connectivity. Connectivity is important for migration from two points of view:
                            a) making it easier for people to move to the place; b) making it easier to keep the
                            connection to the place of origin. Thriving urban areas are almost always important
                            transport hubs. The development of better connective infrastructure is inevitable when

84 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
            a city is growing, but careful and strategic planning can ensure that this connective
            infrastructure is developed in an efficient and sustainable way. Of particular importance
            will be the extension and modernization of airport infrastructure, with air traffic
            growing continuously to and from these important economic hubs. Of importance will
            also be the development of metropolitan transport infrastructure, and metropolitan
            public transport. The FUAs of Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, and Iași have a high number
            of commuters (around 50,000 people commute every day to and within these FUAs),
            but they all lack the infrastructure required to accommodate all these commuters. For
            example, the stretch of road between Cluj-Napoca and Florești (Cluj-Napoca’s largest
            suburb, and the largest village in Romania) has the highest traffic numbers in the
            country and the highest incidence of traffic accidents.
        	
        6.	 Metropolitan Spatial Planning. A significant number of people will likely continue
            to move to these regional magnets, and it is important that all these new people are
            accommodated in an efficient and sustainable way. Local authorities do not have to
            build housing for all in-migrants, but they can ensure that new housing developments are
            done in an efficient and sustainable way. In the past years, new housing neighborhoods
            have gone up in a haphazard and speculative way, with no space allocated for parks,
            wide enough streets and sidewalks, public institutions (e.g. schools, clinics), and not in
            an urbanistically coordinate way. Worse over, even when a good spatial plan has been
            elaborated for the center city of a FUA, it was not done in a coordinated manner at the
            full metropolitan level – although new private investments and housing developments
            tend to be completed in suburban and peri-urban areas.
        	
        7.	 Capacity. Regional magnets are not lonely rocks in the sea – they are part of complex
            and dynamic functional zones, and their well-being hinges, to a significant extent, on
            how well they are able to cooperate with other stakeholders (e.g. neighboring localities,
            private sector, civil society, county and national authorities). Without such strong
            partnerships, regional magnets risk to be less competitive – which is particularly bad if
            they hope to compete on equal footing with secondary cities in the EU.

It is important to remember though that policies geared to attract migrants, should not be seen as
a zero-sum game (with a few cities in competition for potential migrants), nor should these policies
be promoted at the expense of the people and firms already located in a particular FUA (e.g. export
promotion, encouraging entrepreneurship and new firm formation, or the efficient provision of basic
services).




The Cross-County Magnets
Cross-county Magnets are FUAs that received at least 25,000 migrants between 2001 and
2011, from at least two counties. In this group we have Constanța, Brașov, Ploiești, Pitești,
Oradea, Arad, Sibiu, Târgu Mureș, and Craiova. These FUAs are a mixed bag, and it is difficult
to find clear traits that bind them together. There are commonalities nonetheless. We will discuss
some of these in what follows.




                                                                                   WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 85

Note: The map indicates, by locality, where the largest share of migrants went to.

86 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
All cross-county magnets are university centers of sub-regional importance, and together
they attract 26% of all students in Romania. Each cross-county magnet had between 7,600
and 24,000 students in 2015, and their universities helped attract younger migrants. Strengthening
these university centers will be an important step towards stronger FUAs.

Several of the cross-county magnets are important tourism hubs in Romania. The counties of
Constanța, Brașov, Mureș (where Târgu Mureș is located), Prahova (where Ploiești is located), and
Sibiu, are the largest tourist destinations after Bucharest. Bihor (where Oradea is located) and Arad
are other important tourist destinations. Among the 41 FUAs considered here, the FUAs of Brașov,
Constanța, Sibiu, Târgu Mureș, and Oradea have the highest concentration of tourists (number of
tourists compared to total FUA population). The fact that they are attractive to tourists indicates
that they may be attractive to some migrants too. If you like a spot enough to visit it, you also
consider living there. Investments in quality of life are therefore critical for these cities.

All cross-county magnets are also important commuter hubs. The FUAs of Ploiești, Pitești,
and Constanța receive the highest number of daily commuters after the FUA of Bucharest – around
69,000, 60,000, and 53,000 commuters respectively. Brașov, Oradea, Arad, Sibiu, Târgu Mureș,
and Craiova, also are in the top with respect to the number of commuters they attract, with around
51,000, 35,000, 32,000, 23,000, 22,000, and 20,000 daily commuters respectively. When daily
traffic numbers on a road (which most often include transit flows, not just commuter flows) exceeds
15,000, it is recommended that the respective road be upgraded to a highway. This in itself indicates
that all of the cross-county magnets will require an upgrade of their metropolitan connective
infrastructure. For the 2014-2020 Programming Period, all county residences had to develop mobility
plans and indicate the needed investments in connective infrastructure through 2030.

With the exception of Constanța, which is a logistics, tourism, and oil processing hub,
and Târgu Mureș, which houses a large energy company, all over cross-county magnets are
significant industrial hubs, and several of them are dependent on one large or several large
companies. The FUAs of Pitești (where Dacia, the largest car manufacturer in Romania is located),
Târgu Mureș (with eON Energy and Distribution), and Brașov (where several automobile component
manufacturers are located), generate the largest firm revenues per employee after Bucharest. These
are industrial hubs of significant importance for the Romanian economy. Constanța, Arad, Ploiești,
Sibiu, and Oradea, also rank high on this metric, as they house big industrial plants with large
exports. The table below ranks FUAs based on total firm revenues they generate.

All of the other cross-county magnets are significant economic hubs. Some of these industrial hubs, such as
Arad, have reached an upper threshold, with much of the able labor force in the area being gainfully employed, and with
88 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
difficulties of sustaining regional growth because of the lack of labor force. Others, like Craiova, still
have many people in the area that are not yet gainfully employed. Almost all of the cross-county
magnets, now have a significant share of economic output being generated in outter areas – 36% of
all firm revenues generated by cross-county magnets are generated in outer FUA areas (i.e. suburban
and peri-urban areas). This metropolitan dynamic is typical of industrial centers, with a significant
share of industrial activity being located on the outskirts of cities.

Strengthening these cross-county hubs will require will require interventions both from the
national level, and from the regional and local level. Given that cross-county magnets have a
weaker gravitational pool than the regional magnets (they usually attract migrants from around 2
counties), their capacity to sustain growth is inevitably limited. All of the cross-county magnets,
with the exception of Târgu Mureș, have less than 100,000 people of 0-29 years of age, in their
respective counties and outside the FUA area – i.e. the people that have the highest likelihood of
migrating to the FUA, given their small migration catchment area and given the small number of
people that could potentially migrate. Cross-county magnets will likely have limited long-term growth
potential, unless they manage to attract migrants from abroad. Some key interventions that could
be taken into consideration include:

        1.	 Universities. As is the case for regional magnets, cross-county magnets need to
            strengthen their universities, as these will constitute the main draw for a young and
            well-educated population. However, the focus should be on strengthening niche academic
            areas where these FUAs have a comparative advantage. For example, Constanța has a
            strong Naval Academy and Ploiești has a strong Petroleum and Gas University. In addition
            to niche fields, cross-country magnets should strengthen links with companies in the
            area, and try to cater to their needs. For example, these companies could teach courses
            on topics of interest to them. Lastly, a stronger focus should be given to engineering
            fields, given the importance industry plays in the economies of cross-county magnets.
        	
        2.	 Quality of Life. Tourism is an important source of revenue for several of the cross-
            county magnets (e.g. Constanța, Brașov, Sibiu, Oradea, Arad), and this attractiveness
            for visitors is likely to also encourage migration. It is therefore important to play on these
            strengths and attempt to enhance them. This means that local authorities should work
            on: improving building facades; repairing and modernizing sidewalks, plazas, and public
            spaces; modernizing, rehabilitating and extending green spaces and parks; improving
            public transport and making it more accessible and easy-to-use for foreign tourists;
            investing in culture and public art.
        	
        3.	 Connective Infrastructure and Public Transport. Cross-county magnets attract a
            large number of commuters, particularly large industrial centers like Ploiești, Pitești,
            Brașov, Oradea, or Arad. This will require a rehabilitation, modernization, and extension
            of their transport infrastructure, to enable the seamless movement of people within the
            FUA. All county residences were obliged to elaborate mobility plans, and these mobility
            plans will likely include the key projects required to make the entire area more accessible.
            Unfortunately, only the growth poles (Constanța, Brașov, Craiova, and Ploiești) were
            required to elaborate the mobility plan for the metropolitan area. For FUAs like Oradea,
            Pitești, Sibiu, or Arad, which have very low unemployment, the challenge will be to enable
            easy commuting from more distant areas.
        	
        4.	 Metropolitan Spatial Planning. As is the case for the regional magnets, the cross-
            county magnets have strong metropolitan dynamics. Particularly when it comes to
            metropolitan transport infrastructure and housing, it is important to have cogent and
            coherent metropolitan spatial plans that ensure efficient and sustainable infrastructure
            development.

                                     5.	 Private Sector Development. Unemployment is not exactly a problem for cross-county
                                         magnets (they are among the FUAs in Romania that have benefited from significant
                                         private investments in the past years), but a dearth of high value-added investments
                                         is indeed a problem. Many of the firms operating in these FUAs offer relatively low
                                         salaries, and some only offer the minimum salary. Thus, while there are plenty of jobs
                                         in these FUAs they are not always high quality jobs. Local authorities should therefore
                                         allocate both time and attention to continually strengthening innovative sectors and
                                         attracting high value-added investments.
                                     	
                                     6.	 Vocational Education. Cross-county hubs are not high value-added service driven
                                         economy. The companies operating in these FUAs require labor force that caters to
                                         their needs. Thus, the tourism industry in Constanța likely requires people that have
                                         a training in hospitality. Industrial centers like Oradea or Sibiu require people with
                                         vocational training, or on-the-job training, rather than people with a Ph.D. in philosophy.
                                     	
                                     7.	 Capacity. As is the case of regional markets, cross-county magnets require strong
                                         partnerships and coalitions with a variety of stakeholders (private sector, public sector,
                                         NGOs, and civil society) if they are to thrive.



                          The County Magnets
                          County magnets are FUAs that have attracted more than 10,000 migrants between 2001
                          and 2011, primarily from the county they were part of. County magnets include 13 FUAs:
                          Bacău, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Buzău, Galați, Târgoviște, Suceava, Satu Mare, Focșani, Baia Mare,
                          Târgu Jiu, Alba Iulia, Piatra Neamț, Bistrița. These FUAs are more of a motley crue than the
                          cross-country magnets. To the extent that there are common threads, these apply usually to groups
                          of FUAs rather than to all county magnets.

90 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Four of the county magnets (Bacău, Piatra Neamț, Suceava, and Târgoviște) are latent
urbanizers. These FUAs have a large population pool around them, which, if offered the proper
opportunities, could migrate to and strengthen these FUAs. The map above showcases the population
aged 0 to 29 in 2011, located within the particular county, but outside the FUA. This population
group is, according to the data on migration we have collected, the most likely to migrate, and the
most likely to contribute to urban growth in these latent urbanizers.

Virtually all of the county magnets require a strengthening of the private sector. The share
of the active population is below the national average for all county magnets, and the same is the
case for average salaries at the county level (see table below). The basic recommendation for the
local authorities in charge of the county magnets is to strategically focus on attracting private
investors, which could best take advantage of the labor force available in the area. By and large,
county magnets have a labor force that does not have higher education, and the areas from which
they attract migrants is relatively limited and primarily rural in nature. As such, most of the county
magnets will require additional industry sector investments.

                          Several of the county magnets have good tourism potential, and they should exploit this
                          advantage. Alba Iulia is home to the largest Vauban Fortress in Romania, and one of the most
                          important and appreciated tourist attractions in the country. Bistrița and Baia Mare have beautiful
                          historic centers, and are surrounded by several tourist attractions (e.g. the UNESCO wooden churches
                          in Maramureș, the Săpânța Cemetery, the “Dracula” Bârgău pass – where Bram Stoker placed
                          the action of his „Dracula” novel). Suceava and Piatra Neamț are surrounded by several historical,
                          cultural, and natural sites of importance (e.g. the UNESCO painted monasteries).

                          County magnets are also, surprisingly, important commuter hubs. In the FUAs of Târgoviște,
                          Alba Iulia, Piatra Neamț, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Buzău, Focșani, Suceava, Baia Mare, Târgu Jiu, more
                          than 20% of the work force commutes across administrative borders for work. This in itself will
                          require some measure of metropolitan planning. All of the county magnets receive more than 10,000
                          commuters every day, and some (e.g. Târgoviște, Buzău, Râmnicu Vâlcea, and Bacău) receive more
                          than 20,000 commuters daily. Târgoviște, in fact, receives more commuters than Craiova.




92 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Key recommendations for the county magnets include:

       1.	 Private Sector Development. The key word for local authorities in county magnets
           should be investments, investments, investments. They face a particular tough challenge
           keeping people, particularly those with higher education, from moving somewhere else,
           so it is important that they provide people with opportunities – particularly well-paying
           jobs. If FUAs like Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, Sibiu, Oradea, Arad, Brașov, will naturally
           attract investments, county magnets will have to be more purposeful in their efforts.
           The focus will be primarily on industrial enterprises, but to the extent possible these
           industrial enterprises should be high value-added ones. The most developed NUTS 3
           regions in the EU are Wolfsburg and Ingolstadt, cities of around 125,000 people (like
           the county magnets in Romania), and home to Volkswagen and Audi. County magnets
           could follow a similar model and become industrial super-powers, although they will
           have to guard against the pitfalls of high specialization in just one sector, or in a few
           sector. Unfortunately, given their smaller size, county magnets don’t have the luxury of
           a heterogeneous and efficient economic base – they are much better off, if the limited
           labor force they have specializes in one or a few sectors.
       	
       2.	 Vocation Education. Because of their small size, county magnets will find it harder to
           attract high value-added service industries. Most will rely on industrial enterprises to
           fuel their growth and development. And, of course, these industrial enterprises require
           people with the proper training and willingness to work in the sector they cover. Local
           authorities in county magnets can play an important role in matching people to jobs
           and they can help facilitate on-the-job learning, as well as strengthening the vocational
           education system.
       	
       3.	 Regional Connective Infrastructure. County magnets have a relatively high share
           of commuters, have industrial facilities that increasingly locate in peri-urban areas,
           and have tourist attractions in nearby locations. As is the case for the other magnets,
           county magnets would benefit from a focus on the rehabilitation, modernization, and
           extension of county level connective infrastructure – particularly county roads and local
           roads. A strong cooperation and joint planning with county councils is critical in this
           respect. This connective infrastructure will not only facilitate commuting, but will also
           facilitate the process of urbanization, enabling the strengthening of some urban areas
           with high population density around them.
       	
       4.	 Urban Regeneration. With the exception of the cities with well defined historic centers
           (Bistrița, Baia Mare, Alba Iulia), the dominating feature of county magnets is that they
           were primarily developed during Communism. Communist apartment blocks is the
           defining feature of these cities, and it is a feature that has not weathered the test of
           time very well. Many of the Communist apartment blocks have surpassed their warranty
           period, most have not received any major improvements in the past years, and facades
           have been scarred by interventions of private owners (e.g. closing of balconies, changing
           of window panes, painting of facades). Consequently, most of these apartment blocks
           look like dirty Christmas trees today and require urgent intervention. A drop in the
           quality of living spaces (including the areas around apartment blocks – e.g. green spaces,
           pedestrian paths, playgrounds) will inevitably lead to a drop in quality of life, which may
           increase the likelihood that people in the county magnets will chose to move elsewhere.
       	
       5.	 Quality of Life. Some of the county magnets have beautiful historic cores that deserve
           to be rehabilitated and improved – both for the benefit of people living there, and as a
           way of attracting more tourists.
       	


                                                                                   WHAT MAKES CITIES ATTRACTIVE I 93
                        6.	 Capacity. Local authorities in county magnets need to be properly equipped for
                            efficiently accessing EU and State-Budget funds (they often lack the means required to
                            improve much needed development infrastructure). Moreover, they need a strengthening
                            of their capacity to implement multi-annual investment programs, and their capacity to
                            attract, keep, and nurture high value-added investors.




                The Local Magnets
                Local magnets are those FUAs that have largely attracted less than 10,000 migrants
                between 2001 and 2011, and have a migration catchment area that is rather local (i.e. a
                sub-region in the county). The local magnets include 15 FUAs: Deva, Miercurea Ciuc, Zalău,
                Drobeta Turnu Severin, Sfântu Gheorghe, Slobozia, Vaslui, Giurgiu, Botoșani, Călărași,
                Reșița, Slatina, Alexandria, Tulcea, and Brăila. Interestingly, among the poor performers in this
                category we find Brăila (which is a historical and cultural heritage jewel, and a former rich port on
                the Danube) and Slatina (which is doing very well economically, housing two large industrial giants –
                ALRO Slatina and Pirelli). Local magnets are largely the FUAs that have fared worst in the transition
                years. Overall they have failed to attract large investors (with a few exceptions, such as Slatina),
                a significant share of their labor force works for the public sector, and they have lost a significant
                share of their qualified labor force to bigger magnets in Romania, and to emigration.

                While the challenges local magnets face vary, all of them have to focus proactively and
                aggressively on attracting investments. Without decent well-paid jobs, it will be difficult for local
                magnets to stem the tide of out-migration and continue to attract people from surrounding rural
                areas. Most of them do not have a lot of potential people they could attract to begin with, given their
                small area of influence. Attracting, creating, and keeping private capital should be the main priority
                and area of focus for local administrations of local magnets. Without a strong private sector, these
                FUAs stand little chance of performing well in the future.

                Most of the local magnets will inevitably require assistance from the central government –
                both funds for development and technical assistance for strengthening local capacity. For
                example, most face difficulties in maintaining and upgrading their public utilities networks, they
                lack qualified people to run the local administration, and they usually lack a proper vision for the
                future. Some of the local magnets, such as Brăila, require targeted national programs of their own.
                Romania cannot afford to lose the cultural and historical heritage of Brăila. A similar approach
                should be considered for the industrial heritage in Reșița, where the building blocks of the Eifel Tower
                were crafted. Tulcea, or rather the Danube Delta, already benefit from an integrated territorial
                investment for the 2014-2020 Programming Period, with €1.3 billion allocated for territorially
                targeted interventions in the Danube Delta. The Romanian Government has also expressed interest
                in developing integrated territorial investments for the Valea Jiului mining areas (in Hunedoara
                County, close to Deva), and for a larger poor area around Vaslui County.

                Other local magnets can strengthen their economic base, by strengthening ties with the
                larger magnets around them. An easy flow of people may encourage some out-migrants to move
                back and invest at home. For example, Giurgiu, Călărași, Slobozia, Alexandria can benefit from their
                proximity to Bucharest; Reșița and Deva could benefit from their proximity to Timișoara; Zalău can
                benefit from its proximity to Cluj-Napoca; Botoșani and Vaslui can benefit from their proximity to
                Iași, although the Iași FUA is not yet strong enough to spill over economic benefits that far; Tulcea
                can benefit from its proximity to Constanța; Sfântu Gheorghe benefited from its proximity to Brașov.




94 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
How Big Can FUAs Get in the Future
Being able to predict how large a FUA can grow can go a long way in ensuring better planning
and more efficient investments. Of course the one thing we know with certainty about the future
is that it will be different. Still, working with a few simple assumptions, we can estimate at the level
of big order of magnitudes, the population these FUAs could achieve, based on the migrants they
will be able to attract (and obviously, based on the people they might lose to out-migration). With
respect to the population that could be convinced to migrate to one of the 41 FUAs, we estimated
that around 3 million people live outside the 41 FUAs and have a high likelihood to move at least once
during their life-time. They largely represent people aged 0-29 in 2011 (5-35, currently) not living in
one of the analyzed FUAs. Obviously, not all of these people will move to the FUAs – this is neither
realistic nor desirable. With respect to migration flows, we took into consideration the migration
intensities these FUAs have registered between 2001 and 2011.

Thus we take three large scenarios into consideration:

           1.	 Optimistic Scenario. The optimistic scenario assumes that all of the 0-29 year
                olds currently not living in one of the 41 FUAs analyzed here will move to the FUAs,
                and none will move abroad or to other areas in Romania. Moreover, it assumes that
                nobody already living in the FUAs will move out. If the population of Romania will not
                change, then the 41 FUAs will amass under this scenario 73% of the country’s population
                (currently, the 41 FUAs amass 58% of the country’s population).
           	
           2.	 Moderate Scenario. The Moderate Scenario is similar to the Optimistic Scenario,
                with one difference – it assumes that around 62.5% of the 0-29 year olds will not migrate
                to the 41 FUAs but will migrate abroad. This is the current proportion of migrants that
                chose to move abroad rather than moving within the country. Under this scenario, the
                41 FUAs would end up amassing 70% of the country’s population (in a situation where
                Romania’s population would drop to 18.1 million due to out-migration).
           	
           3.	 Pessimistic Scenario.           The Pessimistic Scenario is similar to the Moderate
                Scenario, with the difference that it considers that 13% of the population of the 41%
                FUAs would migrate abroad (this is the current national out-migration rate). In this
                scenario, the 41 FUAs would amass 68% of the national population (in a situation in
                which the Romanian population would drop to 16.6 million due to out-migration).

                      While the focus of this work is on the internal movement of people within Romania, it is
                      important to also discuss the external movement of people. Between 1990 and 2011, 1.8
                      million Romanians migrated to the 41 FUAs discussed here, but 3 million migrated outward.
                      The opportunities offered by more developed economies obviously are more attractive than the
                      opportunities offered by Romanian FUAs – maybe with the notable exception of Bucharest. Thus, it is
                      not surprising that Romanians have been much more willing to move abroad than within the country.

                      Capturing the exact magnitude of external migration is difficult to ascertain, given that
                      people that emigrate are not registered in any database when they move out. According to
                      the National Institute of Statistics (NIS), the phenomena of external migration was undercounted
                      both in the population estimations that are done yearly, and in the final results of the 2011 Census.
                      According to the 2011 Census, only 1.1 million Romanian live abroad, although EUROSTAT indicates
                      that around 3 million Romanians are living abroad.

                      This mismatch appears because a lot of emigrants, or their relatives, are not present to
                      provide inputs to the census surveyors. A decent estimate of the real magnitude of outmigration
                      can be however given if several data sources are correlated, namely: 1) the legal population of each
                      administrative unit (i.e. the number of citizens with fixed abode in the respective administrative
                      unit); 2) the citizens with permanent residence registered at the Census and included in the stable
                      population of each territorial unit. The difference between these two groups (including the short-term
                      migrants that are methodologically included in the stable population determined at the Census) is
                      represented by the citizens with permanent residence abroad, namely 2.7 million in 2011, almost
                      identical with the estimations of EUROSTAT. If the estimation at national level has a degree of
                      confidence of more than 95%, the one at county or locality level has a degree of confidence of 80%,
                      being influenced by underestimated internal migration flows (especially within functional urban
                      areas). This approach allows only a quantitative evaluation of migration, in terms of number, age
                      and gender – i.e. it provides only the big picture.

                      The qualitative assessment of the external migration (country, duration, gender, urban/
                      rural origin, occupation, economic status and sector, motivation etc.) is based on the only
                      available data originating from the 2011 Census. This data is based on approximately 400,000
                      (12.5% of the total number of Romanians living abroad) questionnaires filled-out by temporary
                      migrants. From a statistic point of view, this sample is representative, although we can assume that
                      there are some differences between short and long-term migrants that should be further explored.

98 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Romania is one of the EU Member States most affected by out-migration. EUROSTAT
estimates than around 3 mil. Romanians left the country after 1990, out of which 1.5 million only
after EU accession in 2007. This makes Romania the 6th largest emigration source in EU in absolute
figures, respectively the 1st in relative terms (i.e. percentage of the total population). The high out-
migration rate, coupled with a smaller immigration rate, has led to a negative external migration
balance, which currently represents the main source of labor force decline, and one of the main
sources of demographic decline. Around 500 inhabitants move from Romania to another country
every day, which makes out-migration one of the key challenges for policy makers.

The first massive outmigration flows were represented by German and Hungarian minorities
that moved to Germany and Hungary respectively. This ethnic outmigration wave was gradually
replaced, especially after the EU accession, by the outmigration of native Romanians in search
for better opportunities. Currently, Romania is the main source of immigrants for Spain, Italy and
Hungary (see map below).

                       Even at the regional and county level some external migration patterns can be observed.
                       People from the east of Romania are predominantly moving to Italy, while those in the center and
                       south of the country prefer Spain. Greece is a top destination for the people in the south of Romania,
                       while Germany and Hungary is a top destination for people in the west of the country, where these
                       two ethnic communities traditionally resided.

100 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
The final results of the 2011 Census show that 65% of all emigrants left the county for
at least one year. This pattern applies to most counties in the country, with the exception of
Dâmbovița, Harghita, Maramureș and Satu Mare – where short-term migrants prevail. Short-term
migrants are actually commuters that travel abroad to work especially in seasonal activities, such
as agriculture, tourism or constructions. Most of the short-term commuters come from rural areas
(65%), whereas the long-term migrants primarily come from urban areas (54%).

Over 46% of emigrants are aged 20-34, and only 16% are over 45. In 2011, over a third of
Romanian citizens aged 25-29 were living abroad. The figure is rather alarming and indicates that
policy makers need to do more to keep some of these people at home, and cities, particularly
secondary cities, hold the key. The more opportunities secondary cities will offer, and the better
quality of life people will be able to enjoy there, the more people they will be able to attract and keep.

                            The number of emigrants aged 0-14 is relatively low, and underscores a social issue that is
                            quite pressing in today’s Romania – the significant number of children left behind by one or both
                            parents working abroad. A significant number of Romanian children growing up in households with
                            migrant parents are raise up by grandparents, siblings, or other relatives. It is a dynamic which will
                            likely negatively affect these children’s development, and will most likely have a negative effect on
                            the future development of the country.

102 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
A look at the demographic structure of population and emigrants indicates an over-
representation, both in total numbers and numbers of emigrants, of people aged 20-44.
Interestingly, these people represent the „Decrețeilor” Generation – people that were born after
Ceaușescu’s 1966 Decree 770 that outlawed abortion. These people came of age after 1989, and
many did not manage to find opportunities at home. As such, the rate of out-migration among these
“decreței” is much larger than the number for the rest of the population – in part also because “the
decreței” outnumber both the generations born before 1966 and the generations born after 1989.

The areas most affected by external migration are the remote and densely populated ones,
lacking a large and dynamic urban center, such as the Subcarpathian Moldova (the counties
of Suceava, Neamț, Bacău, Vrancea), Satu-Mare, Maramureș, and Bistrița. These regions are
predominantly rural, with small and medium cities that do not have the economic capacity to absorb
the excedentary labor force resulted after abortion was outlawed through the Decree 770/1966. It is
important to note that these regions are peripheral both in the national and the EU context, being
clustered at the external border of both Romania and the EU.

External migration and underdevelopment do not necessarily go hand in hand. The team ran a
regression comparing the number of people that emigrated after 1990 with the level of development
of the sending locality7, and found a positive and significant (99% confidence level) correlation (see
Annex 3). In plain speak, this means that emigrants disproportionately hail from more developed
localities (e.g. larger urban centers), although in relative terms they primarily leave poor rural areas.
For a lot of people living in poor rural areas, commuting and internal migration were not attractive
enough, because of poor urbanization, distance from opportunities, and poor transport infrastructure.
External migration was for many of the people living in those areas the simplest path to a better life.

                          Another interesting dynamic is the importance of dynamic urban centers in limiting out-
                          migration. Thus, as the map above clearly shows, the large area around Bucharest is constituted
                          by localities with a relatively low (less than 6%) out-migration rate. This indicates that the capital
                          provides enough of a draw, to dissuade some of the people around it to move abroad. Other
                          dynamic functional urban areas, such as Cluj-Napoca, Ploiești, Oradea, or Pitești, also have a lower
                          outmigration rate.

                          In terms of gender, 51.3% of migrants were male. The poor job offer in sectors that traditionally
                          employ male workers, such as heavy industry, transport, agriculture or constructions lead to higher
                          migration rates among this group. The female workforce has been more mobile internally (57% of
                          internal migrants are female), being more adept at filling the growing number of service jobs created
                          by the new economy.

                          In terms of motivation, 70.6% of the migrants went abroad in search of a job, 15.6% for
                          personal reasons and only 1.9% for studies. Better paid jobs are the main motivation Romanians
                          move to other countries, with the exception of the Republic of Moldova, Canada and some Arab
                          countries, where most migrants move for personal reasons (e.g. marriage). Student primarily prefer
                          Italy, UK, Spain, Hungary and France, while tourists Asia and Africa.

                          Only 7% of emigrants hold a bachelor degree, compared with over 14% of the stable population
                          in Romania, while 52% have graduated only lower secondary education. Although we have to keep
                          in mind the sample is made only of short-term migrants, that usually activate abroad in seasonal
                          activities (agriculture, tourism, construction) we can assume that the education attainment level of
                          most Romanian migrants is below average, since the unemployment rate among people with tertiary
                          education remains low. However, some patterns can be noticed when analyzing the distribution of
                          migrants by country: the share of migrants with tertiary education is much higher among those who
                          choose US, Canada or the Scandinavian countries (over 20%), well-developed countries with a more
                          selective immigration policy, and decreases to less than 10% in the case of Spain, Italy, Portugal or
                          Greece, in search for seasonal workers with basic education.

71.9% of Romanian emigrants have an occupation, compared to less than 50% of the total
population residing in the country. However, only 67.9% are registered as employees, while the
rest are either freelancers or unpaid family workers. 57% of Romanian migrants are employed as
qualified workers, 37% as elementary workers, and only 5% are white-collar workers (managers,
professionals and technicians). Emigrants to US and Canada are disproportionately white-collar
workers and students, while an overwhelming share of people emigrating to the EU are blue-collar
workers. Only 5% of the Romanian immigrants work in KIS (Knowledge Intensive Services) sectors,
most of them in Italy, Germany, Spain, the UK, and Hungary.

With respect to the targeted economic activity, 44% of the Romanian emigrants are
working in the services sector (especially trade, tourism, transport, housekeeping, cleaning),
27% in construction, 20% in agriculture and only 9% in industry. Most of the emigrants working in
Italy, Spain, Germany, Hungary, Austria, US and UK are employed in services sectors, while those
choosing France and Belgium primarily work in constructions. The largest share of emigrants working
in agriculture and industry was reported in Portugal, Denmark and Spain (30-35%), respectively
Slovakia and the Czech Republic (25-35%).

                       The data analyzed so far, indicates that people in Romania migrate for three main reasons:
                       personal reasons (e.g. marriage), job, or studies. Thus, the FUAs with the most people (e.g. you
                       are likely to find more marriage partners in larger places), the most job openings, and the most
                       places for students, are also likely to attract the most people. Similarly, people chose to move to a
                       different city for a better quality of life, to move up in the world (often people migrate from smaller
                       towns to bigger cities), or to take advantage of business development opportunities. In addition, a
                       number of enabling factors (e.g. proximity to large markets, average housing/land prices, the quality
                       of the local administration, tolerance of people in the destination city) also play a role in a person’s
                       decision to move somewhere.

                       Clearly, the FUAs that offer the best combination of a large population, plenty of jobs, a lot
                       of spots for students, and good quality of life, are also the places most likely to attract a lot
                       of people. We have therefore decided to test this hypothesis and identify the FUAs that are most
                       likely, from a statistical point of view, to attract people. This would allow us to identify the cities
                       in Romania that over-perform or under-perform when it comes to in-migration. Annex 2 includes
                       a more detailed analysis of all independent variables considered for this analysis, the methodology
                       that was employed to identified the most significant variables, and the steps taken to identify the
                       individual weights of each independent variable.

                       The independent variables that seem to impact internal migration most include:

                           1.	   The total stable population (weight: 23%);
                           2.	   The number of students (weight: 21%);
                           3.	   The average monthly wage (Euro) (weight: 21%);
                           4.	   Firm revenues per capita (weight: 20%);
                           5.	   Investments per capita (weight: 6%);
                           6.	   Distance from Bucharest (weight: 9%).

                       These weights were then used with a simple rank method to identify the FUAs in Romania,
                       outside Bucharest, that are statistically most attractive for migrants:

The table below compares the ranking of the 40 FUAs on the Index of Magnetism to their ranking on actual
migration between 1991 and 2011. The FUAs that significantly underperform may manage to attract migrants
in higher numbers if the proper policies are put into place. For example, the City of Arad scores high on the Index of
Magnetism, but does less well in terms of actual in-migration. Encouraging more dynamic land and housing markets
may bring more people to the area, given that economically the FUA is doing quite well.

110 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
 WHERE do PEOPLE
ACTUALLY WANT to
     MOVE




           The INDEX of MAGNETISM I   111
                In the previous chapters we have seen where people in Romania have moved in the past, and
                we developed an index that shows which are the most attractive places in Romania now.
                In this chapter, we will discuss the results of a survey where we asked people where they
                are thinking of moving in the future. The survey was submitted to a representative sample of
                1,250 people in Romania, using a “random route” sampling method that took into consideration the
                territorial distribution of the population, the demographic make-up, as well as the distribution by
                sex and by urban and rural areas.

                The first question we asked in the survey was: “Do you intend to move from the locality
                where you currently live within the next 5 years, and how likely are you to move?”. 18%
                of respondents (representative for around 3.6 million people) indicated that they intend to move
                within the next 5 years, with an average certainty rate of 85%. 82% indicated that they have not
                considered moving within the next 5 years. Of those that consider moving, a disproportionate share
                are young people – the average age for the people that consider moving is 35 years. 75% of the
                people considering a move within the next 5 years do not have children, and of the 25% that do have
                a child, the majority only have one child. By-and-large, people that consider moving have a higher
                educational attainment, have higher incomes, and are to a larger degree employed in the private
                sector than the country average. Territorially, people in less developed regions (e.g. South-Muntenia,
                North East) are more likely to move than people in more developed regions (e.g. West, Center).

                When asked where they would like to move, 66.5% of respondents indicated they would
                prefer to move within Romania, while 31.3% indicated they would prefer to move outside
                the country. Thus, the results indicate that around 2.4 million Romanians are considering moving
                within the country in the next 5 years, while 1.1 million are considering emigration – a switch from
                the dynamic in previous years, when a majority of Romanians preferred to move abroad. From a
                territorial perspective, people in the West of Romania are to a larger extent considering a move
                abroad, whereas the people living close to Bucharest are more likely to move within the country.
                Urban residents and people with higher education are more prone to out-migration, while people
                with lower education attainment and rural residents are more likely to move within the country. Men
                prefer emigration, while women prefer in-country migration.

                When asked where in Romania they would like to move, 71.4% of respondents indicated a
                preference for urban areas. The people that are considering moving to an urban area within the
                next 5 years are representative for around 1.7 million people in Romania. Territorially, people from
                regions with a higher urbanization rate (e.g. Center) have a higher likelihood of moving to an urban
                area. From a demographic point of view, young people, and people with higher education tend to
                disproportionately prefer urban areas to rural areas.

live in if they would have the option to move to any of those cities. 32.6% indicated they would
like to stay in the city where they currently live; 27% would like to live in a city from a different region;
10.7% would like to live in a city within their county; 8.5% would like to live in a city within their region;
21.2% did no provide an answer. Territorially, the regions with the most attractive urban centers are
Center, West, North West, and Bucharest-Ilfov. The regions with the least attractive urban centers
include South-Muntenia, North-East, South-West, and South-East.

The table below shows the cities people in Romania would most like to live in. A total of 77 cities
were named by respondents, but only county residences were included in the table, to ensure consistency
with the rest of the analysis in this report. The most attractive cities are Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca,
Timișoara, and Brașov. In particular, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Brașov, have a disproportionate
share of people wanting to live there – i.e. the share of people that would like to live in these cities is
much higher than the share of their FUA population in the national population. For example, the FUA
of Cluj-Napoca amasses 2.34% of the country’s population, but 11.37% of survey respondents would like
to live there. High scores were also registered for Constanța, Sibiu, Iași, or Oradea.

                   When asked about the reason for picking a particular city, a vast majority chose “quality of
                   life” as a main motivation. This underscores again the need for investment in urban infrastructure,
                   and the need for a concerted effort to make cities more attractive and appealing to people. The
                   second reason people chose particular cities was “jobs”. As is the case in most countries, access
                   to jobs is an important magnet for migrants. The third reason, people chose particular cities was
                   specialized healthcare. In a context of demographic decline and aging, easy access to healthcare
                   facilities is of particular importance. As a fourth reason, people indicated a different option than
                   the ones provided (job; quality of life; education; healthcare). The most cited reasons are listed in
                   the figure below. For example, several people chose Brașov because it’s a “beautiful city”, and several
                   people chose Constanța for „family, friends, or acquaintances”.

From a territorial point of view, people generally prefer cities that are close to them. The cities
that have managed to attract the largest number of migrants between 2001 and 2011 (Bucharest,
Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, Constanța) were also chosen by the survey respondents from all over
Romania – i.e. they have a relatively large migration catchment area. Interestingly, cities that are
favored tourist destinations (e.g. Brașov, Sibiu) also ranked quite high in the preference of survey
respondents. For example, survey respondents from 30 different counties chose Brașov as a preferred
city to live in.

This data also enables a rough estimate of the people local administrations could, potentially,
expect to receive in coming years. Thus, we know that around 1.7 million people in Romania are
considering moving to an urban area within the country, different from the locality they currently
reside in, within the next 5 years. We also know, which cities people would prefer if they were to
move. If we put the two together, we get a rough picture of the absolute number of people interested
in moving to Bucharest or one of the county capitals in the proximate future (see table below, with
the 15 most favored urban locations).

       CAN
 SECONDARY CITIES
     SUSTAIN
REGIONAL GROWTH?




                    117
                         One of the key policy questions this report has tried to answer is whether secondary cities
                         can sustain regional growth. Every piece of evidence we have collected to this end seems to indicate
                         that indeed, without strong cities, regions cannot have a strong economy. Moreover, it seems that
                         secondary cities play a particularly important role in the performance of both regional and national
                         economies. As was discussed earlier, in all EU countries, regardless of the performance of the primate
                         city (with high performers, such as Bucharest, Bratislava, Paris, Brussels, or Amsterdam), national
                         economies seem to very closely resemble the performance of their secondary cities. In essence,
                         national economies seem to be only as strong as the economies of secondary cities. And, the more
                         performant secondary cities are, the better off the national economy is likely to be.

                         Secondary cities are also critical for regional economies. In Romania, the economy of all
                         seven regions outside Bucharest-Ilfov are dominated by the largest FUAs. Regardless of the level
                         of development of these regions, from lagging to leading, it is a handful of FUAs that generate an
                         overwhelming share of economic output. This seems to indicate that without strong FUAs, one
                         cannot have strong regions.

                         The summary table below gives a clear and telling picture of the importance of secondary
                         cities for regional economies. The growth poles (Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Craiova, Iași,
                         Ploiești, and Timișoara) have a share in the regional economic output that is usually double their share
                         in the regional population – indicating that they are the economic growth engines for these regions.
                         There seems to be a clear premium to size, with the largest urban centers in every region being also
                         the most productive – generating between 24% and 47% of firm revenues in their respective region.

There are of course a number of FUAs that are underperforming – particularly the smaller
ones. For example, Reșița, Sfântu Gheorghe, Miercurea Ciuc, Focșani, Călărași, Giurgiu, Drobeta
Turnu Severin, or Brăila, have shares in the regional economic output of the region that are lower
than their share in regional population. Generally, the bigger the FUA, the more productive it tends
to be. Which, again, is a strong argument for demographic and economic concentration.

The strengthening of functional urban areas is of particular importance for lagging regions.
In this case, “lagging regions” were defined using the methodology of the European Commission – i.e.
low income regions with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below 50% of the EU average. It is important to
note here that when the European Commission first presented the methodology for identifying low-
income lagging regions, the South-East Region in Romania was identified as a low-income region.
                                                                       CAN SECONDARY CITIES SUSTAIN REGIONAL GROWTH? I 119
                        The GDP data for 2014 was made available in the mean-time, and the South-East Region passed
                        the 50% threshold. By 2017, when this report was finalized, it is likely that also the North-West
                        Region managed to achieve the same feat. The least developed regions in Romania (North East,
                        South West, and South) have one thing in common: as opposed to the other regions, a majority of
                        their population lives outside the existent FUAs. More specifically, the population of these regions is
                        predominantly rural or living in small towns. Without strong FUAs, it will be very difficult for these
                        regions to perform well. Particularly for the North-East Region, which has dense rural areas, the
                        strengthening of urban areas will be of paramount importance in the coming years.

                        Evidence also indicates that people that move to FUAs also achieve a higher standard of living.
                        The table below gives a vivid picture in this respect. For one, it shows that FUAs have a growing
                        share in the population of their respective regions – i.e. people prefer the main FUAs to other places
                        in the region. Also, virtually all of the FUAs, with the exception of Miercurea Ciuc, have registered a
                        Local Human Development Index8 above the regional one – i.e. people that moved to these FUAs also
                        moved to a higher standard of living. It has to be noted here though, that between 2001 and 2011,
                        all regions, and all county capital FUAs, with the exception of the Cluj-Napoca FUA, have registered
                        population decline – primarily due to outmigration and low fertility rates. However, on average,
                        regional FUAs have decreased slower than the regions themselves.

Not all FUAs have performed equally strong though. By-and-large, the larger FUAs have
performed better than smaller FUAs – which again indicates that there is a clear premium to size.
Thus, all the seven regional growth poles have registered a growing share in the regional population,
albeit generally a small increase, and all of them had a Local Human Development Index (LHDI) that
was well above the regional mean – from 10.5 additional points in Constanța to 21.1 in Iași.



                                                                 CAN SECONDARY CITIES SUSTAIN REGIONAL GROWTH? I 121
                Overall, smaller FUAs have had shrinking shares in the regional population. Their relatively
                poorer performance is likely due to outmigration, as well as migration to the larger FUAs. Some of
                the FUAs, such as Vaslui, Focșani, Tulcea, Brăila, Miercurea Ciuc, Piatra Neamț, or Zalău, have lost
                more than 15% of their population between 2001 and 2011 – a dramatic drop, often double the
                regional average drop.

                At the same time, smaller FUAs have in several cases a high Local Human Development
                Index, despite a drop in population and relatively poor economic performance. Thus, all of
                the FUAs in the North East Region, the poorest region in Romania, have an LHDI that is at least 10
                points above the regional average. Târgu Jiu and Drobeta-Turnu Severin in the South West Region
                also perform quite well. The same is the case for Brăila, Galați, or Târgoviște in their respective
                regions. Although these FUAs are not top economic performers, they offer people living there a
                standard of living that is well above the regional mean.

                In addition to providing a higher standard for the people moving there, FUAs have also raise
                the standard of living for the people living in surrounding localities – i.e. the benefits have
                spilled over to surrounding areas. Figure 11, earlier in the report, nicely shows this spill-over effect.
                Virtually all localities around a dynamic city have benefited from being around that dynamic city.
                By-and-large, the least developed localities in Romania are those that are some distance away from
                a large urban center, with the most remote localities being also the lest developed.

                How close does a locality need to be to a city to benefit from positive development spill-
                overs from that city. This is a question of critical importance for regional development specialists,
                and a question without a clear answer. We have tried to test different hypotheses regarding the
                positive, or potentially negative impact, of dynamic cities on the region as a whole.

                What is quite clear is that regions without strong cities, do not have strong economies.
                However, strong and dynamic cities do not all have the same effect on the regions they
                are part of. Figure 11, shows, for example, that cities like Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Iași directly
                benefit an immediate territory that is much smaller than the territory influenced by cities such as
                Timișoara, Arad, Brașov, or Sibiu. This difference can partly be explained by the economic make-
                up of these cities. Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca and Iași are large university centers with strong service
                economies (e.g. IT, consulting, medicine, academia). As such, they have a higher share of jobs in
                high value-added sectors, which pay salaries that can offset the higher cost of living in those cities,
                and they attract people from further distances. Timișoara, Arad, Brașov, and Sibiu are important
                industrial hubs, with a lot of new investments undertaken in suburban and peri-urban areas. Salaries
                in manufacturing usually grow slower than the salaries in the services sector, and many people
                prefer commuting to work from surrounding localities, rather than migrating to the urban center.

                The hotspot map below shows this dynamic quite nicely. Thus, the areas with the most positive
                population dynamic between 2002 and 2011 are usually situated around a dynamic urban center.
                However, service centers like Cluj-Napoca and Iași have benefited a smaller immediate area than
                industrial hubs like Brașov or Timișoara. Annex 4 shows that the level of development of the localities
                surrounding Cluj-Napoca and Iași drops quite soon – beyond 10 km of the city center. In the case
                of Timișoara, there is a significant drop in the level of development of surrounding localities only
                beyond 25 km, while in the case of Brașov this inflexion point is as far out as 50 km. Figure 78 helps
                explain this dynamic.

                Basically, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca and Iași are high value-added service hubs that have
                attracted qualified people from other urban areas within the country or within their
                respective regions. There are clear benefits to clusterization in high value-added sectors. Usually
                the larger number of people that work in a high value-added sector, the higher productivity they
                can achieve, and the higher the salaries that are offered in these clusters. As such, there is a clear
                premium for highly specialized people to move to existent clusters in their area of expertize.

122 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Manufacturing hubs, like Brașov or Pitești, on the other hand, attract people from the
immediate surroundings. Usually people commute for manufacturing jobs, they don’t move to
them. One could say that manufacturing hubs benefit territories, while service hubs benefit people.
Both types of hubs play a critical role in the development of their respective regions and countries,
but they do so in different ways. Service hubs lead in innovation and economic growth, making
people more productive by clustering them together, while manufacturing hubs make the people
already living in the surrounding territories more productive. Both dynamics are important for
regional development.

When we look at where development levels have grown the fastest, we see another interesting
dynamic. First and foremost, we see a very fast growth in the areas surrounding dynamic cities
in lagging regions. The growth hotspots are largely clustered in the North East, South West, and
South Regions – Romania’s least developed regions. Moreover, the hotspots are clustered around
significant urban hubs in those regions – e.g. Iași, Bacău, and Botoșani in the North East Region;
Craiova and Râmnicu Vâlcea in the South West Region; and, Bucharest-Ilfov in the South Region.
Another important dynamic is the significant improvement in development outcomes around the
country’s most important service hubs – Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Iași.

                       Interestingly, growth has been the slowest (i.e. the cold spots) in the most urbanized region
                       – the Center Region. The Center Region is not only the most urban in the country, but also among
                       the most developed. As such, most of the localities in this region have a higher level of development
                       then the rest of the country, and as such, their convergence rate has been slower. The relatively
                       poorer localities in the North East, South West, and South Regions have started their transition
                       from a lower development level and have converged at a faster pace between 2002 and 2011.

                       We can thus conclude that FUAs play a critical role for regional development, although they
                       play this role differently. Manufacturing hubs seem to have a wider territorial impact on the area
                       around them, while service hubs concentrate (through in-migration) specialized work-force within a
                       core urban area. As such, in the short- and medium-term, manufacturing hubs are likely to have more
                       positive regional benefits than service hubs. But, over the long-term, it is service hubs that will likely
                       drive regional and national growth.

                       While an overwhelming amount of evidence indicates that FUAs are critical for a country’s
                       growth and development, few countries have elaborated clear urban development strategies/
                       policies – Romania makes no exception. The National Territorial Development Strategy for
                       Romania has been finalized in 2015 and it clearly delineates the importance of urban areas in
                       driving national growth and development. However, as of the writing of this report, the strategy
                       had yet to be approved by the Parliament. At no point in its history did Romania have an urban
                       development strategy/policy, recognizing the importance of cities in the development of the country,
                       and the government offers little targeted assistance to cities and metropolitan areas (e.g. investment
                       programs that encourage metropolitan development).

                   The largest sub-national investment program, the PNDL (the National Local Development
                   Program) has virtually no allocations for urban investments. In 2017, a multi-annual PNDL
                   budget of 30 billion RON (around 6.6 billion Euro) was approved, and these funds are primarily
                   destined to rural areas.

                   In the past years, urban authorities had to largely depend on their own funds and on EU funds
                   for critical capital expenditures. The table below provides an overview of capital expenditures
                   between 2007 and 2015 for Bucharest, the 40 county capitals, and their FUAs. The interesting thing
                   is that while county capitals have managed to attract 32% of EU funds absorbed by local public
                   administrations, they only spent 18% of total local public capital expenditures. This reflects both the
                   budget equalization process (with poorer localities getting extra funds to enable their functioning), and
                   a disproportionately larger allocation of funds form the state-budget for investments in rural localities.

Also interesting to note is the fact that if EU expenditures are taken out, capital expenditures
are higher in peri-urban areas than in core cities. The FUA localities located outside the 40 county
capitals, were responsible for 19% of total local public capital expenditures, as opposed to 18% of
expenditures in the county capitals. Basically, this means that the FUA localities outside Romania’s
core cities spent more on capital expenditures then the core cities of the FUAs. This is in itself not
a bad thing, given the significant needs of peri-urban areas. However, most of these investments
have been done in a piece-meal fashion, resolving individual problems of these localities, rather than
solving metropolitan issues. The metropolitan level represents currently both an administrative and
investment gap in Romania, which has not yet been properly filled.

There is also evidence that the large and dynamic cities underspend while smaller cities
and rural areas overspend. The World Bank has developed a simple tool (the operational budget)
for the Romanian Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, which enables public
authorities to prepare multi-annual investment programs. The tool starts from the premise that
public authorities have almost limitless needs, but limited resources. Thus, proper prioritization of
needs is paramount. And, the first step in a prioritization process is identifying how much money can
the public authority realistically allocate to fulfilling those needs. The operational budget does just
that. It looks at budget expenditures over the past five years, takes an average value for those years,
and projects it over a program implementation period. The non-earmarked revenues are isolated for
the particular implementation period, and 30% is taken out of these non-earmarked revenues – this
is the operational budget for that particular public authority. The basic premise of this tool is that
                                                                       HAVE FUAs in ROMANIA RECEIVED the PROPER SUPPORT? I 127
                  every capital expenditure a public authority undertakes, will most likely also require operation and
                  maintenance costs further down the road. And, if capital expenditures are undertaken at an un-
                  sustainable pace, the public authority risks wasting valuable resources. For example, a local authority
                  that modernizes its street network but is unable to maintain these roads, will sooner or later be in
                  the same position where it was when it first modernized these roads. The operational budget (i.e.
                  30% of non-earmarked revenues) gives public authorities as simple way of determining how much
                  they should allocate for capital expenditures over a certain time-period. It is not an exact tool, but it
                  can let public authorities know that they are either under-spending or over-spending.

                  The table below indicates that over 2007 and 2015, the localities in the outter FUAs of
                  Bucharest and the 40 county capitals, and the smaller cities, have overspent, while the most
                  dynamic urban centers (Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Constanța) have underspent.
                  Of course, the overspending or underspending is a matter of finesse – it depends on how large an
                  economy is, and also on how big the difference is to the operational budget. A small variation from
                  the operational budget for a large economy (e.g. Arad, Sibiu) is an indication of relatively sound
                  budgetary planning for that particular public authority, whereas a large variation (e.g. Bucharest,
                  Iași, outter Cluj FUA) indicates relatively poor budgetary planning. Strong FUAs require adequate
                  investments in dynamic core cities, proper investments in metropolitan infrastructure (e.g. transport

                Knowing what the strength and weaknesses of cities are, is the first step in devising better
                policies for enabling regional growth and development – particularly in lagging regions.
                Cities are regional and national growth engines, and they will continue to play this role in the future.
                However, in order for the Romanian economy to compete head to head with established economies
                in the West, its secondary cities have to first compete head to head with secondary cities in the
                West. It is these secondary cities where the battle for a strong Romanian economy will be fought.

                To catalyze the growth and development of secondary cities, it is not enough to rely solely
                on market forces – one also needs strategic public sector interventions. For example, good
                connective infrastructure is critical in ensuring better access to markets, better mobility for people,
                and a better allocation of resources where they are most needed. Often, the most needed connective
                infrastructure projects cannot be completed by local authorities on their own. Investment in quality
                of life (more and better parks, pedestrian areas and bike paths, good public transport systems,
                culture, art, entertainment) can make cities more attractive to people and investors, and thus more
                competitive. Similarly, better integrated planning at the metropolitan level can make a functional
                urban zone more attractive for investors and people, by unlocking available land for construction and
                by better connecting the region.

                The analysis above, and the statistical and GIS analysis in Annex 1, 2, and 3 clearly show
                that secondary cities in Romania require assistance from different administrative levels.
                For example, Annex 3 indicates that there is a very powerful correlation between the growth of
                the labor force and the growth in the number of people that commute across administrative
                boundaries. This is a very powerful message as it indicates that economic growth in Romanian cities
                is intimately linked to an increase in commuter numbers. More specifically, urban economic growth
                is inherently metropolitan economic growth. For local administrations, this reinforces a key message:
                urban development planning is ultimately metropolitan development planning. More specifically, if
                you are a mayor and you want your city to do well, you need to have a mechanism to coordinate
                and plan with the localities around you. In Romania, this is utterly absent – no urban center has
                managed to develop, on its own, metropolitan infrastructure in the past 27 years, although almost
                every large FUA now has commuter numbers that would actually warrant the development of
                metropolitan expressways. Transport norms in Romania indicate that it is advisable to upgrade a
                road to highway when you have over 15,000 cars passing daily on it. 23 of the FUAs analyzed here
                receive over 15,000 daily commuters (in addition to the daily transit traffic). Moreover, as the map
                below indicates, despite a general demographic and urban decline, functional urban areas have been
                sprawling aggressively in the past years, and are continuing to do so.

Universities, and a strong education sector in general, also play a vital role in the vibrancy
and dynamism of a city. Inevitably, the top performing FUAs in Romania are university towns. These
universities also play a critical role in strengthening the local business environment, as they provide
to local firms and potential investors a constant supply of educated and well-qualified people. Where
a strong university is missing (obviously, not every town can be a university town), it is nonetheless
important to properly link private sector to the education sector, to ensure the adequate labor force
is delivered to firms.

Demography is also important. Larger FUAs have by and large a stronger gravitational pool than
smaller cities. These FUAs primarily attract young people (people of 0 to 29 years have been most
mobile in Romania), and their capacity to sustain growth over the long-term is inevitably linked to
the size of their gravitational fields and the number of young people living in this gravitational field.
Obviously, the smaller the gravitational field of a FUA, and the smaller the number of people living
in this gravitational field, the bleaker are the future growth prospects for the FUA. The correlation
analysis indicates that the localities with a higher share of people aged 40 and above, are more likely
to have a lower development level (and a less mobile population). FUAs with an aged population will
need to identify targeted solutions to demographic decline and aging, as this will likely be the most
important challenge they will have to deal with.

Lastly, quality of life will become increasingly important for the FUAs fighting to attract
the best and the brightest from within Romania, and, increasingly, from abroad. Quality of
life is something that is hard to quantify and difficult to capture in hard numbers. Although there is


                                                                              IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 133
                        an increasing number of studies that show how good places can improve community satisfaction9,
                        policy makers don’t put a high premium on this measure. Although they themselves prefer to spend
                        their vacation in beautiful places (the places with the highest number of tourists are those with
                        abundant cultural and historical heritage), and although they prefer to spend their free time in well-
                        designed spaces (a well designed park attracts more people than a wild forest), they do not always
                        invest in providing a better quality of life for their residents. Owners of bars and restaurants know
                        that a good interior design is critical to attracting more customers, but mayors are often blind to
                        this reality. Interestingly, the survey we have done to assess where people would like to live, indicates
                        that quality of life is a key factor when deciding to move to a different place.




Implications for EU Policy
                        In the absence of a stand-alone national urban development policy, it is EU policy that
                        has guided urban development in Romania in the past years. If one travels from city to city,
                        it becomes immediately obvious that the most ambitious projects of the past years are those
                        that have been financed from EU funds. Local development strategies in Romania are most often
                        adjusted to include projects that are eligible for EU funding. This in essence requires EU policy to
                        better respond to the needs of Romanian cities, and ensure that a “one-size-fits-all approach” (for
                        all EU cities) is avoided.

                        The Europe 2020 Strategy has a clear focus on smart, sustainable, and inclusive development,
                        and it sets a number of clear targets for all Member Countries. The EU-wide 2020 targets are
                        as follows: 1) Employment -> 75% of people aged 20-64 to be in work; 2) Research and Development
                        (R&D) -> 3% of the EU’s GDP to be invested in R&D; 3) Climate Change and energy -> a) greenhouse
                        gas emissions 20% lower than 1990 levels; b) 20% of energy coming from renewables; c) 20% increase
                        in energy efficiency; 4) Education -> a) rates of early school leavers below 10%; b) at least 40% of
                        people aged 30-34 having completed higher education; 5) Poverty and social exclusion -> at least
                        20 million fewer people in – or at risk of – poverty/social exclusion. These targets were adjusted
                        for individual Member Countries, to better respond to realities on the ground. Thus, the targets for
                        Romania, for the 2014-2020 Programming Period are as follows: 1) Employment -> 70% of people
                        aged 20-64 to be in work; 2) Research and Development (R&D) -> 2% of the EU’s GDP to be invested
                        in R&D; 3) Climate Change and energy -> a) greenhouse gas emissions 20% lower than 1990 levels;
                        b) 24% of energy coming from renewables; c) 19% increase in energy efficiency; 4) Education -> a)
                        rates of early school leavers below 11.3%; b) at least 26.7% of people aged 30-34 having completed
                        higher education; 5) Poverty and social exclusion -> at least 580.000 fewer people in – or at risk of
                        – poverty/social exclusion. These targets acknowledge, for example, that educational attainment is
                        much lower in Romania than in other EU countries, while the share of energy coming from renewables
                        is higher in Romania than the EU average.

                        Although the Europe 2020 targets are adjusted to fit realities in individual Member Countries,
                        individual funding programs introduce some rigidities. For example, the European Regional
                        Development Fund (ERDF) 2014-2020 requires that a large share of funds allocated for regional
                        development focus on one of the following “thematic concentration”: 1) innovation and research; 2)
                        the digital agenda; 3) support for SMEs; 4) the low-carbon economy. The mandated ERDF shares are
                        as follows: 80% for more developed regions (in the case of Romania, this applies to the Bucharest-
                        Ilfov Region); 60% in transition regions; 50% in less developed regions (all regions in Romania outside
                        Bucharest-Ilfov). Romanian authorities have chosen to focus much of the ERDF funding for “low-
                        carbon economy” activities, although the country performs relatively well on this indicator.

134 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Ideally, as the evidence in this report highlights, a larger share of EU funds should focus on
encouraging sustainable urban and metropolitan development – particularly in low-income
regions with a small urbanization rate. Without strong cities, one cannot have strong regions.
For the 2014-2020 Programming Period, EU countries had to allocate at least 5% of their ERDF
allocation for Sustainable Urban Development activities. In the view of the team elaborating this
report, this mandated allocation is not enough. Given that primate and secondary cities generate
50%-70% of the GDP in most EU countries, it is important to allocate a more substantial share of
funds to urban and metropolitan development.

For the 2007-2013 and the 2014-2020 programming periods, the EU funds that have been
allocated specifically for urban areas in Romania, and the funds that urban authorities
could access, have been relatively limited. For the 2007-2013 Programming Period, only around
6% of EU Funds targeted urban areas specifically, and another 19% represented funds that urban
authorities could access. For the 2014-2020 Programming Period, the allocation to urban areas
increased significantly (to around 14%), but it is still far from where is should be. Moreover, only
around 4% of total EU funds are allocated for integrated urban development programs.

We recommend that a larger share of future ERDF funds be allocated to integrated
sustainable urban development activities. The reasons for this are manifold. In the EU, primate
and secondary cities amass 23% of the population and generate 63% of the GDP. They are absolutely
essential for strong national and regional performance. Moreover, when we look at how EU funds
at the subnational level have been spent in Romania in the 2007-2013 Programming Period, we see
that 32.3% have been absorbed by secondary cities. Mind you though, that this is not a share of
ERDF funds, but rather a share of EU funds absorbed by local government (i.e. municipalities, towns,
and communes). If funds are guaranteed to cities or metropolitan areas (for example, through an
Integrated Territorial Investment instrument), and if the accessing of these EU funds is mandated
on having a clear strategy and clear list of priorities, there is a higher chance of having these funds
address key urban and metropolitan development challenges in Member Countries.

A stronger focus on secondary cities is particularly important for New EU Member Countries.
In New Member Countries, secondary cities have to be strengthened to compete on equal footing
with their Western counterparts (the same way primate cities have managed to do in recent years).
Without strong secondary cities, it will be difficult to have strong regions, and without strong
cities, lagging regions cannot improve their performance. This in essence also raises the question of
increased decentralization and the provision of the proper levers and tools for local leaders.

In what follows we will discuss a number of key aspects to be taken into consideration for the 2021-
2027 Programming Period.


                                                                                  IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 135
                Large Infrastructure
                Many of the necessary interventions at the metropolitan level are outside the means
                of local authorities, or they require very burdensome transaction costs. For example, all
                investments in national roads can only be undertaken by the central government – county councils
                are responsible for county roads, and local authorities are in charge of local roads. Similarly, the
                financing of infrastructure projects across administrative boundaries requires the collaboration of
                different public authorities, and even when public authorities agree on the project to be undertaken,
                there are limitations imposed by the convoluted legal system. Even metropolitan public transport
                systems are hard to implement because of the legislative vacuum, although 23% of employed people
                in the FUAs commute across administrative boundaries. Inter-jurisdictional projects often require
                that the wealthier center city provides financial assistance to the less wealthy surrounding localities.
                This is almost impossible to do in Romania.

                Currently, the Operational Programme Large Infrastructure 2014-2020 and the National
                Transport Masterplan provide many of the major interventions required in the Bucharest FUA,
                but are somewhat silent on the major interventions required in other large urban areas. While
                the Transport Masterplan was being elaborated, all the growth poles were elaborating in parallel mobility
                plans for their functional urban zones. These mobility plans include critical interventions required for
                a better functioning of these FUAs. Several of the required interventions (e.g. bypasses, large bridges,
                modernization of commuter rail lines) are outside the jurisdiction or the means of local administrations,
                and they should be considered as priority interventions for the next programming period.

                For the 2021-2027 Programming Period, it will be important to have a dedicated Operational
                Programme funding line for major metropolitan infrastructure projects. Projects that could be
                financed under this funding line include:

                        a)	 The rehabilitation/modernization/construction of roads that improve
                            connectivity within metropolitan areas. Investments could include: the development
                            of new ring roads; the development of new connective roads between peri-urban localities
                            and the center city; the modernization of existing roads (e.g. addition of an extra
                            lane and/or the addition of bicycle infrastructure); the development/modernization/
                            rehabilitation of bridges to improve connectivity; the development of road infrastructure
                            that could sustainably guide the future expansion of the metropolitan areas.

                        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: Bucharest, regional magnets, cross-county magnets]


                        b)	 The rehabilitation/modernization of commuter rail lines and the acquisition
                            of commuter trains. In most developed countries, a significant share of commuter
                            trips is done by commuter trains. Investments in metropolitan rail infrastructure does
                            not only enable the population in the larger functional urban area to be more mobile,
                            but it also guides development in a sustainable way, by encouraging higher density
                            developments around the main rail hubs. Obviously, commuter trains don’t make sense
                            everywhere. The map below indicates the population within a one-hour rail-access to
                            Bucharest and the 7 regional growth poles – i.e. the people that could immediately benefit
                            from improved rail connections. The FUAs where investments in commuter rail would
                            make most sense include Bucharest, Timișoara, Ploiești, and Constanța. Also, it would
                            make sense to develop high-speed rail for the Brașov-Ploiești-Bucharest-Constanța axis.
                            The rail on this corridor was modernized in recent years, but high-speed trains cannot
                            yet operate on this route.

          c)	 The modernization of airport infrastructure to enable faster and easier air
              commuting and cargo transport. More and more people commute between large
               urban centers by plane. The growth in air traffic in Romania, is among the highest in
               the EU. The table below shows that passenger numbers have been growing at a break-
               neck speed for the largest airports in Romania. Budget airlines now make it easy and
               convenient to travel between urban centers at very low costs (one can fly from Bucharest
               to Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, and Iași for around 10 Euros). Airport infrastructure should
               therefore be modernized to make in-country commuting easier. While most airports have
               been modernized in recent years, nearly all of them are under-sized when compared
               with current traffic volumes. Airport infrastructure should therefore be continuously
               modernized and extended. Interventions could include: addition of runways to enable
               a higher frequency of planes; enlargement of passenger processing infrastructure (the
               busiest airport in Romania cannot cope with passenger inflows at peak travel times);
               development of intermodal infrastructure to enable seamless further travel in the
               destination metropolitan area, or beyond. In addition, airports should be modernized to
               allow easier cargo air shipments. Particularly for the urban centers that are further away
               from the developed markets in the West (Iași, Craiova, Constanța, Bacău, Suceava),
               such infrastructure is critical.

                          d)	 The environmental cleanup of brownfields and their preparation for future
                              investments. Such interventions are now eligible for financing under the Regional
                               Operational Programme, but most local authorities lack the expertise, willingness, and/
                               or financial means to undertake such interventions. Brownfields occupy large swaths of
                               land in most metropolitan areas in Romania, but because of an unclear legal framework,
                               and because of the lack of involvement of public authorities in this area, have largely
                               remained idle in the past year. Even in Bucharest there are significant plots of land in
                               the center city, with high real estate value, that have not seen any interventions on
                               them in the past 26 years. These brownfields could accommodate not only new housing
                               units, but also much needed office space and mixed-used developments – particularly
                               needed in the regional magnets.

                          e)	 The development of metropolitan business infrastructure. Of the 1.1 million
                               people that migrated to the FUAs of Bucharest and the 41 county capitals, 47% settled
                               in peri-urban areas of the FUA, outside the center city. A similar pattern is followed
                               by private investors, particularly manufacturing companies – more than 27% of firm
                               revenues for the FUAs of the 40 county capitals in Romania are generated outside the
                               core city. To be able to receive these investors, and to be able to more pro-actively attract
                               high value-added investors, it is critical to have the proper business infrastructure,
                               where companies could easily settle. Unfortunately, the localities where such business
                               infrastructure should be located, and the county councils themselves, cannot afford
                               to finance such infrastructure, and it is important for them to receive assistance.
                               Investments in business infrastructure are usually done by private companies, or, most
                               frequently, by county councils. However, county councils generally have limited budgetary
                               resources to their disposal, and a wide array of responsibilities they cover (e.g. county
                               roads, solid waste management, social assistance, health). The table below indicates the
                               estimated operational budget (i.e. how much can be allocated for capital expenditures) for
                               the 2014-2023 Implementation Period. In most cases (with the exception of Hunedoara,
                               Teleorman, Vaslui, and Harghita), county councils have significantly less funds to their
                               disposal than county residences. Given however that often new business infrastructure
                               has to be developed outside the administrative limits of county residences, it is important

                to also have national resources or EU funds that could be access for such a purpose.
                Obviously, to avoid building “cathedrals in the desert”, it is important that financing for
                such business infrastructure be made available only when a strong business case is made.

                                                                             IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 139
                Local Infrastructure
                The Regional Operational Programme finances a number of local investments that should be
                continued, but it should add a number of other investment types to its portfolio. In particular,
                for the 2021-2027 Programming Period, the Regional Operational Programme (or, potentially,
                regional operational programmes) should focus more on investments that raise the quality of life
                in Romanian cities and make them more attractive for migrants, including return migrants from
                abroad, and expats. The survey undertaken by the Bank team at the national level, indicates that
                quality of life is one of the key factors in people’s decision to move to a city. Key interventions that
                could be considered include:

                        a)	 Rehabilitation/modernization/creation of public spaces. Public spaces, such as
                            plazas, squares, meeting points, is what many people use to define quality of life, and
                            often a decision to move to a place is taken based on how attractive urban spaces are.
                            It is critical to make as many public spaces as possible more attractive for people, and
                            interventions can include: closure of public spaces to car use and making them more
                            accessible for pedestrians; introduction of greenery; rehabilitation of building facades in
                            and around public spaces; introduction of urban and street art elements.

                        b)	 Rehabilitation of historic buildings and of buildings located in central areas.
                            The buildings in the city, are the city’s face to the World, and the better they look, the
                            more attractive the city becomes for people, investors, and tourists.

                        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


                        c)	 Rehabilitation/modernization of apartment block neighborhoods and the
                            public spaces in and around the apartment blocks. In 1989, around 85% of the
                            built stock in Romania was developed during Communism. Much of this built stock was
                            of low quality and requires proper maintenance and upgrading. Significant EU funds
                            are now available for the thermal rehabilitation of apartment blocks, but no EU funds
                            are available for the spaces around the apartment blocks. Potential interventions for
                            the 2021-2027 Programming Period could include: improvement of green spaces in
                            apartment block neighborhoods; creation of recreational infrastructure (e.g. playgrounds,
                            training equipment, spaces for retired people, sports infrastructure); rehabilitation/
                            modernization of pedestrian infrastructure and development of neighborhood level bike
                            infrastructure.

                        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


                        d)	 Creation/modernization/rehabilitation of green spaces. There are numerous
                            studies that show that green spaces can improve the overall well-being of people, and
                            such investments should be encouraged whenever possible. Moreover, good quality green
                            spaces should be protected from real estate interests. Where deemed necessary (e.g. no
                            green spaces available), existent brownfields could be converted into new green spaces.
                            Potential interventions could include: planting of trees and greenery along urban streets;
                            rehabilitation/modernization of existing parks; development of new green areas; better
                            pedestrian and bike access to existent green areas; green parking lots; introduction of
                            green spaces on the top of apartment blocks with flat roofs. Ideally, no city in Europe
                            should have streets without at least a speck of green.

        e)	 Extension/modernization/rehabilitation of pedestrian and bike infrastructure.
            The easier it is to get around town in a sustainable way, the more people will choose
            to do it. Such investments are financed generously for the 2014-2020 Programming
            Period, and they should be continued for the next programming period.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


        f)	 Extension/modernization/rehabilitation of metropolitan public transport
            infrastructure. Good public transport infrastructure is critical for each dynamic urban
            area. It is a priority for local authorities in most developed countries, and it should be a
            priority for local administrations in Romania.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: Bucharest, regional magnets, cross-county magnets]

        g)	 Targeted interventions for urban marginalized communities. No economy can
            hope to have a long life, if social cleavages are widening. Consequently, EU funds should
            continue to be offered for addressing the challenges faced by marginalized communities.
            The most successful cities will attract a wide range of migrants, and among them there will
            also be considerable numbers of poor and marginalized people. The better local authorities
            are able to deal with these marginalized groups, the better prepared they will be for future
            swells. Immigration is one of the main challenges faced by developed countries and cities,
            and it is a challenge Romanian cities will also likely deal with in the future.

Human Capital
An economy is the sum of its people, and it cannot grow sustainably if it cannot rely on a
large enough pool of human capital. It is tough to properly target human capital investments, as
every individual has different needs. There are however certain things that can help cities strengthen
the human capital they have and certain things that can help them be more attractive to human
capital. Some key interventions include:

        a)	 On-the-job training programs. Not every city can be a university center of excellence.
            At the same time human capital does not necessarily require university training. Most
            of the people that have generated disruptive innovations, do not have a university
            degree. Often, the skills required to innovate are generated on the job. As such, it is
            important to have programs (including EU funded ones) that allow local companies to do
            on-the-job training to interns and new recruits. This can allow them both to offer higher
            entry salaries, and to spend more time and attention to critical training programs. The
            programs should primarily target high value-added companies that can sustain long-
            term growth. Well trained people can attract investors, and investors attract other
            people – it is a virtuous circle that vocational education and on-the-job training or work-
            based learning programs can achieve.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


        b)	 Scholarships for university students. As good as the universities in Romania are,
            they can hardly compete with the universities in the developed world – there is no
            university in Romania that is in the Top 500 Shanghai University Ranking. This means
            that it is important for students from Romanian universities to be exposed to professors,
            other students, teaching methods, and the last technical/academic advances from top-
            notch global universities. EU funds have financed such scholarships in the past, and
            they will play an important role in strengthening the Romanian education system in
                                                             IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 141
                           the future. Such programs will be particularly important for Bucharest, the regional
                           magnets, and the cross-county magnets.

                       [The FUAs this measure most applies to: Bucharest, regional magnets, cross-county magnets]


                       c)	 Internships programs. Internship programs play a critical role in matching students
                           with potential jobs, once they finish school. Internship programs should target not only
                           local companies, but also international ones. The local job offer often does not cover the
                           entire spectrum of needs, wants, and desires.

                       d)	 Twinning programs for professors, private companies, and NGOs. It is
                           professors, private companies, and NGOs that are best equipped to spread knowledge
                           and ideas to a larger group of people, and they have to learn from those that are better
                           than them how to advance in their field of activity.

                       [The FUAs this measure most applies to: Bucharest, regional magnets, cross-county magnets]


                       e)	 Translation of critical works in distinct fields, which are not profitable enough
                           to translate for private publishing companies. The West generates an amount of
                           knowledge that is very hard to absorb by developing countries. Usually there are curators
                           of knowledge that know what are the pieces of work that deserve a wider national and
                           local audience (e.g. guides for urban development), and they should be offered the means
                           to translate and publish works that are particularly useful and needed in the society.

                       f)	 Open knowledge repositories. Cities and metropolitan areas in Romania are routinely
                           faced with challenges they have no clear solutions for. Some local authorities are more
                           astute than others in finding the proper solutions, but these solutions remain local and
                           don’t find their way to other local authorities. Moreover, local authorities in other EU
                           countries may have perfected the same solutions over decades. These solutions (e.g.
                           templates for terms of reference, pieces of local legislation; tax incentive systems; land
                           redevelopment mechanisms) could be made available in an open knowledge repository,
                           to enable as many stakeholders as possible to access them.

                       g)	 Extension of the number of courses/classes offered in English. English is the
                           business and academic lingua franca of the World. If you don’t speak English, you risk
                           being cut off from the main knowledge flows in the World. It is therefore important
                           to expand the offering of course/classes in English that help people not only deepen
                           their knowledge of English, but also acquire the technical language in a field they are
                           interested in.



                Competitiveness
                Competitive cities require competitive companies and competitive individuals. Conversely,
                competitive companies require competitive individuals, and vice versa. Some measures that could
                be undertaken include:

                       a)	 Access to internet infrastructure for everybody. Internet is increasingly recognized
                           as a public good, and all citizens should be offered easy access to internet. In areas where
                           internet is not offered, public authorities should strive to provide the service. Moreover,
                           free WiFi should ideally be offered in as many public spaces as possible – preferably all
142 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
               (this may also work to make these public spaces more attractive). The internet is one of
               the most powerful tools created by humanity, as it offers individuals from all over the
               World access to a vast library of knowledge. Those that have access to the internet also
               have the basic tools for becoming autodidacts.
         	
         b)	 Revolving fund for start-ups and SMEs. Start-ups and SMEs rarely are the economic
               engine of an economy, although they often are the main employers. It is usually large
               and super-productive companies that sustain economic growth. However, start-ups and
               SMEs provide the seeds for potential endogenous technological growth – i.e. they may
               create the innovations that can launch a city on an accelerated growth path. Moreover,
               homegrown companies are much more stable than multi-national corporation, and
               much more likely to stick around during times of economic hardship. For these startups
               and companies to be able to play the role of innovator, it is important for them to have
               easy access to financing.
         	
         c)	 Incubators for start-ups. Start-ups have a difficult time in their early years, and they
               lack the experience and resources required to overcome the first business incubation
               years. Public authorities can provide incubator spaces, which allow startups to go easier
               through their early years.

Implications for National Policy
Romania has never had a clear urban development policy. While better data and recent evidence
indicates that functional urban areas are critical for the country’s good economic performance,
relatively little attention has been paid to this subject. As the figure below highlights, the FUAs of
Bucharest and the 40 county capitals generate over 90% of all firm revenues in Romania, amass
80% of the population with higher education, attract 65% of in-country migrants, and are the places
where 63% of new housing developments were completed after 1990. However, the allocation of
resources to urban areas, particularly to secondary cities and functional urban areas, has
not been proportional to needs, or even proportional to these cities’/FUAs’ population.

                   For a country its size, Romania has relatively weak secondary cities. As the map below
                   indicates, with the exception of Bucharest-Ilfov, Romania has no other “predominantly urban region”
                   (i.e. large metropolitan area). Evidence from all over the EU indicates that it is these “predominantly
                   urban regions” that are responsible for an overwhelming share of the EU economic output. Without
                   policies, investments, and interventions that encourage the development of strong urban areas, it
                   will be difficult for Romania to sustain long-term growth. Currently, around 43% of the EU population
                   lives in “predominantly urban regions”, while only 11.3% do so in Romania.

                   The accession to the EU, and the access to EU funds, have more or less obliged Romanian
                   national authorities to think more about cities and regions. And it is EU funds and policies
                   that have triggered the most dramatic changes and interventions at the urban level. The Romania
                   Government should ideally complement EU-level resources and policies, and develop an endogenous
                   and coherent assistance package for urban areas. This has to be coupled with the continued
                   decentralization of administrative responsibilities, but doing this in a strategic way, with a strategic
                   allocation of responsibilities, tools, and levers based on what the local administrations can actually
                   handle. Many people predict that “mayors will rule the world”, and Romania should also take bold
                   steps towards this future

                   In what follows, we will discuss a few ideas on how the central government could help FUAs become
                   more competitive, and more attractive to migrants and commuters.




144 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
National Urban Development Strategy
Romania has a strong National Territorial Development Strategy, but it has no clear Urban
Development Strategy. The National Territorial Development Strategy envisions a polycentric
Romania, with strong secondary cities, and lower rank urban areas. It acknowledges the importance
of cities in driving national growth and development, and proposes a number of large scale
interventions (e.g. large infrastructure projects, metropolitan development) that could help Romanian
cities become more competitive. There is however no clear policy/strategy targeting urban areas,
and responding to their concrete needs.

Obviously, a national policy that promotes some areas over others is a difficult political
sell. Promoting migration from rural areas to urban areas, because of the positive socio-economic
outcomes, will likely be challenged by many. However, an urban development policy should not be
conceived in opposition to a rural development strategy. Rather, they should be seen as complementary.
Rural areas will be unable to perform well without strong urban areas; and, urban areas require the
proper territorial integration of rural areas for sustainable expansion and development. It’s difficult
to have one without the other. The experience of virtually all developed countries indicates that it is
almost impossible to sustain economic growth and development without strong cities, and without
properly linking rural areas and smaller towns to these strong cities.

A proper urban development strategy could help identify the FUAs with the best promise
of sustaining regional/national growth, and it could identify concrete measure the central
government could take to help thee FUAs fulfill that role. Such an urban development strategy
would be not only the foundation for the allocation of EU funds to urban areas, but could also
provide the foundation for a state-budget funded investment program targeting urban areas.




National Metropolitan Investment Program
Romania does not have a state-budget investment program, or funding line, targeting urban
areas. The largest sub-national investment program, the National Local Development Program
(PNDL), primarily targets small-scale infrastructure in rural areas. Rural areas are unfortunately
seen not as parts of larger socio-economic and territorial systems, but rather as “islands” that
have to be rescued from going under. The fear is that without quality infrastructure in rural areas,
people will move out and leave these rural areas empty. While this is a valid fear, it is important
to understand that no amount of quality infrastructure will keep people in rural areas if they have
difficult access to jobs, quality education, specialized healthcare facilities, or proper entertainment
opportunities. In most cases, rural areas that are not well connected to a strong urban area, will find
it difficult to thrive. It is therefore paramount to integrate rural areas in larger socio-economic and
territorial systems, and metropolitan planning and development become key in this respect.

This report has identified the functional urban areas for Bucharest and the 40 county
capitals. It employed a uniform OECD-EC methodology that was also used under the Regional
Operational Programme 2014-2020, to define the FUAs for the 39 county residences that are
eligible for pre-allocated sustainable urban development funds. This methodology could be expanded
to determine the FUAs for the other urban centers in Romania. Once all these FUAs have been
identified, it will be easier to devise policies and interventions that cater to the needs of these areas.
Inevitably, FUAs incorporate a large rural territory, which has to be properly integrated in the FUA
and properly connected to opportunities within the FUA and beyond. The map below shows quite
clearly that few localities exist and function in a vacuum – the large majority are part of smaller or
larger territorial systems. The more integrated and inter-connected these systems are, the better the
outcomes for the people living there.

                         Provided that urban/metropolitan development is seen as a priority by the government,
                         several options could be considered for devising a metropolitan development program:

                                    a)	 Stand-alone investment program. Depending on estimated investment needs
                                          for metropolitan areas, and depending on resources local authorities can rely on, an
                                          independent Metropolitan Development Program with state-budget funding could be
                                          created. Preparations for the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 have put
                                          county residences in a good position, as they had to prepare Urban Mobility Plans and
                                          Integrated Urban Development Strategies, with concrete lists of priority projects. The
                                          World Bank has also provided assistance to the Ministry of Regional Development
                                          and Public Administration with the estimation of operational budgets (i.e. financially
                                          sustainable allocations for capital expenditures) for the 2014-2023 Implementation
                                          Period. We have computed the operational budgets for the FUAs of Bucharest and the
                                          40 county capitals (core cities and outter FUAs). The total operational budget for these
                                          FUAs was estimated at around €15.3 billion. Of this sum, around €6.6 billion is just
                                          the operational budget for the Bucharest FUA. In essence, the operational budget looks
                                          at budget executions and estimates how much a public administration could allocate
                                          for capital expenditures, over a given time-period, in a financially sustainable way (i.e.
                                          ensuring that future operation and maintenance costs for the new investments can be
                                          ensured). This total sum, gives an idea of how big an integrated investment program
                                          in metropolitan areas should be. Thus, if only the FUAs of the 40 county capitals are
                                          considered, the investment program would have a total value of around €8.8 billion.
                                          Obviously, most of the needed investments in these FUAs would be undertaken by
                                          the local public administrations themselves, but the central government could bring a
                                          significant contribution to covering existent needs in those areas.

                areas could also be encouraged through one or more funding lines within an existent

                largest sub-national investment program in Romania, could have a dedicated funding
                lines for metropolitan infrastructure. Unfortunately, the program has received funding
                applications, primarily from rural localities, with a total value well in excess of the
                allocated multi-annual budget. This, in essence, means that there may live little money

                           An urban/metropolitan investment program, financed from the state-budget, could help
                           local authorities in Romania cover needs that they have been unable to cover on their own
                           in recent years. For example, few local authorities have managed to finance metropolitan projects
                           because of legal challenges in implementing projects across jurisdictional lines. Similarly, many of
                           the needed interventions require funds well in excess of what local authorities can afford. Some
                           interventions that could be considered include:

                                        a)	 Metropolitan road infrastructure. Virtually every major city in Romania requires
                                             additional access roads and connective infrastructure. All county capitals, as well as
                                             smaller cities, are now developing urban mobility plans, where they identify their key
                                             infrastructure needs. The table below indicates the county capitals with completed
                                             mobility plans, and highlights the ones that have new road construction planned. More
                                             often than not, local public administrations cannot afford to finance such infrastructure,
                                             or have difficulties in financing infrastructure that crosses administrative boundaries.
                                             In addition, such infrastructure is not eligible for financing from EU funds. Central
                                             authorities could therefore come to the rescue and provide financing/incentives for
                                             metropolitan roads, which would enable two or more local authorities to undertake a
                                             transport investment together.

           b)	 Metropolitan business infrastructure. Most new industrial facilities are nowadays
                built outside the administrative territory of core urban areas. The localities where these
                business facilities are located, usually cannot afford to pay for such infrastructure. It is
                therefore important to have funding from the national/regional level, with a focus on
                areas where a strong business case for such infrastructure is made.

           c)	 Public transport vehicles, and public transport infrastructure, servicing the
               metropolitan area (e.g. buses, trams, minibuses). There are few operational
                metropolitan transport systems in Romania right now, although commuter data
                indicates that such systems are needed in most large cities. Financing metropolitan
                public transport infrastructure (e.g. transit stops, park-and-ride facilities) and vehicles,
                could encourage more localities to develop such systems – for the benefit of all people
                living in the FUA.

           d)	 Rehabilitation/modernization/extension of district heating systems. District
                heating systems represent a sustainable way of providing heating and electricity (if
                co-generation systems are available) to a community. Unfortunately, such systems are
                expensive to maintain and operate, and most cities have had difficulties with them. In
                some cities (see table below), district heating systems have disappeared completely; in
                others they have shrunk considerably, being replaced by individual heating units; while
                in other cities they are maintained at a significant expense for the local authority, and
                usually require very high subsidies. Obviously, in places where maintaining a district
                heating system does not make economic sense anymore, one should not invest more.
                But in areas where such a system could be run efficiently, it is important to consider
                assistance from the central level.

150 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
            a)	 Urban regeneration of apartment block neighborhoods. An investment program
                of the Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism, targeting the thermal-insulation
                of apartment blocks, has subsequently triggered investments (from public, EU, and
                private sources) all over Romania. Thermal insulation investments are now financed
                by the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020, and in many cities investments
                are financed, to a large extent, from private sources. Similar to the thermal insulation
                program, the Government could provide financing for an urban regeneration program,
                which would focus not only on the apartment blocks themselves, but also on the interior
                and exterior communal spaces (e.g. green areas, playgrounds, parking lots, alleyways,
                bike paths).

            b)	 Rehabilitation of historic buildings and historic city centers. Many of the
                historic cities in Romania are relatively small and have small budgets. As such, they
                are often incapable of taking proper care of their historic and cultural heritage, and
                thus deprive themselves of potential tourism revenues, while also missing the chance of
                making themselves more attractive to people and firms. As the table below highlights,
                FUAs often have a higher concentration of architectural monuments in the outter FUA
                (e.g. Pitești, Ploiești, Râmnicu Vâlcea), usually located in localities with scarce budgetary
                resources. Even the most dynamic cities lack sufficient sources for taking care of their
                historic heritage. Moreover, the current legal framework and its enforcement leave much
                to be desired. Thus, architectural monuments that are in private property are often left
                to the elements by their owners, with no punitive measures imposed.

                            c)	 Housing development. A lack of access to affordable housing can hamper migration to
                                dynamic cities and price-out some people living in those cities. The Ministry of Regional
                                Development, Public Administration, and European Funds finances a number of housing
                                development programs (from social housing, to housing for the Roma, or housing for
                                young people), but these programs are haphazard, sporadic, and not always strategic.
                                The World Bank has provided a number of recommendations for the development of a
                                unitary housing development program, which could respond to clear needs in Romanian
                                FUAs. It is also important to note that 52% of investments in new housing units in the
                                FUAs of the 40 county residences, have been done in outter FUA areas, not in the core
                                city. More often than not, the localities in these outter FUAs lack the budgetary means
                                for investments in housing, and national assistance is often necessary – particularly
                                housing for less wealthy people.

            d)	 Rehabilitation of public spaces. Quality of life is identified as one of the key factors
                that draws people to cities, and the better quality of life cities offer, the more attractive
                they are to people. Investments in the rehabilitation of public spaces, the extension/
                rehabilitation/modernization of parks and green spaces, the development of pedestrian
                and bike paths, go a long way in making cities more attractive. Many of the cities
                in Romania lack the necessary resources to raise the quality of life as fast as some
                migrants would require.

            e)	 Creation of metropolitan parks. The majority of urban areas in Romania have a
                significant dearth of properly maintained green spaces. EU indicates that every urban
                center should provide its citizens with at least 26 square meters of green space per
                capita. As the table below indicates, most of the large cities in Romania fall below this
                limit. Ensuring that as many people as possible will have access to green areas will require
                in many cases the development of parks at the metropolitan level – particularly in cases
                where the core cities lack reserves of land that could be converted to green areas.

                    National Legislative Framework
                    Two key laws guide urban and metropolitan development in Romania – Law 215/2001 on
                    Local Public Administration and Law 350/2001 on Spatial Planning. Law 215/2001 indicates
                    that the sub-national administrative divisions in Romania are the following: 1) counties; 2) localities,
                    which are of three types: communes, towns, municipalities (see map below). The Municipality of
                    Bucharest and its six sectors have a special status, with divided responsibilities between Bucharest
                    City Hall and the six sector city halls.

                    Unfortunately, Law 215/2001 does not take into consideration recent development
                    dynamics. Although much of urban growth has happened in rural areas around larger urban centers,
                    these areas continue to be considered rural and are treated as such in national and regional policies.
                    The image below provides an extreme example in this sense. The Commune of Florești, is basically
                    a suburb of Cluj-Napoca, and the largest rural locality in Romania (estimated to now house around
                    40,000 people). For all intents and purposes, Florești keeps being treated as a rural area by national
                    policy. In addition to Florești, there are several other suburbs that continue to be defined as rural,
                    although they are de facto suburbs. Thus, there are 25 communes in Romania with a population
                    above 10,000. As a point of comparison, 134 of legally defined towns (out of a total of 217) have a
                    population of less than 10,000. 399 communes have a population larger than 5,000, in a context
                    where 29 towns have less than 5,000 people.

Metropolitan areas are here, and they are here to stay – if their development is not guided
now in a sustainable way, there is risk of permanent damage for years to come. Unfortunately,
much of the damage has already been done. To ensure a better planning and development of
metropolitan areas, the Romanian legislation should recognize metropolitan areas and provide the
proper governance mechanisms for a more sustainable development of these areas. Several options
exist in this respect:

         a)	 Administrative merger. While not exactly easy to digest politically, administrative
              mergers have been used in the past in Romania, to expand the administrative territory
              of an urban center that has grown to reach surrounding villages. Mergers also make
              sense from an economic point of view. An OECD report10 shows that there is a clear
              downside to administrative fragmentation in metropolitan areas, with a direct impact
              on area productivity.
         	
         b)	 Metropolitan governance. Several countries have introduced another administrative
              level – the metropolis. For example, in Turkey, mayors are elected for the metropolitan
              area and for the constituent municipalities, and responsibilities are shared between
              the metropolitan government (büyükşehir) and the lower municipalities (belediyesi) –
              similar to how it is actually done in the case of Bucharest. For example, the metropolitan
              government may be in charge of the large boulevards, which are serviced by public
              transport, while the constituent municipalities are in charge of the smaller side-
              streets. Metropolitan governments are, however, not always a straight forward affair,
              with frequent confusion on where the responsibility of one administrative entity ends
              and the responsibility of another one begins. A simple solution would be to allocate
              the responsibility for the management of well-defined metropolitan infrastructure
              (e.g. metropolitan roads, metropolitan public transport, business infrastructure) to the

                                administration of the core city, while the smaller municipalities would be mainly in
                                charge of small local infrastructure (e.g. communal roads, educational facilities, cultural
                                centers).
                            	
                            c)	 Inter-communal development associations. The Romanian legislation, mimicking
                                the French legislation, allows individual localities to form inter-communal development
                                associations (IDAs) to jointly address common needs and challenges. Thus, IDAs have
                                been successfully set up all over the country to better manage water and waste-water
                                provision, the delivery of solid waste management services, or the implementation
                                of EU-funded strategies. There are currently 13 established metropolitan IDAs, which
                                have joined forces in the Romanian Federation of Metropolitan Areas and Urban
                                Agglomerations (FZMAUR). In some cases, such as Constanța, these metropolitan IDAs
                                have managed to implement projects at the metropolitan level. In practice however
                                metropolitan projects have proven difficult to implement – both because of a lacunary
                                legislative framework, and because of the reticence of local administrations to make
                                these IDAs truly operational. Following a push from the EU, several localities in Romania
                                are now in the process of setting up metropolitan public transport companies, following
                                the example of metropolitan areas where such systems are already operational (e.g.
                                Oradea and Alba Iulia).
                            	
                            d)	 Administrative agreements. To lower transaction costs and the administrative
                                burden, local administrations can also enter simple administrative agreements to
                                deliver certain projects in partnership. For example, two adjacent localities can agree
                                to build together a road that services and benefits them both. Such agreements are
                                easy to enter into, but difficult to operationalize. Building a road together would require
                                the two (or more) administrations to coordinate the financing and elaboration of the
                                feasibility study and the technical project, the tendering of the works, the attribution of
                                the projects, and the actual implementation. Such a level of coordination, along all those
                                steps, is hard to achieve in practice.

                The existence of metropolitan governance system is a key pre-condition for sound
                metropolitan planning. It does not help that the core city of a metropolitan area has a sound
                spatial planning system, if the localities around it don’t. Strict rules and norms can be rendered
                meaningless, if they don’t also apply across administrative boundaries. In either case, many county
                residences have outdated spatial plans – a situation that could be turned into an opportunity given
                the possibility of elaborating the spatial plan at the metropolitan level.

In this respect, it is critical to have proper metropolitan spatial planning. A metropolitan
spatial plan ensures that urban areas develops in a sound and sustainable way. Unfortunately, many
cities in Romania have not yet managed to update their old spatial plans, let alone prepare such
plans for the metropolitan level. Baia Mare and Brăila are among the few cities that have developed
metropolitan spatial plans. The negative effects of poor or no metropolitan spatial planning can be
gleamed in many poorly planned metropolitan areas around the Developed World. The image below
provides an example from the US, where the City of New Orleans, although it blends fully with the
neighboring Chalmette parish, it has a completely de-synchronized street grid. In effect, there are only
two major thoroughfares connecting the two communities – the secondary street grid stops basically
at the administrative border dividing the two communities. Without proper metropolitan spatial
planning, urban areas in Romania risk following a similar pattern, with wide negative repercussions
– e.g. congestion, inefficient public transport, pollution. “Streets are forever”, the saying goes, and if
they are not properly planned from the get-go, they risk being ill-planned forever.

                Unless metropolitan planning and development becomes a national priority, it will be difficult
                to convince local administrations to make it a priority. The relatively limitless array of needs
                cities have, represents a barrier to thinking on a grander scale. Mayors often have a myopic focus
                on the territory they manage, although they are well aware that their locality does not function in
                a vacuum. Thus, unless the Central Government provides incentives for metropolitan planning and
                development, few localities will purposefully choose to do this on their own. Consequently, the Central
                Government could finance, fully or partially, metropolitan spatial plans for the largest cities in
                Romania, while also providing finance for the development of metropolitan infrastructure identified
                in these spatial plans. This will create the preconditions for sustainable development.


                National Standards and Tools
                Another way in which the central government can help localities become more attractive
                is through the provision of standards and tools that help guide local authorities. Most
                local authorities, for example, lack experience in elaborating proper terms of reference for urban
                development works. The quality of urban infrastructure developed throughout Romania is a testimony
                to this. As such, it would be important to have proper standards and guides, which would enable
                local authorities to request a basic level of quality from developers. Some of the things that could
                be considered include:

                        a)	 Standards for urban roads. The Ministry of Regional Development, Public
                            Administration, and European Funds, already provides cost standards for county
                            roads and communal roads. It would make sense to have similar standards, or guiding
                            elements, which would help local authorities identify the minimum requirements they
                            should require from developers (e.g. the type and thickness of bitumen, the type and
                            thickness of the asphalt base, the type of crushed stones to be used for different types
                            of soil).
                        	
                        b)	 Standards for the thermal insulation of apartment blocks. The Government’s
                            thermal insulation program has been one of the most successful public investment
                            programs after 1989. It has not only provided a solution to a problem that remained
                            un-addressed for 20 years (the poor energy efficiency of Communist apartment blocks
                            and the decaying aspect of these buildings), but it also triggered similar investments
                            done from private funds and from local government budgets. The Ministry of Regional
                            Development and Public Administration has elaborated a guide meant to help achieve
                            quality thermal insulation projects, but the guide is primarily used for projects financed
                            from public funds. Privately funded interventions don’t follow any clear guidelines, and
                            a larger attention is paid to cost than to quality. Moreover, only few cities (e.g. Oradea)
                            have elaborated chromatic guides for the repainting of apartment blocks in a coherent
                            and harmonious fashion.
                        	
                        c)	 Guides for sustainable transport infrastructure. The most attractive cities tend
                            to be cities designed for people – i.e. cities that are walkable, bikeable, and easy to
                            navigate. For the 2014-2020 Programming Period, cities in Romania will have access
                            to substantial EU funds dedicated for the development / extension / modernization of
                            sustainable transport infrastructure – particularly pedestrian and bike paths.
                        	
                        d)	 Guides for the rehabilitation / modernization / extension of public spaces.
                            Quality public spaces are an important factor in raising a city’s quality of life. Public
                            spaces are where people congregate, socialize, and exchange ideas. The more inviting
                            the public space the more people it will attract. Romanian cities already have a relatively
                            rich experience with public spaces that have been modernized and transformed into
                            people magnets – the Old City of Bucharest, Piața Muzeului in Cluj-Napoca, the Craiova
158 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
            Old City Center, the Iași Palas Park, or the Constanța Old City. A guide targeting
            improvements of public spaces could provide local authorities with key elements they
            should take into consideration when elaborating a terms of reference (e.g. identifying
            ways to stimulate pedestrian traffic, creating attractors that keep people in the area
            for longer, and providing amenities that attract investors).

        e)	 Guides for the regeneration of apartment block neighborhoods. Most people
            living in urban areas in Romania live in an apartment block neighborhood. More often
            than not, these neighborhoods play the role of dormitories. It is important to devise
            ways of rethinking these neighborhoods and transforming them in spaces that are used
            24/7. This would require a re-thinking of how these spaces are used by children, teens,
            young professionals, families, single-person households, and retired people. Different
            types of people have different needs, and they are likely to use the public spaces around
            them at different times of the day.




Implications for Local Policy
A famous book quips that “mayors will rule the world”, and the evidence presented in this
report indicates that there is truth to this saying. The question is: what can mayors do to
enable their cities to play a more strategic role? The simple answer is: a lot. While assistance
from the EU and the Central Government is key for Romanian cities, it is local administrations that
should lead the charge in making their cities more competitive and more attractive to people. To do
so, mayors should see their role going beyond mainly ensuring the provision of basic public services.
The local administrations that will undertake the most changes that people are looking for, may also
attract a higher share of people on the move – to the detriment of the cities that fail to do so. Below,
we will discuss a few recommendations that local administrations may take into consideration.


Strengthening the Private Sector
No amount of investment in public infrastructure will make a city competitive if it does not
also have a strong private sector. More often than not, a city with a strong and dynamic private
sector tends to also be a city with a good administration, a city with better and improving public
infrastructure, a city with a bustling culture and art scene, and a city with a good quality of life.
Unfortunately, when it comes to encouraging private sector development, local administrations are
more often than not at a loss for ideas. In what follows, we will discuss a few directions that could
be considered:

        a)	 Strategically targeting foreign investors. Romania has the advantage of having
            access to the largest market in the World, and this access has been a boon for the
            economy, and particularly for the most dynamic cities. Access to the EU market went
            hand in hand with a transformation of the Romanian economy to more closely resemble
            the EU economy – i.e. there has been a growth in three key sectors that dominate
            the EU economy: 1) transport (e.g. automobiles, auto parts, buses, trains, airplane
            components); 2) electronics (e.g. coffee machines, TVs, toasters, microwaves); 3)
            chemicals (e.g. detergents, cleaning liquids, fertilizers). This growth and transformation
            of the Romanian economy has been driven by foreign companies (primarily from the
            EU) that have invested in the country. Foreign companies are important for a developing
            economy for several key reasons: 1) they bring technological change with them; 2) they

                                                             IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 159
                           have an already developed distribution and logistics network; 3) they have long-standing
                           relations with clients and know the Western markets well. These are advantages that
                           are hard to overcome by local companies. Consequently, the quickest way to develop a
                           local nascent economy is to attract foreign investment. This has to be done however
                           in a strategic way – i.e. by focusing on companies with a high value-added, with high
                           productivity, and high salaries. Unfortunately, though, local administrations rarely play
                           an active and strategic role in promoting their area to high value-added investors. More
                           often than not, they are happy to welcome whoever comes through the door. Obviously,
                           an investment is better than no investment, but if local authorities would be more pro-
                           active in searching for, communicating with, and negotiating a move with potential
                           investors, they could also ensure better economic outcomes for the community they
                           represent. Often times, all that is needed in strategically attracting investors, is a
                           person that communicates well in English, and an involved and responsive mayor.

                       b)	 Responding to the needs of the local private sector. While attracting foreign
                           investors can help boost local economic growth, local administrations should not forget
                           about the companies already active locally. It is crucial in this respect to periodically
                           engage private sector representatives and determine ways of responding to their needs.
                           Often times, private companies are willing to donate time and money to make the
                           locality where they operate better (e.g. they could offer free IT solutions to the public
                           administration, provide funding for local charity events, or fund infrastructure that
                           benefits others), and all is needed is an administration that does not say no to these
                           efforts.

                       [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


                       c)	 Spatial planning and land information system. One has to view investment
                           decisions as a river running down a valley. The same way a river finds the easiest way to
                           the bountiful sea, similarly investor follow the path of least resistance to qualified labor
                           force and markets. If local administrations want to steer investors towards them, they
                           should remove as many barriers as possible to potential investments. And, one of the
                           most important factors in this respect is land and easy access to land. A city that has a
                           good and functioning spatial plan, which lets an investors know immediately which land
                           parcels are zoned for which use, may make it easier for that investor to take a positive
                           decision. If in addition the city has a good land information system, which enables an
                           investor to figure out quickly who owns the land, whether they are interested in selling
                           the land, and what the price of the land is, they may be closer to creating more jobs.

                       [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


                       d)	 Business infrastructure. Investments in business infrastructure are critical for a city
                           that wants to attract investors, but these should be done only after a careful business-
                           case is made. Virtually every city, even the smaller ones, can attract investors, but
                           before they develop business infrastructure, they first have to understand well what
                           they have to offer. A city with a burgeoning service sector and a dynamic university,
                           may require incubator space for new start-ups; a small town with few higher educated
                           people, may instead need to invest in an industrial platform. And, it is important that
                           the infrastructure alone is not enough – it is critical to have the people that will help fill
                           the available space up (i.e. a management team for the infrastructure).

160 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Improving Quality of Life
Quality of life seems to weigh more heavily in people’s decision to move to a city than the
availability of good jobs. This is a critical piece of information for mayors. Investments in quality
public spaces, rehabilitation of historic buildings, extension/modernization of pedestrian and bike
paths, or the urban regeneration of apartment block neighborhoods, become really important. Of
course, a beautiful city is not the only factor that goes in achieving good quality of life. It is people,
first and foremost, that make a city more attractive. We instinctively prefer places that are alive,
dynamic, and interesting, places where we can find plenty of people like us. As Eric Weiner noted,
“happiness is other people”. In what follows, we will discuss a series of interventions local authorities
could undertake to make their localities more attractive to people:

        a)	 Rehabilitation / modernization / extension of public spaces. If happiness is
             other people, local authorities should strive to create many places where people can
             meet and spend time with other people. Public spaces are the preferred venue in this
             respect. Luckily, there are already several cities in Romania that have invested in the
             rehabilitation of public spaces and have seen them come to life with new businesses
             and increased pedestrian traffic (good examples can be seen in Sibiu, Craiova, Oradea,
             Alba Iulia, Cluj-Napoca, Brașov, Iași, Constanța, Baia Mare, Bistrița, Slatina, Timișoara,
             Miercurea Ciuc, Suceava, or Târgu Mureș). They can serve as good examples for other
             cities interested in undertaking similar programs. Ideally, investments in public spaces
             within city centers, should be continued with investments in neighborhood public spaces.
             This way, people have a variety of things to do in various city locations.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


        b)	 Rehabilitation / modernization / extension of pedestrian and bike paths. For
             people to socialize and enjoy other people, they need to be able to easily interact with
             other people. This means that cities should be designed for people, not for cars. The
             more people spend in their cars going from place to place, the less time they spend
             interacting with other people. The easier and more pleasant it is to go from place to
             place by foot / bike, the more chances people have of interacting with other people.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


        c)	 Urban regeneration of apartment block neighborhoods. Many of the apartment
             block neighborhoods in Romanian cities are nothing more than dormitory neighborhoods.
             They were not designed for pleasure and comfort. It is therefore important for local
             authorities to determine ways in which these neighborhoods can be transformed in
             places where people also want to spend their free time. This means that different types
             of amenities should be provided for the different type of people living there (babies,
             youngsters, teenagers, singles, families, young professionals, retired people). Few local
             administrations in Romania have found good solution for the regeneration of apartment
             block neighborhoods.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


        d)	 Rehabilitation / extension of green spaces and parks. In “Happy City”, Charles
             Montgomery shows that investments in green spaces are among the most efficient
             ways of raising the quality of life in a city. Green spaces and parks have a clear and
             measurable positive effect on people. It is therefore important for local authorities to
             ensure that citizens have easy access to such spaces. For example, the local authorities
             in Stockholm (Sweden) strive to have as many of their citizens as possible within a
                                                              IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 161
                           5-minute walk from a green space or water area. Romanian local authorities should
                           strive to achieve a similar standard. At the very minimum, they should look to ensure
                           that every street in the city has at least a speck of green (i.e. a “No Street without
                           Greenery” program).

                       [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


                       e)	 Creating a mandatory façade improvement and upkeep policy. In most developed
                           countries, building owners have to maintain their facades and rehabilitate the building
                           exterior at regular intervals. The legislation in Romania enables local authorities to raise
                           property taxes by 500% for owners of historic buildings that do not properly maintain
                           these buildings. Normally, local administrations should make it mandatory that building
                           facades are rehabilitated at regular intervals. The legislation enables the enforcement of
                           punitive measures for the poor maintenance of historical patrimony buildings, and local
                           administrations can promote and enforce punitive measures for the poor maintenance
                           of all buildings. The reasoning for such measures goes beyond esthetic considerations.
                           There are also clear economic considerations. A poorly maintained building can lower the
                           property value for other buildings around it, and as such can lower the city’s tax income.

                       f)	 Encouraging cultural and artistic events. A city without culture could be considered
                           a city without soul. Not every city can hope to be a cultural Mecca, but it is within the
                           purview of most local administration to ensure that cultural activities are periodically
                           organized. For many people, the availability of such cultural events is a key factor in the
                           decision to move to a city. Several cities in Romania (e.g. Alba Iulia, Arad, Bacău, Baia
                           Mare, Brăila, Brașov, Botoșani, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Craiova, Iași, Sfântu Gheorghe,
                           Suceava, Târgu Mureș, or Timișoara) have prepared cultural development strategies in
                           their bid to become European Capital of Culture in 2021. Timișoara ultimately won this
                           contest, but all local administrations that have prepared such strategies can implement
                           them, even though they haven’t actually won.

                       g)	 Addressing parking issues. Up to a certain threshold, economic growth and car
                           ownership growth go hand in hand. Romanian cities make no exception here. Car
                           ownership and car use have gone up exponentially, but the places where these cars
                           can be parked have remained relatively stable. Moreover, with more and more people
                           choosing suburban and peri-urban areas as a place to live, commuting has also gone up
                           significantly. It is therefore important for local authorities to identify ways of creating
                           more parking spaces, while at the same time ensuring that illegal parking is properly
                           addressed. Moreover, as Donald Shoup argues in “The High Cost of Free Parking”, parking
                           should not be seen as a free amenity. A parking spot occupies the equivalent surface
                           of a small apartment. A small apartment fetches a certain revenue, and so should the
                           parking spot – because it is real estate that is not used for other purposes. For example,
                           a summer terrace on that spot could generate tax revenues for the city.

162 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Fostering Partnerships
No man is an island, and no city is a self-sustaining enclave. As was discussed in this report,
there is a clear premium to size. Large cities are by-and-large more productive than smaller cities
because they benefit from economies of scale and scope. Large cities also offer people a series of
amenities that smaller cities can’t offer, such as: a larger number of jobs and a larger variety of jobs;
better connectivity to the outside world (e.g. airports, high-cadence trains, highway connections); a
greater variety of cultural and entertainment opportunities; higher education; specialized healthcare,
etc. No other city in Romania can offer the type of amenities that Bucharest offers. Large cities
basically create their own success. To be able to compete on a better footing, smaller cities are obliged
to form partnerships. Some of the partnerships that local administrations could consider include:

        a)	 Partnerships with other public administrations. It is one thing if a local
            administration promotes itself as a city of 300,000, and another thing if it promotes
            itself as a conurbation of 600,000, or a functional urban zone of 1,000,000. Size
            matters, and partnerships with other local administrations can bring multiple benefits.
            Urban areas with higher demographic mass tend to be more attractive both to firms
            and to people. Similarly, partnerships can help fill expertise gaps. For example, one local
            administration may provide advice to the partner administration on how to prepare
            terms of reference for an urban regeneration program. In the same vein, if smaller
            cities make partnerships with larger cities, they can benefit from some of the assets
            of the larger cities. Thus, the smaller city could promote its attraction in the airport
            of the larger city; the university in the larger city could come recruit students in the
            high-schools form the smaller city; the two cities could promote and subsidize public
            transport links that serve both their communities. Such partnerships can be done
            with different types of public institutions. Local administrations can, and often do,
            form partnerships with the county council. They can have partnerships with the local
            universities, to make cities more attractive to students. They can have partnerships
            with public land-owners (e.g. the Army), to unlock unused or under-used land reserves
            for strategic urban development.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


        b)	 Partnerships with the private sector. Companies are not pure profit-driven machines.
            They often have a social mandate, and are willing to allocate money, time, and energy
            to make the community where they operate a better place to live. Private companies, for
            example, could sponsor or organize social, cultural, and artistic events; they can develop
            and or/maintain public spaces (e.g. green areas, roundabouts, pedestrian areas next to
            their buildings); they can develop new infrastructure that benefits all (e.g. a road that
            can cut commuting times); they can teach courses at schools and universities, to better
            prepare children for future jobs. Companies in the FUAs of Bucharest and the 40 county
            capitals have generated revenues of around 228 billion Euro in 2015 – not a negligible
            sum. At least part of this revenue could contribute to making the community where the
            company is located better, and smart partnerships can unlock these capital flows.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]


        c)	 Partnerships with civil society. A city is only as strong as its citizens, and the more
            a local administration knows how to capitalize on the strength of the community living
            there, the better off the city will be. People don’t adhere to strictly assigned roles – they
            can play, and often want to play multiple roles. People can get involved in maintaining
            the green spaces around their apartment blocks; they can “police” the neighborhood at
            night to ensure it is safe; they can organize community events; they can develop new
            infrastructure that benefits all; they can get involved in keeping the city clean; they can
            act as PR agents for potential investors or for potential tourists when travelling abroad;
            they can create public designs; they can provide their expertise for solving some of the

                                                              IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 163
                            city’s problems. Citizens are a force that local administrations seldom capitalize on.
                            However, the more involved citizens are in the future of their city, the more vested they
                            are in that future. When you know you have contributed, even if a tiny bit, to making
                            your city better, you become more attached to your city. An involved citizen is also a
                            more loyal citizen, and a citizen that is more likely to invest time, energy, and money to
                            ensure that his/her city will prosper.

                Investing in Education
                A more educated citizenry is a more productive citizenry. Investments in education can bring
                high rewards, although a good education system, on its own, is not a guarantee for good economic
                performance. As the report has shown, strong universities are a significant contributor to in-
                migration. The cities with the largest universities are also the cities that have attracted the most
                migrants in recent years – particularly younger and well-qualified people. A good education system
                also can contribute to strengthening the private sector, by better responding to the needs of firms.
                In what follows, we will discuss some investments in education local administrations could consider:

                        a)	 Strengthening universities. Universities are autonomous public or private entities,
                            with their own budgets and charters. The performance of these universities depends
                            largely on the management of the university, on the professors that teach there, and
                            on the students that chose to study there. However, universities do not operate in a
                            vacuum – they often need properly zoned land to expand, they need a good quality of life
                            for professors and students, and they sometimes require funding assistance for certain
                            projects. Local administrations should therefore strive to have open communication
                            channels with the universities operating within their boundaries, and to try to assist
                            these universities in becoming more competitive. The better off the universities will be,
                            the better off the city will be.

                        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: regional magnets, cross-county magnets, but also
                        other FUAs with larger or specialized universities]


                        b)	 Encouraging vocational and on-the-job training programs. Unfortunately, the
                            education system and educational curricula, changed much slower than the economy. In
                            just a few years, the economy of Romania has gone through a dramatic transformation
                            process. Many of the old and inefficient factories from the Communist period have went
                            bankrupt, and their place has been taken by different economic agents. Moreover, the
                            volume of Romanian exports has grown 8 times since 19899, indicating a much larger
                            and much more diverse economy. The curricula of educational facilities have not always
                            kept pace with this change. That is why many companies offer to teach classes at
                            schools/universities, to better prepare students for the types of jobs they offer. Such
                            programs are critical because they shorten the distance dramatically between future
                            employers and employees. Whenever possible, local administrations should assist with
                            establishing and nurturing the link between educational service providers and employers.

                        c)	 Good school management. While local administrations in Romania fund the salaries
                            of school teachers and are to a large extent responsible for investments in schools), they
                            don’t have a say in hiring and firing decisions of the school personnel – this is the job
                            of the county school inspectorates. This in itself is not a bad thing (it ensures that HR
                            policies are not politicized), but it is important for local administrations to at least play
                            a consulting role when the management of educational facilities is chosen. Moreover,
                            whenever possible, private sector entities should be consulted when school curricula are
                            elaborated – particularly in the case of vocational and technical schools. A strong link

                    between private sector labor needs and school curricula can help increase the number of
                    local jobs and firm productivity.

                d)	 Kindergartens in suburban areas. The most dynamic FUAs have seen a dramatic
                    rise of the population in suburban and peri-urban areas, particularly younger people and
                    families. Since this peri-urban growth has happened quite fast, many local authorities
                    in these areas have been unable to build the necessary educational infrastructure to
                    accommodate the population growth. In particular, the rate at which new kindergartens
                    have been developed has been slow, forcing parents to drive their kids to kindergartens
                    in the core city. This problem is not equally distributed, but some FUAs that have
                    underserviced outter areas include Cluj-Napoca, Iași, Sibiu, Baia Mare, or Piatra Neamț.

                e)	 Developing new nurseries. While the economy has been developing at a very rapid
                    pace, with people becoming more and more productive and having less and less time
                    available for other activities, there has been a dearth of new educational infrastructure
                    development, catering to babies – i.e. nurseries. As the table below highlights, the
                    infrastructure of nurseries is underdeveloped in virtually every FUA in Romania,
                    particularly when one compares it with the existent kindergarten infrastructure. This
                    unfortunately forces a lot of young professionals to either postpone having a baby, to
                    avoid having a baby altogether, to reduce workload, or to put the professional career on
                    hold for a while. Many of these decisions could be avoided if the proper infrastructure
                    were in place, to respond to the needs of young families.

                Investing in Specialized Healthcare
                The population of Romania is aging, putting more and more pressure on the healthcare
                system, but also requiring adequate responses to growing challenges from the public
                administration. The Government of Romania is working with the World Bank on a project that
                aims to rationalize the health-care infrastructure in the country, with a focus on increasing out-
                patient care and decreasing in-patient care. However, a lot of attention should also be paid to
                the management of health-care infrastructure at the local level. The health sector underwent a
                significant decentralization process, with most of the health-care facilities being passed under the
                administration of county councils or local administrations. As such, sub-national authorities provide
                part of the funding required to operate and maintain these health-care facilities, and part of the
                funding for rehabilitation / modernization / extension works. As these sub-national authorities
                prioritize their capital investments, it is important for them to determine how to also respond to
                people’s health care needs. For example, the World Bank has developed, together with the Office of
                the Ploiești Growth Pole, the integrated urban development strategy for the Ploiești Growth Pole. As
                part of the project prioritization exercise, the team has run a survey to find out what people’s public
                infrastructure priorities were. Healthcare infrastructure came in as the first priority. It is likely that
                this is the first priority for the citizens of other cities in Romania, particularly those with an aging
                population, but not exclusively.

166 I MAGNET CITIES - Migration and Commuting in Romania
Investing in Public Transportation
Good public transport is critical for commuters and for ensuring that people have a cost-
efficient way of getting around. For the 2014-2023 Implementation Period, virtually all larger
cities in Romania have elaborated, or are in the process of elaborating urban mobility plans, and
most of these plans include provisions for public transport development. These mobility plans already
provide key strategic directions the cities/FUAs should take, but it is worth mentioning some key
areas for intervention:

        a)	 Subsidize metropolitan public transport systems. 1.2 million Romanians commute
            every day to the FUAs of Bucharest and the 41 county capitals. O these, more than
            half commute to Bucharest and the 7 growth poles. As Romanian cities will develop,
            the number of commuters is likely to go up. It is therefore critical to have efficient
            public transportation systems in place that can ensure a seamless movement of people
            within a functional urban zone. Public transport systems have to service the entire
            metropolitan area, and center cities, which have the largest budgets, should subsidize,
            where needed, the functioning of these system. They are critical for the good operation
            of the metropolitan economy. Surprisingly, it is small cities, that have been leaders
            in this field. For example, the City Alba Iulia and several of its surrounding localities
            have set up a metropolitan transport system, operated by a private public transport
            company, which now serves as an example to other cities.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: primarily Bucharest, regional magnets, and cross-
        county magnets]


        b)	 Develop inter-modal transportation hubs to enable easier commuting. Some
            of the key interventions that can be considered include: 1) parking structures next to
            outlying public transport hubs, to enable as many commuters as possible to use public
            transport; 2) installing bike sharing facilities next to large public transport stops; 3)
            developing commuter bus line close to airports and railway stations, and connecting
            airports to main railway lines.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: primarily Bucharest, regional magnets, and cross-
        county magnets]


        c)	 Make public transport system more attractive. Public transport is always a good
            alternative to private care use. However, to ensure that as many people as possible
            use public transportation instead of the personal car, it is important to make the
            public transport system easily accessible, comfortable, and ubiquitous. Higher ridership
            numbers can also ensure a higher profitability of public transport companies.

        [The FUAs this measure most applies to: all]




Improving Land and Housing Markets
Dynamic and efficient land and housing markets are critical for cities that have a positive
development dynamic. As cities grow, they have to make it easier for people and firms to find
suitable places to live or operate in. If such suitable places are difficult to find, land, housing, and
office prices tend to go up, with potential negative effects on the local economy. Local authorities
cannot control land and housing markets, but they do have tools that can enable a more efficient
functioning of these markets. Some of these tools include:


                                                             IMPLICATIONS for EU, NATIONAL, and LOCAL POLICY I 167
                        a)	 Inventory of public lands. Local public authorities in Romania often have a poor
                            understanding of the land parcels and properties that are in their ownership. It
                            is therefore critical that all local administrations do a full inventory of their assets
                            and determine whether some of these assets could be put to productive use. In Cluj-
                            Napoca, for example, the local administration responded to the housing demand by
                            preparing a piece of land it owns (i.e. 82 hectares of land in the Borhanci Area) for new
                            housing development (spatial plan, utility networks, and road extensions) and it plans
                            to concession this land to private developers.

                        b)	 Super-taxes for unused and underused lands. The decline of the former Communist
                            industrial enterprise has left large parcels of unused and underused lands throughout
                            Romanian cities. Often times, these lands are not brought into productive use, because
                            the owners hope to sell the lands at a premium. Unfortunately, though, while the owners
                            wait for their big investor, these land parcels lie idle and unproductive, depriving the city
                            of potential tax revenues. It is therefore important that local administrations use the
                            option of super-taxing unused and underused lands, which the law currently permits.

                        county magnets]


                        c)	 Rental controls. Rental controls are used in many developed countries as a way of
                            addressing rampant rental price increases. Rental control basically provide protection to
                            long-term renters, by prohibiting the owners to increase rental prices to fast or too high.

                        county magnets]


                        d)	 Affordable housing. To offset the rise in land and housing prices, local administrations
                            can develop targeted affordable housing policies, which respond to the need of the less-
                            well-off. Some options for developing affordable housing include: 1) pubic investments in
                            new social housing units; 2) allowing private investors to build higher density buildings,
                            as long as a certain share of the units (e.g. 15%-20%) will be affordable units; 3) offering
                            land concessions to private developers in exchange for a certain number of affordable
                            housing units.

                Targeting Social Inclusion
                Economic growth and development does not have only winners. As cities develop, there is a risk
                that some people will be left behind. Currently, marginalized communities seem to overwhelmingly
                be clustered in rural areas, but the experience of developed countries shows that social pressures are
                likely to follow a rapid development process. It is therefore important that local authorities address
                issues pertaining to urban marginalization and exclusion early on, to ensure that small problems do
                not become big problems. Focusing on social inclusion is also smart economics, as more people in the
                community are thus enabled to reach their productive potential.

                The issues discussed here provide only a glimpse of policies that could be considered by local
                administrations. In addition, Annex 5 includes a framework that local authorities can use to become
                better at attracting people, firms, and tourists.

 The Index of Magnetism
       Methodology
The target of the analysis are the 40 county residence FUAs analyzed in the report, and the dependent variable (i.e.
the measure of success of these 40 FUAs) is the number of migrants these FUAs have managed to attract between
1990 and 2011 – the period of transaction to a market economy. As independent variables (i.e. factors that may have
generated higher migration numbers), we have tested a number of factors: total stable population in the FUA; share
of population of 0-29 years of age; share of population of 0-39 years of age; the number of students; GDP per Capita
for the county; net average wage; firm revenues per capita within the FUA; the Local Human Development Index; the
share of people working in high value-added sectors; investments expenditure per capita; unemployment share; share
of students in the total population; share of people with tertiary education; total FUA public budget; number of tourists
to the FUA; cultural vitality index of the FUA core city; average housing unit prices in the FUA core city; new housing
units; capital expenditures per capita in FUA core cities (a measure of the efficiency of the local administration); share
of active population by FUA; construction permits issued in the FUA; total number of employees in the FUA. In addition,
given that access to markets can have both a positive effect (boosting economic growth and private sector activity)
and a negative one (losing people and resources to the more developed place), we have also tested to geography-related
indicators: distance to the Western border; distance to Bucharest.

To avoid multicollinearity problems and reduce the number of relevant factors, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
was used. The PCA methodology groups independent variables into several components or factors, based on the intensity
of the correlation (e.g. firm revenues is likely to be correlated with GDP output). The components that are independent
of each other can be used as regressors. The analysis is carried out in several steps, and in each step, variables that
show no clear correlation are excluded from the analysis. The number of final components is established based on
variance. The first component will have the highest variance possible. Individual components are homogeneous inside
and heterogeneous among them.

The PCA methodology is based on the standardization of data, which allows for the computation of indexes, and can be
interpreted similarly to the standardized coefficients in linear regressions. For each component, a score can be computed
for each analyzed statistical unit. Several methods can be employed for this. In this case, we used the regression
approach.

After going through all the steps of the methodology, the following factor variables remained in the analysis:

        1.	   The total stable population;
        2.	   The number of students;
        3.	   The average monthly wage (Euro);
        4.	   Firm revenues per capita;
        5.	   Investments per capita;
        6.	   Distance from Bucharest.
                                                                                                                       451
The first four variables compound the first component, while the last two variables make up the second component.
The equations based on which the scores of the two components were computed are:



 1    C1 = 0.908*lpop + 0.778*lstud + 0.779*lturnover + 0.831*lwage + 0.046*linvest + 0.19*ldistBuc


 2    C2 = - 0.065*lpop + 0.198*lstud - 0.133*lturnover - 0.194*lwage + 0.754*linvest + 0.704*ldistBuc



To test the impact of these components on internal migration, a linear regression was undertaken. The first step was
to test the linerarity of the relationship between the regressor and the regressant. After the regression was run, it was
validated through post-etimation procedures. Both components turned out to be significant, with the first component
having the most significant influence. Using the regression results and the PCA equations the individual weights of all
the independent variables.

Migration between 1991 and 2011, follows according to this analysis the standardized formula below:



 Migration 1991-2011 = 0.847*C1 + 0.193*C2


This means that a 1 unit growth in C1, leads to a 0.847 growth in “Migration 1991-2011”. The influence of each
independent variable cand be assessed with the following formula:



 Migration 1991-2011 = 0.847*(0.908*lpop + 0.778*lstud + 0.779*lturnover + 0.831*lwage
 + 0.046*linvest + 0.19*ldistBuc) + 0.193*(- 0.065*lpop + 0.198*lstud - 0.133*lturnover -
 0.194*lwage + 0.754*linvest + 0.704*ldistBuc)



The weights of each independent variable have been identified in the table below:


      Total absolute effect                  %

  lpop               0.756531            23.38179

      Statistical Correlation
              Matrix
To provide more heft to some of the arguments made in this report, a large correlation matrix was run for all the
around 3,300 localities in Romania, to test a number of assumptions. Correlation analysis enables the evaluation of the
interactions between a host of variables. The significance of the correlation is considered for the three standard levels:
99%, 95%, and 90% (with significance levels at 1%, 5%, and 10%).

The direction of the relationship is given by the sign of the coefficient. A positive sign indicates a direct relationship,
indicating that the growth of one of the variables would be accompanied by a similar growth in the other variable. The
negative correlation coefficient indicates a reverse relationship – growth of one of the variables is accompanied by a
decrease for the other variables.

Another feature is the intensity of the relationship, which can be attributed as follows:

        -	   [0 – 0.3) – low intensity relationship;
        -	   [0.3 – 0.7) – medium intensity relationship;
        -	   [0.7 – 1) – high intensity relationship.

The variables used, the direction of the relationship between the variables, and the intensity of the relationship are
included in the matrix below.

The City Pyramid of Needs
The World Bank has provided direct technical assistance to the City of Alba Iulia in Romania, and has helped the
municipality develop a methodology for the prioritization of projects that takes into consideration the needs of citizens,
the private sector, and tourists. In essence, every project a local administration undertakes should be seen through such
a lenses – i.e. how does the project respond to the needs to citizens, investors, and tourists. To this end, the City Pyramid
of Needs methodology was developed, and this methodology was designed to help local authorities think about how they
can better cater to these three stakeholder groups.




The City Pyramid of Needs
The same way people define for themselves the issues that are most poignant for their personal development, so can
city leaders define the priorities that are critical for their locality. Abraham Maslow has defined a pyramid of needs that
has been used in the social sciences for over 70 years. In a similar fashion, a city’s pyramid of needs can be defined, and
identify how local authorities can respond better to the needs of those in the city. In effect, we discuss three types of
pyramids of needs: 1) the Citizens Pyramid of Needs; 2) the Private Sector Pyramid of Needs; 3) the Tourist Pyramid of
Needs. These three pyramids will be discussed in more detail below.


The Citizens Pyramid of Needs
A city’s citizens are without a doubt its main constituent group. Citizens elect the mayor and the local council, and
local authorities are directly responsible to them. Citizen needs can largely be clustered in the following five categories:
opportunities; housing and basic infrastructure; connectivity; effective and efficient administration; quality of life. These
will be discussed in more detail below.


                                                                             Annex 5: The City Pyramid of Needs I 469

                                             Connectivity
                                  (roads, highways, airports, rail, etc.)



                                Housing and Basic Infrastructure
                                  (water, wastewater, sanitation, etc.)


                                             Opportunities
                                (jobs, markets, education, healthcare, etc.)


Opportunities. The main attraction of cities are the opportunities they offer. People usually flock to cities because that
is where they can find jobs, where they can get education, healthcare, or where they can access larger markets. Usually,
the more opportunities a city offers, the larger it will be. And, conversely, the larger a city is, the more opportunities
it tends to attract – in a virtuous cycle. Consequently, city leaders have to identify ways to attract and generate
opportunities in their city, to make it more attractive to people – both from outside and from within the city.

Housing and basic infrastructure. The many slums of the world are a testament to the magnetic pull of cities. Many
people chose to live in squalor so they can have access to the opportunities the city offers. However, city leaders are
aware that such a situation is neither desirable nor sustainable. As such, one of the key functions of local governments
is to provide basic infrastructure and to allow housing markets to function properly.

Connectivity. For a city to thrive, it has to be well connected. The largest cities in the world are former port cities
situated on the coastline of major continents. Good connectivity means that people will have easier access to more
opportunities in the area (e.g., it will be easier for them to find another job), while firms will have easier access to a larger
labor pool and to larger markets.

Effective and efficient administration. Once a city provides opportunities, basic infrastructure, and connectivity,
people will expect and demand a good administration. They will want to be able to get to work without a hassle, to have
their streets cleaned, to be able to obtain licenses and permits easily, and so on. This requires continuous improvement
on the part of local administrations, as well as open communication channels to the general population and the
engagement of local communities.

Quality of life. Cities from the developed world largely provide all of the four ingredients described below. This in essence
means that people have a range of options to choose from. In order to attract and keep people, cities increasingly
resort to quality of life measures. Among other things this translates into a burgeoning cultural life, entertainment
opportunities, places for people to meet and greet, an active restaurant and bar scene, access to green spaces and
water bodies, beautiful buildings, good urban planning and good urban design. A recent study has shown that aesthetic
beauty is one of the things people valued most about a city.12

In addition to these key building blocks of the City Pyramid of Needs, there are two cross-beams that local authorities
should use as a filter for all the projects they propose: social inclusion and climate change.

Social inclusion. Regardless of how developed a city is, it will always have to deal with social inclusion issues – i.e.,
there will always be a share of the local population that will be less fortunate than the rest, or which will be directly
or indirectly discriminated against. Actively promoting social inclusion not only helps achieve social desiderates, but is
also a critical tool for achieving economic goals. For example, a World Bank study indicates that if the estimated Roma
population in Romania would work at the average productivity level in the country, the overall GDP would be boosted by
3%.13 Consequently, whenever devising a new project, local authorities should think how that particular project could also
help address social inclusion issues.

Climate change. The more cities develop, the more they tend to pollute. In fact, cities are responsible for around 70%
of global GHG emissions. Since they are a major part of the problem, they should also be a major part of the solution.
Initiatives, such as the Covenant of Mayors or ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability), have started to bring
together city leaders from all over the world, to kick-start a joint effort towards solving the global climate change
problem. Local authorities should therefore think their projects through a climate change lens, assessing whether that
projects helps address climate change issues or whether it makes matters worse.


The Private Sector Pyramid of Needs
The private sector is a city’s source of economic dynamism, and an active local economy is a magnet for people. Without
an active private sector, cities often wither away. For local authorities it is therefore important to identify ways to
address some of the key needs of the private sector. These can be grouped in the following categories: qualified labor
force; land and basic infrastructure; connectivity; effective and efficient administration; clusters.

                                             Qualified Labor Force



Qualified Labor Force. The key source of a company’s productivity are its people. It is people that think and design
products and services, it is people that ultimately produce these products and services, and it is people that market and
sell products and services. Thus when a company decides where to locate, or where an entrepreneur decides where to
start a business, the availability of qualified labor force is one of the first things they take into consideration.

Land, Office Space and Basic Infrastructure. Every business requires a place to operate from. Some companies
simply rent out or purchase an existent office space, some require a new plot of land to develop their facilities on. It is
therefore important for local authorities to have a good grasp of the availability of office space (i.e., vacancy rates) and
land parcels in the area (e.g., brownfields or greenfields). A dearth of office space and developable land may restrict
private sector development

Connectivity. Connectivity is paramount to the private sector. On the one hand, private companies require easy access
to a large enough labor pool of qualified labor. On the other hand, private companies need easy access to markets –
internal and external. Easy access to a qualified labor pool implies well developed local and regional infrastructure, to
allow easy commuting to the city for a large number of people in the region. Easy access to markets may require a
well-developed highway network, good airport, rail, and naval infrastructure, as well as the availability of a well-develop
(information and communication) ICT infrastructure.

Effective and Efficient Administration. Private companies require both public policies and public infrastructure to
function effectively. Some require that construction permits be made available in a timely fashion, some may require a
road connection to major infrastructure in the area, and some may require appropriate tax policies.

Clusters. As counterintuitive as it may sound, private companies need other companies in the same sector to be
effective. There is a wide literature, starting from the Alfred Marshall’s description of industrial districts in 19th century
England that show the benefits of co-location. Having other similar companies around allows an easier flow of ideas, a
more seamless access to qualified labor force, and higher productivity driven by local competition.

When attempting to attract businesses local authorities should also have in mind the two cross-beams mentioned for
the citizens pyramid of needs: social inclusion and climate change. Attracting any business, just because it creates local
jobs, may not be the best long-term strategy.

Social Inclusion. Most local authorities know that they cannot sustain growth if they only manage to attract low-
wage businesses. At the same time, high-profile examples like Silicon Valley show that neither is it sustainable to attract
only high-wage businesses. A healthy business mix includes both high-wage sectors (which are usually the source of a
city’s long-term growth) and business sectors that allow access to jobs for people with lower skills. In addition, local
authorities can encourage the location of businesses in poor neighborhoods and marginalized areas.

Climate Change. Since cities are the place where most businesses are located, they are also the place where most
green-house gases are generated. As such, local authorities have an obligation to address climate change challenges.
Among other things this may imply requiring higher environmental standards and stewardship from businesses.


The Tourist Pyramid of Needs
The large majority of cities are not a tourist attraction, even if they may be visited regularly by people. However, for
some, tourism represent a significant source of revenue. Cities with a clear tourist potential should look for ways
to meet the needs of tourists. These needs can be grouped in the following five categories: attractions; information;
connectivity; accommodation; quality services. These will be discussed in more detail below.

Attractions. Tourists go to where there is something to visit. Many local authorities like to fashion their cities as tourist
meccas, but when they look at the numbers they see that they did not manage to generate a lot of revenues from
tourism, nor did they manage to attract a lot of tourists. Even cities that continuously have their hotels full, may in
fact be visited by business travelers, not by people who were there to just visit the city. As such, local authorities have
to be very clear about what attractions they can offer tourists (e.g., historic sites, cultural heritage, entertainment,
gastronomy, culture) and find the best ways to showcase those attractions.

Information. Even the best attractions will remain unvisited if there is no information about them. If local authorities
determine that they have something that is worth visiting, they also have to find creative ways to market those
attractions to a well-defined target market.

Connectivity. The easier it is to an attraction, the more visitors it is likely to enjoy. Easy access to airports, major road
infrastructure, rail and naval hubs is critical in this respect, although it is not always within the means of just one local
authority to provide this connectivity.

Accommodation. If tourists do decide to visit a particular city, they have to have a place to stay. Local authorities are
not in the hotel business (this is an area that is almost exclusively covered by the private sector), but they can identify
creative ways to encourage the development of the sector – e.g., concession of land/buildings or the development of
business associations. In many Romanian cities, the hotel infrastructure is not yet properly developed, so even if these
cities have something worth visiting they are not prepared to receive tourists.

Quality Services. To have a sustainable source of revenue from tourism, it is important to continuously offer quality
services – this includes not only services offered by the private sectors, but also services offered by the public sector (e.g.,
quality public infrastructure, good public transport, a safe environment). This ensures that the tourists that get there
may consider coming back, or may consider recommending the place to someone else.

Attempting to meet the needs of tourist should also take issues pertaining to social inclusion and climate change into
consideration.

Social Inclusion. If a city benefits from tourism development it should identify ways in which tourism can benefit
the less well-off and the marginalized, while at the same time minimizing negative externalities. For example, the
rehabilitation of a historic center may end up displacing poor people that live in the area. Similarly, a decision to only
showcase the “good” parts of a city to tourists may end up isolating poor neighborhoods even more.

Climate Change. Issues pertaining to climate change should also permeate tourism development decisions. For example,
local authorities may develop a public transport network that allows tourists to seamlessly go from attraction to
attraction, rather than rely on cars to fill in this need.
