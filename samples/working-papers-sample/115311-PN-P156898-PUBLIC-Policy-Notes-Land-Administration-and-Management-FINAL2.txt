Improving Land Administration and Management for
Sustainable Urban Development*

1. Introduction and Approach

Land administration and management (LAM) systems are
a fundamental infrastructure for proper functioning of land
markets. Land markets enable land to flow to those who are
willing and able to use land well, thereby, facilitate investments
and growth, improve land allocation, and develop financial
markets. For land markets to work efficiently, they must be
underpinned by land administration systems that define
property rights; guarantee security of tenure; establish a
mechanism for registering these rights within reasonable
time and costs, and generate information to support property
valuation and taxation. Well-defined property rights underpin
security of transactions and investments in well-functioning
land markets, as these reduce conflicts, decrease transaction
costs, and provide incentives for the private sector to invest.                               use planning enables timely provision of investments to

compensation of land, equitable land and property taxation,                                   application of relevant regulations and development controls
and proper valuation of land as collateral assets.                                            are crucial to manage urbanization patterns and achieve the

      Box 1. Definitions
      Land administration is the processes of determining, recording and disseminating information about the tenure, value
      and use of land when implementing land management policies. These involve regulating land and property development
      and the use and conservation of land, the gathering of revenues from the land through sales, leasing and taxation, and the
      resolving of conflicts concerning the ownership and use of land (Dale and McLaughlin, 1999; UN ECE, 1996).

      Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good effect. It covers all activities concerned
      with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. It can include
      farming, mineral extraction, property and estate management, and the physical planning of towns and the countryside (UN-
      ECE, 1996).




Well-functioning land market and efficient land use are                                  real property constitute one of the most stable sources of

A number of interrelated issues affect LAM in the                  these agencies, which result in gaps or overlaps in land
Philippines. First, there are multiple agencies involved in land   records, existence of multiple titles on the same land, and fake
administration with considerable overlapping of mandates           and spurious titles. These, in turn, increase the transaction
and fragmentation of institutional responsibilities. There is      costs in securing, registering and transferring property rights
also lack of coordination and information sharing among            and undermine investor confidence in the titling system.

         Box 2. Examples of Land Administration and Management Deficiencies on Urbanization
         In a high profile case involving several upscale subdivisions in Quezon City, investigations are ongoing regarding a dispute with the
         landowners claiming to have the mother title to these properties.8 Similarly, there have been cases of duplicate and fake reconstituted
         titles issued after a fire at the Register of Deeds. At the National Government Center in Quezon City and nearby barangays occupied
         by informal settler families (ISFs), land syndicates exist, making misrepresentations about the property owner and exacting payments
         from poor communities for the right to stay.

         In Mandaue City, the fire that gutted the Registry of Deeds has resulted in thousands of lost title records, and owners are now only
         relying on tax declarations as proof of ownership. The cost of reconstitution is high ranging from Php 50,000 to Php 100,000 per
         parcel depending on the value, which is way beyond the affordability levels of most landowners. As a rapidly developing city, land
         transactions are based on tax declarations, with the new owners shouldering the cost of reconstitution, which could take months or
         years to complete. This deprives the original owners the benefit of exacting current market values for their properties, and also result
         in delays and additional costs in property development.

         In Cagayan de Oro city, a national developer is facing legal challenges after a claimant of Spanish title surfaced after the company
         started land development for a middle class subdivision. There are areas which are the subject of two surveys approved separately by
         LRA and DENR. There are also reported cases of multiple titles (certificate of land ownership awards, Free Patent, and transfer certificate
         of title ) issued on the same parcel. Based on estimates of the City Assessor, about 3-5% of prime lands are problematic (interviews
         with City Officials). Issues like these delay development, and could cause costly legal battles, if not resolved. Based on interviews with
         Brokers and Property Appraisers, large developers would go to great lengths at validating the reliability of records, by tracing back
         the origin of titles and ownership to three past previous owners, as well as the origin of the title from the approved subdivision plans.

         In Cebu City, the city government has put on hold its plans to develop part of the reclaimed property called the Campana Maritima
         because of the objection filed by the Cebu Ports Authority (CPA) claiming that they should have the right to the property. The property
         is located right at the back of the City Hall offices, near the 300-hectare South Road Properties (SRP). Its commercial value has increased
         following recent developments in the SRP, where mixed-use developments are ongoing. While both the CPA and City Government are
         interested in the development of the property as a maritime heritage museum, developments cannot proceed due to the ongoing
         dispute. A good portion of the property is now being used as a parking space – which is not an efficient use of this highly valuable land
         in the City center.9

         At some point, the Philippine Exporters Confederation, Inc. of Cebu has suggested the temporary use of a portion of Campana Maritima
         to ease the port congestion in Cebu International Port (CIP). The situation has delayed shipments, with an estimated loss of USD 15,000
         per shipment.10

    Weak Implementation




Land use plans provide a set of rules concerning land use and                           Implementation of CLUPs is likewise weak. Urban growth and

The Department of Finance has found a way to fill this gap by
publishing a LGU Scorecard called “Iskor ng Bayan” (Country
Scorecard) which rates local governments according to their
performance of financial management and revenue raising
responsibilities. This has somehow encouraged some Local
Executives to take action, as the campaign touches on the
LGU competitiveness spirit. It has also been undertaking
capacity development programs which has allowed a limited
number of LGUs to update their values using international
standards for valuation.


Despite these efforts, the task remains daunting as the
number of cities and provinces have to have innate capacities
and sufficient motivations for regular updates every three
years. Clearly, the impact has been reduced opportunities
for local governments, particularly rapidly growing cities, to
translate increasing property values into local revenues for
improved service delivery.




12 For example, among REGALA LGUs, a Tax Impact Study was conducted to determine the potential effects of updated values on RPT payments to property owners of
    different property classes. The results were used to develop various options for assessment so that owners of low-end properties do not necessarily share the bulk of
    the tax burden. In the end, the choice is left to the cities and stakeholders to determine the best combination of assessment levels that will help achieve the budgetary
    goals of the city, and yet is more equitable. Public support is also important, and this was sought by identifying the major programs where the proceeds of increased tax
    collections will be used. See Box on Tayabas City in the technical paper on Land Administration Management.

     Box 4. Improving Land Administration Quality in Republic of Korea

     In the Republic of Korea, lack of accurate spatial information on land undermined the ability to implement urban plans and to capture for
     public benefit some of the gains from enormous land value increases associated with rapid urbanization and industrialization. This led
     to formulation of a national master plan for GIS development, followed by open and interoperable standards to govern production and
     sharing of information, simplification of land use regulations that were too complex to be implemented transparently, and institutional
     change to eliminate duplication and include other players such as the Ministry of Justice. In view of high costs (about USD 415 million),
     implementation was sequenced to start in large and medium cities where demand was strong and the potential benefits highest. While
     meticulous checking of all the country’s 37 million land plots required a huge commitment of human capital, the resulting system
     now provides the basis for all urban planning, land administration, public land management, valuation and taxation, and zoning in
     development planning. It substantially reduced corruption and increased transparency of processes. For the 2007–11 period alone, an
     annual cost savings of about US$200 million was realized. The Republic of Korea is now expanding service delivery, while adapting to the
     growing use of mobile devices by clients, and integrating land administration in the overall e-governance program to better serve the

     taxation. The BLGF has issued the national valuation                           based on market values. These include: provision of
     standards and the Manual for Real Property Appraisal,                          incentives to those who will abide by the mandatory
     Assessment and Operations. Cost effective forms of                             general revision; and the establishment of a National
     delivery of capacity building include: (i) learning by doing                   Valuation Authority which will be responsible for
     through coaching and mentoring; (ii) accreditation of                          approving the values. In the long term, work towards
     service providers to ensure greater coverage. Likewise,                        the establishment of central mass valuation system
     strengthen BLGF oversight and monitoring of LGU                                that provides fair and timely estimates of property and
     Treasurers to ensure the administrative and judicial                           taxation values.
     remedies are utilized, to improve tax collection and collect
     delinquent payments. Administrative measures include:




     Box 5. Assessment of International Experience in the Use of Alternative Tenure Options
            for Mobilizing Land for ISFs
     Category 1 - Incremental Servicing as a Key Strategy

     Similar to Cordoba and Brasilia, the Philippines can adopt the incremental servicing scheme as a holistic strategy for slum upgrading within
     the context of urban development. Applied in the Philippine context, these could be used in idle lands, forfeited properties resulting from
     auction of delinquent properties, or in government owned lands that are occupied by ISF.

     Tenure security in this sense is undertaken as part of the package of urban development, similar to the Sites and Services Improvement
     program, and the Zonal Improvement Program. These are also consistent with the UDHA and the Urban Land Reform Law. This would
     require strong partnerships between the LGUs, NHA and the HOAs, in order to deliver services in an incremental manner, and to allow also
     the incremental housing development. Flexibility in the implementation of BP 220 is therefore key, as well as the combined effort of LGUs
     in service provision, and the SHFC, LGUs and other sectors in financing.

            for Mobilizing Land for ISFs (cont.)

     Category 2 - Instruments which can contribute to improvement of existing tenure arrangements.

     These represent those where similar features exist in the Philippines, but which can be improved based on good practices offered by the
     experiences of other countries:


     Communal Tenancy (Colombia) and Setting up of Community Land Trust (Kenya)
     The existing CMP can be improved by having an intermediary, such as an NGO or a HOA federation to set up a CLT to buy and develop
     properties into socialized housing units for low income dwellers. This is currently practiced by such NGOs as Gawad Kalinga and HABITAT
     for Humanity. This would spare the HOA or community organization from the difficulties associated with going through the complexities
     of acquisition, subdivision planning and other bureaucratic procedures to avail of funds and individualize the parcel. This process however,
     could be long and would therefore require commitment to see through its completion.

     Right now, the CAs/HOAs are left to themselves to understand the intricacies of land research, negotiations, and putting together all
     the requirements for loan approval and eventual subdivision. In the absence of an NGO, this role can be done by the SHFC, provided it
     considers broadening its mandate as facilitator for development of ISF communities.


     Private land rental schemes (Anticreto of Bolivia and Private Land Market of Thailand)
     Although temporary, securing formal lease agreements with owners of privately held properties could provide relief from the constant
     danger of eviction. These leases however, should be registered with the LGU in order to protect both parties, and ensure compliance with
     conditions.

     The lease agreements can serve as interim instrument in the meantime that negotiations with the owner and processing of loan
     applications are being worked out.


     Fixed Period State Grant (Botswana)
     This is similar to usufruct, except that unlike the certificates of ownership (COR) that is associated with FPSG, usufructs cannot be
     mortgaged or used to apply for loans. Moreover, the COR is just a temporary tenure instrument that can mature into FPSG. The FPSG is
     then registered with the local registry, which provides an added form of security to the holders.

     This scheme remains an option open to LGUs and NHA provided these are applied on government owned lands, and/or the government
     does not want to give up the ownership of property.


     Urban Housing Permit (Burkina Faso)
     This is similar to the Certificate of Land Allocation (CELA), which was issued as a form of interim tenure to occupants of publicly owned A
     and D lands provided they meet the minimum conditions. This form of instrument or CELA, can provide security of tenure in the meantime
     that the occupant has not yet fully satisfied the conditions required for the title to be issued – such as the 10 year possession.

     To be a stronger instrument however, this needs to be recorded and registered at the DENR, LGU and RoD.

              for Mobilizing Land for ISFs (cont.)

       Category 3 - Instruments that are worth testing given existing policies

       This set of instruments pertain to those that have potential to improve schemes where there are existing policies, but implementing
       procedures are largely undeveloped. These would require pilot testing and then preparation of detailed guidelines based on experience.


       Zona Especial de Interesse Social (ZEIS) and Concession of the Real Right to Use (CRRU) in in Brazil)
       Special land development and regulations can be applied by LGUs in areas identified in APDs. Since there are no available tenure
       instruments that can be given to occupants of APDs similar to the CRRU of Brazil, the LGU can provide temporary administrative recognition
       thru certificates of occupancy, in the meantime that acquisition of privately owned portions of APDs are being worked out. In case the APD
       falls on government lands, the NHA can apply for Proclamation or the LGU may apply for Special Patent, and then the properties can be
       disposed to occupants either through usufructs or individual titles.


       Housing cooperatives in South Africa
       The strength of the cooperative law can be tested to develop housing cooperatives to secure titles and mobilize land. Existing HOAs
       can be transformed into coops provided there is joint interest to set up the entity. For the members, this could mean having their own
       investments in property development, which they can recover once they have the means to move out of the coop once their socio
       economic conditions improve. The combined support of CDA, NGOs, HOAs, LGUs and shelter agencies would be essential to pilot such a
       scheme.


       Land Readjustment in Benin
       This is similar to the reblocking scheme applied in on site development, except that under reblocking, there is minimal dislocation; and
       that under land readjustment, the resulting lay out and plan is more structured and conforms better to standards and provision for service
       areas.

       This would require however, high level of commitment of the individual households and trust in the resulting land readjustment scheme.
       Furthermore, support from the government (LGU or NHA) should be forthcoming to facilitate surveys and development of facilities and
       service areas for the communities. The advantage is that the resulting lay out blends better with the urban fabric, reducing the extent of
       blight.

       In the same vein, the operative law would be PD 1517, except that there have been no example to speak of, nor implementing rules
       developed for this purpose.
