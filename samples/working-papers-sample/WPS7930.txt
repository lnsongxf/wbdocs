                                        1.     Introduction

        The idea that incorporating women into the formal workforce contributes to economic

development is now well established.1 The effects of globalization on women’s employment and

earnings, however, remain debated. The male-female wage gap changes over time but the forces

that drive the changes in the wage gap are not well understood. Globalization is considered to be

one of the important drivers of employment and wages in developing countries. Papers that focus

on tariff reductions, such as Juhn et al. (2013, 2014) and Aguayo-Tellez (2010), find that tariff

reductions favor women in both employment and consumption. Klein et al. (2010) find a similar

result in Germany: increasing exports reduce gender wage inequality. Saurè and Zoabi (2014),

however, find that an increase in the output price of the female-intensive sector raises both male

and female wages (so that the relative wage does not change in the short run), but, as males

reallocate towards the female-intensive sector, the gender gap widens.

        These papers build on previous work that was equally contentious2 and reflect the

beginning of a shift in the way the globalization-gender earnings relationships are analyzed.

Early papers were based on discrimination models that predicted that globalization would

increase competition, which would make discrimination less feasible. A new wave of models,

however, has begun to apply traditional trade theory (e.g., the Heckscher-Ohlin and Stolper-

Samuelson theorems) to analyze the effect of globalization on gender-based earnings. This new

wave includes several common characteristics. First, males and females are treated as separate

factors that are not necessarily differentiated by skill (e.g., Galor and Wiel 1996).3 Second,

studies in this new wave include output price changes, either directly or indirectly (through

tariffs). Third, they differentiate industries by female intensity.
                                                                                                      4

       The goal of this paper is to describe how global price changes may affect women’s wages

in developing countries. Specifically, this descriptive paper contributes to this new wave of

literature in three ways. First, it focuses on the apparel industry. In developing countries women

often enter the formal sector though the apparel industry. Apparel is perhaps the most prominent

labor-intensive and female-intensive globalized manufacturing sector. The disasters in

Bangladesh apparel factories in 2012 and 20134 stimulated an intense debate around the value of

apparel exports and employment in developing countries. In this debate, the costs of disasters,

low wages, and poor working conditions are contrasted with the benefits of incorporating women

into the formal labor force. Understanding how both the growth of apparel exports and major

policy changes affect women is a critical element of the debate surrounding the apparel export

model. Tremendous changes in the apparel sector over the decade from 2001 to 2010 have had

significant implications for women in developing countries and, therefore, for development.

       Second, we apply a simple model in which men and women are treated as different

factors whose absolute and relative wages are driven by output price changes. Our simple model

illustrates how the effects of changes in output prices are different in the short run and the long

run, following the spirit of recent work (including Do et al. 2011). We extend these papers by

differentiating the short run and long run. Adjustment costs are central in a new wave of trade

models,5 and our simple theoretical model illustrates how the presence of short-run adjustment

costs generates the prediction that a negative price shock to a specific sector would lead to a

decrease in wages in that sector relative to other sectors in the short run. In the medium run,

when factors are free to adjust, the model predicts a relative decrease of wages to a sector-

specific factor (in our case, female workers) in the overall economy.
                                                                                                  5

       Third, we apply the model to two leading apparel-exporting countries: Sri Lanka and

Cambodia. They provide excellent opportunities to compare the effects of changes in the apparel

exporting sector on women. Both countries are likely to be considered “small” in the theoretic

sense of having negligible effects on world prices. Thus, Cambodia and Sri Lanka are excellent

cases that may illustrate the potential effects of the end of the MFA on female employment and

the gender wage gap. As in many low-wage developing countries, apparel is the key

manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka and Cambodia. In Sri Lanka the apparel sector employed

270,000 workers, or 13 percent of its industrial workforce in 2008.6 In Cambodia, apparel

employed around 325,000 workers or 30 percent of the country’s total industrial workforce in

2008. Female workers dominate apparel sector employment in both countries, making up 70

percent and 83 percent of the apparel workforce in Sri Lanka and Cambodia respectively.7

       Both Sri Lanka and Cambodia were significantly affected by the Multi-Fibre

Arrangement (MFA), which from 1974 on was the major policy governing textile and apparel

trade between industrialized and developing countries.8 Cambodian and Sri Lankan exports grew

remarkably during the MFA era. The end of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement on January 1, 2005

induced a dramatic redistribution of the allocation of global apparel production (Staritz 2011;

Lopez Acevedo and Robertson 2012)9 and a dramatic drop in global apparel prices (Harrigan and

Barrows 2009).

       Our approach, which is similar to the approach used by Acosta and Gasparini (2007),

illustrates how these short-run and medium-run responses to price changes can be estimated with

conventional empirical techniques from labor economics. We find that the apparel wage

premium10 rose when exports began to grow under the MFA but dropped (less than the initial

increase) following the MFA phase-out in both Sri Lanka and Cambodia. Even though the
                                                                                                     6

apparel wage premium improved in the following years, it never regained its pre-MFA phase-out

levels. Furthermore, the male-female wage gap widened in the post-MFA period in both

countries, as predicted.

       The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section two presents the simple theoretical

model. Section three provides relevant context by describing export, price, and employment

trends in Cambodia and Sri Lanka. Section four contains the empirical results. We conclude in

section five.


                                  2.    Theoretic Foundation

       Following Bernard et al. (2007) we present a simple Melitz-like model (Melitz 2003) in

which firms differ by idiosyncratic technology and have two factors. Bernard et al. (2007) show

that the introduction of firm-level heterogeneity may not affect the traditional Heckscher-Ohlin

prediction of endowment-based trade determination and its effects (e.g., the Stolper-Samuelson

relationship between output price changes and relative factor earnings). Juhn et al. (2014) apply

the same logic with the two factors being defined by gender and use Mexican data to test some of

the model’s implications. Our model is more modest in presentation but is meant to capture the

essential features of these models, with the goal of simply illustrating the different effects and

empirical implications of short- and long-run price changes.

       To begin, consider a model with two goods, (a) and (b). At the firm level, goods are

produced with three factors: males (m), females (f), and a single unit of capital (k). The fixed unit

of capital that is necessary for production leads to diminishing returns to scale. The assumption

of fixed capital reflects our focus on the short and medium run. We will define the medium run

as the period in which labor is mobile between industries, and the short run as the period in

which labor is not mobile. The capital represents an idiosyncratic amount of technology
                                                                                                     7

represented by φi for firm i. The ex ante productivity parameter distribution is described by

g(,k2 ) and follows an exponential distribution.11

        As in many trade models, we take the price of good b to be the numeraire. Production in

industry j  ( a , b ) and firm i is the result of combining inputs according to a sector-specific

production function, such as

        (1)                          yij  A(k(), mj , f j ) .  


        Without loss of generality, we assume that industry a is female intensive and, for

simplicity, that the male-female employment ratio is not affected by the firm-specific technology

parameter.12

                                           C (w f , wm , f , m)
        (2)                       Py                            Sd .  
                                                   

        The variables P, φ, wf, and wm uniquely define the profit-maximizing level of output and

the combination of male and female employment. An increase in the output price, TFP, and the

individual-specific productivity parameter increase factor demand at the firm level.

        The firms incur a fixed cost to set up production, which we denote Sd. The difference

between revenue and cost must be at least as large as Sd for the firm to stay in the market and

produce. The result is a cutoff value for φ that is required for the firm to remain in the market.

Firms opting to leave the market truncate the ex post φ distribution, which results in higher

average productivity levels than in the ex ante distribution of firms.
                                                                                                       8


A. Open Economy

       Firms incur a fixed cost to export, which we denote Sx. To export, the firm must be a

viable domestic producer. We make the usual assumption that international transportation costs

follow an “iceberg” model, which suggests that Qτ goods must be exported for the quantity Q to

arrive (τ > 1). Firms in sector a that export, therefore, earn more than firms that produce only for

the domestic market. The model can be simplified by assuming that the export price (Px) is a

fixed markup over the domestic sales price (Px = τP). The model easily accommodates foreign

tariffs in that τ = premium divided by tariff. Higher foreign tariffs reduce the premium and,

eventually, reduce exports to zero. Assuming away corner solutions, firms will choose to export

if

                     C ( wm , w f , m, f )                       C ( wm , w f , m, f )
       (3)  Px y                             Sd  S x  Py                             Sd  0 . 
                                                                         

       The result of the additional fixed cost is that firms that export are more productive and

larger than firms that do not export.




B. General Equilibrium

       Sector b produces exclusively for the domestic market with homogeneous technology.

Assume that the second sector is characterized by decreasing returns to scale. Factor demand in

sector b can be characterized by

       (4)                            y(m, f )  f (, , wf , wm ) ,  


in which the parameters κ and λ characterize the implied factor demand functions. Under the

assumption of full employment, employment of males and females in the second sector is equal
                                                                                                      9

to the total population of each worker type minus employment of each type in the first sector.

Homogenous firms implies that we can represent aggregate relative factor demand with a single

demand function, and that all workers of a given type receive the same labor income. The result

is that wages of each factor are determined in the aggregate labor market and equalize across

sectors.

       It is important at this point to distinguish wages, which we have used so far, from

income. In sector b, decreasing returns to scale implies that the total factor payments are less

than the value of production. The remainder of the value of production is shared equally among

the workers. In other words, income is the integral of the marginal revenue product from zero to

total employment in sector b divided by total employment in sector b. Income is equal to the

wage, which is determined competitively in the factor demand market, plus the “profits” that

accrue to the firms from having the marginal revenue product being less than the total value

generated by the workers.

       The income in sector b effectively defines the reservation wage because sector b is the

residual sector. If workers are perfectly mobile between sectors, income in sector b (rather than

wages) becomes the minimum income in the heterogeneous sector. Workers have the chance to

earn more in sector a because profits are (potentially) higher in heterogeneous firms. Thus

workers either work in the sector b for income Ib or in the heterogeneous sector for at least Ib.

Workers in the heterogeneous sector queue for jobs in the sense that sector a can hire as many

workers as they want as long as they offer at least the reservation wage. Employment decisions

at the firm level in the heterogeneous sector are based on yb because profits are realized ex post.

In the heterogeneous sector, firms sort into three categories based on the productivity draw: those

that close, those that produce for the domestic market, and those that export. In this way, the
                                                                                                   10

model generates both inter-industry and intra-industry trade, which is qualitatively similar to

Bernard et al. (2007).

       Income for workers in the heterogeneous sector is then

                                                       i
       (5)                              I ai  I b         ,  
                                                       Ei

which is the income they could earn in the homogenous sector plus an equal share of the firm-

specific profits (note that E is equal to the sum of m plus f ). Note that equation (5) has important

implications for empirical work. A positive price shock will affect income by increasing the

second component directly. The positive price shock will only affect the first component to the

extent that factor markets clear. The first component is the economy-wide return to being a given

factor. The second component is effectively industry specific. Our estimation approach

decomposes these two terms and compares how these individual components are related to

product-level prices in Cambodia and Sri Lanka.

       Changes in prices generate general-equilibrium dynamics that are consistent with the

predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model in the following sense: when workers are perfectly

mobile, an increase in the relative price of the female-intensive good will increase the demand

for females throughout the economy and thus will close the male-female wage gap. In the short

run, however, increases in prices will only increase wages in the sector experiencing a price

increase. In other words, in the short-run, a sector-specific shock will increase the sector-specific

wage and will not affect the equilibrium wage differential because the wages of both males and

females would increase. Once factors are able to move, the sector-specific price shock will result

in a differential increase in the demand for the factor intensively used in the sector that

experienced the price increase. Our empirical strategy, therefore, is to decompose wages into the
                                                                                                  11

sector-specific and factor-specific wages and compare those with changes in industry output

prices.


                    3.    The Apparel Sector in Cambodia and Sri Lanka

          Sri Lanka has a long tradition in apparel. Before 1977 the Sri Lankan apparel sector was

very small with a few locally owned firms working for the domestic market. Trade liberalization

in 1977, however, immediately attracted foreign investors from East Asia to Sri Lanka. Over

time, Sri Lankan owners started dominating the apparel sector; in 1999 approximately 80 to 85

percent of factories were locally owned (Kelegama and Wijayasiri 2004).

          Due to its decades of political and civil unrest, Cambodia was a latecomer to the apparel

industry. The modern Cambodian industry was established only in the mid-1990s by investors

from Hong Kong SAR, China; Malaysia; Singapore; and Taiwan, China. In Cambodia,

approximately 93 percent of apparel factories were foreign owned in 2009 (Natsuda, Goto, and

Thoburn 2009). In this section, we provide context for our empirical results by examining the

trends in exports, unit values, and the labor market.

          In Cambodia the number of workers in the industry continued to grow because of

industry expansion. In Sri Lanka, apparel employment declined because of industry

consolidation. Given that women represent the major share of employment in apparel

manufacturing, the general employment trends are directly applied to women. Employment in

Cambodia’s apparel sector mushroomed from fewer than 19,000 workers in 1995 to

approximately 270,000 in 2004 (Staritz and Frederick 2011a). Growth continued after the MFA

phase-out, with operating employment reaching 353,017 workers in 2007 (see figure 1). After

2007, employment dipped to 281,855 in 2009, but recovered to 335,342 in 2011. Employment

levels in Sri Lanka’s apparel sector increased from 102,000 in 1990 to 340,367 in 2004,
                                                                                                                        12

accounting for more than a third of manufacturing employment in 2004 (Staritz and Frederick

2011b). As the industry started consolidating13 firms after the end of the MFA, employment

declined by approximately 18 percent to 280,000 in 2009 (see figure 1).

                              In addition to employment, working conditions directly impact a worker’s well-being

through the number of hours that are worked overtime, a hazardous work environment, social

benefits, or workplace discrimination. But working conditions also have an indirect impact on

employment and wage opportunities through the demand side: buyers might pay lower prices or

refuse to buy at all if they know that producers exploit child labor or mistreat employees.
                                                                                                     13

       The Cambodian and Sri Lankan governments had different strategies to improve working

conditions in the apparel sector. Sri Lanka, as a part of its Five-Year Strategy, designed

international and local campaigns to improve the image of the apparel sector and working

conditions. The 2006 international image-building campaign was called Garments without Guilt,

and the 2008 local campaign was called Abhimani (“pride”). Despite these efforts, working

conditions are still far from ideal. As mentioned earlier, labor costs in Sri Lanka are lower than

in China and India. Besides low wages, other issues have been problematic in parts of the apparel

sector, particularly in smaller firms. These issues include the lack of appointment letters, long

working hours, high work intensity, and, in particular, denial of the right of association and

collective bargaining (as many firms are reluctant to recognize trade unions) (Staritz and

Frederick 2011b).

       Cambodia has a good record of labor compliance because of the Better Factories

Cambodia program that began in 1999. Through this program, compliance with international

labor standards was directly linked to the apparel export quotas that Cambodia received from the

United States. In the 2004 Foreign Investment Advisory Service survey of the 15 largest U.S.

and European Union (EU) buyers of Cambodian apparel, Cambodia was rated the highest on

“level of labor standards” and “protecting the rights of workers to organize unions” among Asian

apparel-exporting countries, including Bangladesh, China, Thailand, and Vietnam (Staritz and

Frederick 2011a). The MFA phase-out coincided with the expiration of the U.S. quotas in 2004,

which eliminated the incentive motive of Better Factories Cambodia (Staritz and Frederick

2011a). Nevertheless, the Cambodian government encouraged the apparel sector to continue with

the program to maintain its reputation for compliance with good labor standards in order to

remain attractive to the foreign investors.

3.1. Exports

           After the Cambodian apparel industry took off in the late 1990s, exports quadrupled

within a decade, growing from US$578 million in 1998 to US$2.4 billion in 2004 (see figure 2).

According to the Garment Manufacturers’ Association in Cambodia (GMAC), apparel accounted

for only 3 percent of Cambodia’s total exports in the early 1990s, but by 2003 it constituted 76.4

percent. Sri Lanka, already a seasoned apparel exporter in the mid-1990s, experienced a healthy

but more moderate growth than Cambodia, with exports rising from US$1.7 billion in 1995 to

US$3 billion in 2004 (figure 2). In the late 1990s, however, export growth slowed, and exports

even declined in 2001, 2002, and 2008 (figure 2).14

         Despite pessimistic expectations for the apparel sectors post-MFA, both countries

continued increasing apparel exports, though growth slowed somewhat. Sri Lanka expected that

exports would decrease by half and that 40 percent of firms would close in 2005 (Kelegama and

Epaarachchi 2002). Sri Lankan apparel exports, however, grew 6 percent annually on average,

and their value increased by approximately US$1 billion over 2005–08. In Cambodia

immediately after the MFA removal, total apparel exports increased to US$2.7 billion in 2005

and to US$5.6 billion in 2011, a rise of almost 14 percent annually. The fact that these two

countries continued to be important apparel producers makes them interesting cases for our

study.


3.2. Unit Values

         In the neoclassical model presented in section 2, output prices drive wages. We use unit

values as a proxy for output prices,15 following Harrigan and Barrows (2009). Our unit value

data come from both OTEXA and Comtrade, two well-known official sources of apparel trade

data. We compute weighted averages of unit values by dividing total value by a common

quantity measure (square meter equivalent in the United States data and kilograms in the

European data). We use data from both the United States and the EU because the end markets of

both areas are highly concentrated, with 87 to 90 percent of total Cambodian and Sri Lankan

apparel exports going to those two destinations. Export products in both Cambodia and Sri

Lanka are highly concentrated in a few items. The Sri Lankan apparel industry focuses on higher

value-added products, such as lingerie. Unit values of apparel exports from India and Sri Lanka

to the EU are higher than those of Asian competitor countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia,

China, Pakistan, and Vietnam (Tewari 2008).
                                                                                                  16

       On the other hand, the unit prices of Cambodia’s main export products are lower than the

world average. For EU-15 exports, unit prices in 2005 were lower than in India, Sri Lanka, and

Vietnam, but higher than in Bangladesh, China, and Pakistan (Tewari 2008). One of the reasons

for the low prices of Cambodian apparel exports is that Cambodian apparel manufacturers

concentrate on the production of basic products, while other countries export higher-value

products.

       In both Cambodia and Sri Lanka, unit values show declining trends following the end of

the MFA. Figure 3 contains the weighted averages of the dollar-value square-meter equivalent

apparel imports into the United States from Sri Lanka and Cambodia. The unit values for both

countries fall after the end of the MFA, but recover after the great trade collapse of 2008. As

Cambodia entered the global market (1998–2001), unit values rose sharply. They fell in Sri

Lanka over the same time period. China’s entrance into the WTO corresponds with a drop in unit

values in Cambodia, while unit values rose in Sri Lanka. U.S. import prices experienced sharper

declines than those of the EU. Between 2004 and 2008 the average price of apparel exports to the

United States fell by 25 percent, from US$52 to US$39 per dozen. Sri Lankan apparel export

unit prices to the United States declined from US$59 to US$42 per dozen items over this period.

The average price of apparel exports to the EU-15 declined by 7 percent, from €13.4 to €12.5 per

kilogram between 2004 and 2008 as shown in figure 4 (U.S. International Trade Commission

(USITC) and Eurostat data; see Staritz and Frederick 2011a).

         The declining trends in unit values were expected. After the MFA phase-out, the

competitive pressure in apparel exports increased, which inevitably led to a decrease in apparel

prices. According to the simple model described in section 2, the decline in apparel prices should

have resulted in apparel manufacturing wages decreasing in the short run and in female wages in

all industries declining in the long run (in approximately three to five years). The next subsection

provides empirical evidence for these theoretical results.

                              4.    Data and Empirical Results


4.1 Data Description

        We combine household and labor force surveys from each country. The Cambodian data

come from the cross-sectional Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES), which is collected by

the National Institute of Statistics. We use data from the 1996, 1999, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009,

2010, and 2011 surveys, which contain roughly 12,000 households each. These are cross-

sectional household surveys that contain detailed household and individual information,

including wage, education, age, marital status, gender, location, industry, occupation, some

working conditions, and the hours worked.

        For Sri Lankan data, we use the 1992–2002, 2008, 2011, and 2012 waves of the cross-

sectional Sri Lanka Labor Force Surveys (LFS) and 2006 wave of the Sri Lanka Household

Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), which are carried out by the Sri Lankan Department of

Census and Statistics. These surveys cover approximately 30,000–60,000 individuals each. They

contain information about work-related activities (for example, employment status, occupation,

industry, and wages); household characteristics (for example, size and location); and individual

demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and education, among others.

        Apparel workers in Cambodia and Sri Lanka share a number of characteristics. First, the

share of the total labor force employed in the textiles and apparel industry was relatively small

and remained stable after the end of the MFA: 5 percent in Cambodia and 6 percent in Sri Lanka

(see table 1).
                                                                                                                                        20

       Second, the apparel sector is female dominated. The female share of employment in

apparel was 71 percent in Sri Lanka (2012) and 85 percent in Cambodia (2011). In both

countries, this share was much higher than the proportion of females in the total employment: 51

percent in Cambodia and 32 percent in Sri Lanka. Moreover, the share of females in apparel

remained relatively stable in both countries after the MFA phase-out. By nearly any definition,

the apparel sector is female intensive.

       Third, the labor force working in apparel was more educated than the country average. In

Cambodia in 2011, an average person had 6.3 years of education, while an apparel sector

employee had 7.1 years of education. In Sri Lanka in 2012, where the population is more

educated on average than in Cambodia, the average person had 8.8 years of education compared

to 10.2 years for an apparel sector worker.

       Fourth, men working in the apparel sector are more educated than women. In Cambodia

in 2011, women had on average 6.9 years of education while men had 8.2 years. This gap was

smaller for Sri Lanka in 2012, with 10.2 years of schooling for female workers and 10.3 years for

male workers. But these differences are representative of the gender education gap in general in

these countries, rather than a gap that is specific to the apparel industry. On average, wages were

higher in textiles and garments than in agriculture in both countries (see table 2) but lower than

the economy-wide average.

4.2 Decomposing the Gender Wage Differential

           The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition is a very well-known technique that is generally

applied in studies of gender wage differentials. Men and women may have different wages for
                                                                                                  24

many reasons. Some are easily observable (such as differences in education, age, and

occupation) and others, such as discrimination, are considered to be usually unobservable to the

researcher. The decomposition technique separates the observed wage differences into the

observable and unobservable components.

       The decomposition involves estimating separate wage equations for men and women that

include age, education, and other observable variables on the right-hand side. The estimated

coefficients are therefore allowed to differ by gender. The approach then applies the estimated

coefficients from, say, the male equation to the female data to estimate a possible counterfactual

wage value for women. The difference between the two earnings can therefore be expressed as

the part due to the differences in the observable and the unobservable characteristics.

       The Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions shown in tables 3 and 4 include hours worked, age,

age squared, and education as observable characteristics. The decompositions show that in

Cambodia the gender differential falls between 11 percent and 32.5 percent, and that it grew,

overall, between 1996 and 2011. About two thirds of the differential could not be explained by

the observed characteristics that we included. In Sri Lanka, the wage gap also increased over

time from 15.6 percent in 1993 to 23.5 percent in 2012. Similarly, unexplained characteristics

accounted for a large portion of the differential. The large role of the unexplained component

suggests that globalization generally, and apparel prices in particular, could be playing a

significant role through the general equilibrium effects that apparel price changes have in the

economy.

4.3. Estimation Issues and Specification

       The Mincerian equation takes a hedonic approach to decompose earnings into

components attributed to separate characteristics (equation 6). We use pooled cross-sectional

data to regress the logarithm of the wages16 for worker k on a set of worker characteristics such

as gender (      ); age (      ;	       ; years of education (      ); hours worked17 (   ); industry

dummies18 (         ), including a textile and garment industry dummy (TGk); occupation dummies19

(       ); a year dummy (year) equal to the value of one for the year 2005 and beyond; an

interaction term between TGk and the year dummy; and a remaining match-specific component

that is captured in the residual term    .



log             β                                                            ∑

∑                   ∗	              ∗    ∗      	                                         (6) 




       We correct for the possibility of selection bias that comes from the censoring of female

wages by using the two-step Heckman approach. Participation is defined as having positive wage

value, and the variables used in the selection correction equation are gender, age, age squared,

years of education, and a series of dummies for marital status, which serve as an exclusion

restriction since they are not included in the wage regression.20

       If adjustment costs matter, the effect of a decrease in industry j’s price would have

separate short-run and long-run effects on wages. In the short run, the decrease in price would

affect the industry-specific component of the wage and would show up as a contemporaneous

decline in the estimated, industry-specific, textiles and garments (T&G) coefficient       as implied
                                                                                                     27

by equation 6. The estimated coefficients on the industry dummy variables are interpreted as

“inter-industry wage differentials” following Krueger and Summers (1987).

       In the long run, the price decrease would affect the “general” component of wages. In our

apparel industry application, as long as industry j is female-intensive (we assumed that T&G is

female-intensive), any decrease in the price of industry j (T&G in our case) will affect      1 , which

represents the gender wage gap. Of course, what time frame constitutes the “long run” is not

clear at the start. Estimates of the relevant time frame for “long run” effects are rare. Robertson

(2004) suggests that the Stolper-Samuelson effects begin to emerge in three to five years.


4.3. Main Results

       Table 5 presents the results of wage regressions for Cambodia and Sri Lanka in the short

run and table 6 presents the results of wage regressions for both countries in the long run. The

regression analysis was carried out using the methodology described in section 2. For our

analysis, we used eight rounds of the Cambodian Socio-Economic Surveys that covered the

1996–2011 period, and the 1992–2002, 2008, 2011, and 2012 Sri Lankan Labor Force Surveys.21

       In both countries, working in apparel pays a premium compared to the economy

average.22 Column 1 of table 5 shows that the MFA-era wage premium was 39.2 percent in

Cambodia and column 3 of table 5 shows that this premium was 6.7 percent in Sri Lanka. This

result contrasts with table 4, which might be interpreted as demonstrating that the apparel sector

is a low-wage “sweatshop” sector. In comparison to international wages, wages are indeed low in

the apparel sector. But table 5 shows that relative to alternatives for similar individuals

(generally younger, unmarried, less-educated females), the apparel jobs (T&G dummy) pay

higher than average.23

Note: Standard errors are in parentheses. Standard errors are clustered at the industry level. Statistically significant
coefficients at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level are indicated by one, two, and three asterisks respectively.
   The grand mean effects of the industries are calculated; post-MFA is a dummy equal to 1 for years 2005 and later;
additional controls include age squared, industry, and occupation dummies. Sri Lanka Household Income and Expenditure
Survey was excluded from the analysis as hours worked were not available in this survey. Occupation dummies are
according to 1-digit ISCO-08; the omitted category is managers. Industry dummies include 15 categories: Agriculture and
Forestry; Mining; Food, Beverage, and Tobacco; Textile and Apparel; Wood; Other Manufacturing; Utilities; Construction;
Sales; Transport; Financial, Insurance, and Real Estate; Public Administration; Social Services; and Other Services. Log
wages are measured as logarithm of real monthly individual labor income. Log wages are measured as logarithm of real
monthly individual labor income in 2005 prices. The omitted time category in cols (1) and (3) is 2004 and earlier; the
omitted time category in cols (2) and (4) is 1998 and earlier.

          Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate that the unit values of apparel exports fell in both countries

after the MFA phase-out. The theory predicts that the fall in apparel prices should translate into a

drop in the apparel premium. Table 5 shows that in both countries we observe a short-run drop in

the apparel premium following the end of the MFA. The interaction with post-MFA and the

T&G sector (apparel) is negative and significant in both countries. In Cambodia, the apparel

wage premium declined post-MFA by 23 percent compared to other industries, but still remained

16 percent higher than the economy average. In Sri Lanka the apparel premium fell by to 4.3

percent after the MFA phase-out.

          An alternative specification separates the pre-MFA period using 1999 as a dividing year.

This is especially important for Cambodia, which entered the international market around 1999.

Figure 4, for example, shows a large increase in the unit value of apparel exports between 1998

and 2000 in Cambodia. The pattern of apparel wage premiums matches the price movements

shown in figure 4. The wage premium increased 68.6 percentage points in the 1999–2004 period

when the apparel price was increasing. In the MFA period, the premium fell but remained 38.3

percentage points higher than in the pre-1999 period. This pattern also matches the changes in

unit values shown in figure 4.

          In Sri Lanka, where the price movements were more moderate, we see smaller changes in

the apparel wage premium. Figure 3 shows that the unit values in the 1999–2004 period were

lower than in the 1998–1999 period, and that they continued to fall after the end of the MFA.

The estimated apparel wage premiums in table 5 (column 4) follow the same pattern: they were

lower in the 1999–2004 period than prior to 1999, and they continued to drop in the post-MFA

period.
                                                                                                  31

       Table 5 also contains the results from the estimate of the male-female wage differential.

Columns 1 and 3 shows that the male-female wage gap throughout the economy in both

countries increased after the end of the MFA; this is consistent with the theoretic prediction that

a drop in the price of the female-intensive good should reduce the wages of women throughout

the economy. The change in the wage gap is very similar in the two countries.

       When we divide the MFA period into two segments, again using 1999 as a break point,

we see that the male-female wage gap closed considerably in Cambodia when the price of

apparel increased between 1999 and 2004 (column 2, table 5), and widened again when the price

of apparel dropped after 2004. In Sri Lanka, which did not experience the same dramatic change

in unit values, the gender wage gap demonstrates no significant difference in the 1999–2004

period. The gap does increase, however, after the end of the MFA when the unit value of apparel

dropped, as suggested by theory.

       The results presented in table 7 combine the short-run and long-run effects in one

empirical estimation. The results include interaction terms with both the T&G dummy and the

female dummy. The results described above still hold: the returns to working in the apparel

sector declined post-MFA in both countries and the male-female wage gap widened.

       The coefficient of the female dummy variable, which is capturing male-female wage

differentials, varies over time in both countries. This reflects changes in price of a specific

factor—female labor—over time. Furthermore, the results show that wages in T&G are generally

higher than economy-wide average wages. The changes in wages in T&G generally trace

changes in global apparel prices with a lag (figure 4). Importantly, the coefficients for age,

education, and hours worked were relatively stable over time in both countries.

       The point of the industrial policy employed by Cambodia and Sri Lanka (encouraging

T&G in particular) supports the policy prescriptions of the "old" Krueger and Summers

literature. In addition, they found that the differentials were constant, but we show that they are

correlated with industry prices (and are therefore not constant).


4.4. Labor Force Participation

       Suarè and Zoabi (2014) find that women adjust along the extensive margin in response to

labor demand shocks. To evaluate this possibility, we consider trends in women’s labor force

participation. Tables 10 and 11 report marginal effects (evaluated at the means of the regressors)

of the independent variables on labor force participation in Cambodia and Sri Lanka. The

likelihood of labor force participation for women is lower than that of men in both countries. The

female-male labor force participation differentials are higher in Sri Lanka than in Cambodia. For

example, while women were 9 percent less likely than men to participate in the labor force in

Cambodia in 2008, in Sri Lanka this differential was 23.2 percent in 2011. In general, in

Cambodia women were 9–10 percent less likely to participate in the labor force than men over

the 1996–2011 period. The gap slightly narrowed in 2007 (post-MFA) to 7.7 percent, but then

picked up to 12.6 percent in 2008. In Sri Lanka, the labor force participation of women was

about 20 percent lower than of men over the 1992–2002 period, but the difference increased to

28 percent in 2006 and remained around 22–23 percent between 2008 and 2012. Age and

education were associated with a higher probability of labor force participation in both countries.

On the other hand, married individuals were less likely to be economically active compared to

the never married group.

       Overall, the results show that women’s labor force participation is relatively constant

over time. This suggests that our results are not driven by adjustments along the extensive

margin or are not affected by unaccounted selection bias.


4.5. Hours

       Table 12 shows that from 1996 to 2011 substantial numbers of employees in Cambodia

worked more than 40 hours a week. A slightly higher percentage of women worked overtime

than men. The percentage of women working more than 40 hours a week increased post-MFA

from 68 percent in 2004 to 77 percent in 2011. The proportion fell to 69 percent in 2009. The

analysis shows that women who worked overtime on average worked 54 hours a week. There

was no significant difference between men and women. Furthermore, table 12 shows that 95

percent of textile and apparel workers worked more than 40 hours a day in 2011. This number

was significantly higher than the economy average of 75 percent. We also find that there was a

very small percentage of workers below 14 years old—on average less than one percent from

1996 to 2011. The percentage of workers in apparel younger than 14 years old was slightly

higher than the economy average, but lower than the agriculture average.

         Table 13 shows that on average in Sri Lanka a smaller percentage of people were

working more than 40 hours a week than in Cambodia—47 and 76 percent in 2008, respectively.

In Cambodia this share remained roughly the same from 2008 to 2012, while in Sri Lanka it went

up to 59 percent by 2012. There was a big difference between the share of men and women

working overtime in Sri Lanka—67 and 44 percent in 2012, respectively. Similar to Cambodia,

people who worked overtime worked on average 55 hours a week. Also, similar to Cambodia,

more people worked overtime in the apparel industry than in the economy overall—75 and 59

percent in 2012, respectively. The percentage of workers less than 14 years old in Sri Lanka is

lower than in Cambodia—0.08 and 0.74 percent in 2011, respectively. There were no workers

under 14 years old in the textile and apparel industry in 2012. Moreover, the percentage of girls
                                                                                                                                     42

and boys under 14 years working in Sri Lanka in 2012 was approximately the same—0.05 and

0.06 percent, respectively.

          Employment fluctuates with changes in labor demand, suggesting imperfect mobility

between industries. Working conditions fluctuate less over time, suggesting that our model

which focuses on wage changes in the context of imperfect labor mobility is not at odds with the

labor market characteristics of Cambodia and Sri Lanka.

          Table 14 shows the regression results using the hourly wages for both Cambodia and Sri

Lanka. The qualitative results are similar. The higher apparel prices in the MFA period are

characterized by higher industry-specific wage premiums and smaller male-female wage

differences. After the MFA, when apparel prices were lower, the apparel wage premiums are

lower and the male-female wage gap is larger. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
                                                                                                                 43

that changing apparel prices have general-equilibrium effects on the male-female wage

differential and on women’s wages throughout the economy (not just in apparel).

          Our results contribute in several ways to the debate surrounding the value of apparel

exports and employment for women in developing countries. First, we demonstrate that apparel

workers earn significant wage premiums relative to their other options in the economy.

Especially in Cambodia, these premiums increased significantly when Cambodia started

exporting apparel. Second, we show that women’s wages relative to men (the gender wage gap)
                                                                                                  44

follow changes in apparel prices in ways consistent with theory. Third, we show that changes in

apparel prices are not followed by significant changes in our measures of hours or adjustments

along the extensive margin for women.

        Our results also contribute to the broader debates surrounding trade and wages and the

effects of globalization on women. We demonstrate that a Heckscher-Ohlin approach which

differentiates males and females as separate factors may be a fruitful alternative to discrimination

models or those that analyze the effects of globalization on women in terms of skill. Under the

assumption that women comprise a more apparel-specific labor input than men and that the

apparel sector is a female-labor-intensive sector, the simple theoretical model predicts that a

negative price shock will translate into a relative decline in apparel wages compared to other

industries in the short run and a relative decrease in female wages compared to male wages

across all industries in the long run.

        The increased competition in apparel exports after the MFA phase-out drove down the

unit values of apparel both in Cambodia and Sri Lanka. The empirical results of the post-MFA

changes support the theoretical predictions. Workers, the majority of whom are female, in the

apparel industry were receiving a premium comparable to that of an average worker. This

premium decreased in both countries right after the MFA phase-out, but it slightly recovered in

the following years. Male-female wage differentials were declining under the MFA in both

countries. The gap, however, widened right after the MFA phase-out but later decreased. Finally,

in terms of a very narrow measurement of working conditions, we found that substantial

numbers of people were working more than 40 hours a week in apparel in both countries—95

percent in Cambodia in 2011 and 75 percent in Sri Lanka in 2012. On average, people working

overtime were working 55 hours a week. On the other hand, only 0.9 percent of apparel workers
                                                                                                45

in Cambodia were younger than 14 years and there were no apparel workers under 14 years in

Sri Lanka.

       The finding of significant apparel wage premiums that are linked to apparel prices

suggests economic opportunities for women in the formal labor market. Further research is

necessary to identify the potential development effects of such employment and to thoroughly

compare the benefits documented in this paper with the costs that may come with apparel jobs.

1   Galor and Weil (1996) illustrate the positive feedback of women’s labor force participation on development. Anderson and

Eswaran (2009) show that women’s employment apart from their husbands contributes to female autonomy. Duflo (2012) provides

an overview of the academic literature. The 2012 World Development Report, Gender Equality and Development, argues that

women’s economic empowerment in the form of gender equality “contributes to economic efficiency and the achievement of other

key development outcomes.” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated at the APEC Women and the Economy Summit

(September 16, 2011 at the Westin Saint Francis Hotel, San Francisco, California; see http://fpc.state.gov/172610.htm for the full

remarks) that “the increase in employment of women in developed countries during the past decade has added more to global

growth than China has.”
2 Previous   papers took very different approaches to the question of trade and gender inequality, but also found contrasting results.

The literature first built upon Becker’s (1971) discrimination model, which predicts that trade liberalization will increase

competition and reduce the employer’s ability to discriminate, leading to a smaller gender wage gap. Black and Brainerd (2004)

found that increased international trade in the United States led to falling gender wage gaps. Artecona and Cunningham (2002)

studied Mexico and found results consistent with Black and Brainerd (2004) but not statistically significant at conventional levels.

Berik et al. (2004), on the other hand, found evidence that increasing trade openness was associated with higher gender wage gaps

in Taiwan, China and the Republic of Korea between 1981 and 1999. Menon and Rodgers (2009) add to this pool of evidence,

finding that increasing openness to trade was associated with larger gender wage gaps in India’s concentrated manufacturing

industries between 1983 to 2004.
3   Most studies find little support for the assumption that females could be treated as unskilled workers (Domínguez-Villalobos and

Brown-Grossman 2010).

8The   goal of the MFA was to help industrialized countries adjust to the rising production capacity of developing countries. Under

this arrangement, textile and clothing quotas were negotiated bilaterally. On January 1, 1995, the MFA was replaced by the

Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), which brought the MFA under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). As

a transitional instrument, the ATC established a time frame to eliminate quotas and integrate clothing and textiles into the 1994
                                                                                                                                  53




rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). After the termination of the MFA in 1995 and the ATC in 2005,

trade in textile and clothing was no longer subject to quotas, and is governed now by general rules of the WTO and the GATT.
9   For example, in 2000 China’s market share of world apparel exports was 24.8 percent, Cambodia’s share was 0.6 percent, and

Mexico’s was 4.6 percent. In 2008, the Chinese market share of world apparel exports was 38.8 percent, an increase of 50 percent

as compared to 2004. The Cambodian market share doubled over the same time period and accounted for 1.2 percent of world

apparel exports. However, the Mexican share declined threefold in that period, and in 2008 it constituted only 1.4 percent of world

apparel exports (Lopez Acevedo and Robertson 2012).
10   The apparel wage premium is defined as the difference between the conditional mean wage in the economy and the conditional

mean wage in the apparel sector.
11   A common assumption for the productivity parameter is that it follows a Pareto distribution. The Pareto and the exponential

                                                                                                    x
distribution are closely related. If x has a Pareto distribution with a minimum of a then   y  log   .
                                                                                                    a
12   Juhn et al. (2014) allow for differences in technology to affect relative factor demands.
13   Consolidating the apparel industry in Sri Lanka meant concentrating apparel production in a smaller number of plants, mostly

the larger enterprises. This phenomenon was accompanied by a decrease in the number of small firms and overall employment.
14This   decline in Sri Lanka’s exports was related to lower demand in developed countries, but more importantly to the bomb attacks

at the Colombo International Airport in July 2001 that triggered the imposition of war-risk insurance charges (Kelegama and

Wijayasiri 2004). The reduction in orders and escalating insurance costs hit the industry severely, and as a result several small- and

medium-sized enterprises closed in the early 2000s.
15   Due to heterogeneity of textile and apparel products, there is no unique apparel or textile price. Following Harrigan and Barrows

(2009), we use derived unit values to proxy for output prices. The unit values are derived by dividing total value of apparel exports

by total volume of apparel exports.
16   The logarithm of wages is measured as the logarithm of real monthly individual labor income in 2005 prices.
17   The number of hours matters to explain earnings but it could be argued that this variable is endogenous. One approach is to use

the information on hours to compute labor earnings on an hourly basis. However, the hours data are particularly poor in our survey

data: many seem to be missing, and salaries are generally set as monthly earnings particularly in Cambodia.
18   Industry dummies include 15 categories: Agriculture and Forestry; Mining; Food, Beverage, and Tobacco; Textile and Apparel;

Wood; Other Manufacturing; Utilities; Construction; Sales; Transport; Financial, Insurance, and Real Estate; Public

Administration; Social Services; and Other Services. An omitted category is Agriculture and Forestry.
19   Occupation dummies are according to 1-digit ISCO-08; the omitted category is Managers.
                                                                                                                                 54



20   The possibility that the women choosing the T&G sector are different cannot be ruled out in principle, and deserves some

empirical consideration. One way to approach this would be to identify variables that would condition the selection into T&G do

not affect wages. Having siblings may be a good measure. We tried identifying the selection equation on siblings as a separate

exercise. However, this variable is not available in the data for either country.
21Several    papers split the sample (Blau et al. 2016) between male and females. This is the Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition that

separates the wage gap into observed and unobserved components. We are not concerned with the unobserved portions. Combining

the sample allows us to compare male and female wages directly before, during, and after the end of the MFA.

      22   Another important non-monetary dimension of a job that needs consideration is formality, such as benefits and type of

contract. Not everybody working in a formal firm is a formal worker, and these other non-monetary dimensions are important to

assess who is really better off. Unfortunately, our household surveys do not allow us to have more specific information on benefits

and type of contract beyond the measurements of working conditions described in the previous section.
23   The results present T&G relative to the "rest" using grand means. This makes the omitted category irrelevant, as it recalculates

all of the industry dummy variables as the difference between each industry's mean wage and the overall average wage in the

economy.
