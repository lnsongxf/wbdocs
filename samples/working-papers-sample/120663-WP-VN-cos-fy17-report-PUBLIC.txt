I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Vietnam perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Vietnam
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Vietnam
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From March to April 2017, 1478 stakeholders of the WBG in Vietnam were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
National Assembly Office/Committee; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs/community based organizations; the media; mass organizations; youth groups;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of
632 stakeholders participated in the survey (43% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via email. Other respondents
responded to the survey on an independent online survey platform. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Vietnam; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Vietnam; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (response rate was 49%, N=501). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’14 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 88).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined
       with those from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/community based
       organizations, mass organizations, and youth groups were combined in the “CSO”
       category; and the small number of respondents from the office of a minister, National
       Assembly Office, the judiciary branch, and other organizations were included in the
       “Other” category. There were no respondents from the Office of the President/Prime
       Minister.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY14 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’17 = 6.6; weighted mean in FY’14 = 6.7)1.
       Stakeholder difference: Respondents from ministries, PMUs, and consultants working
        on WBG projects were significantly more familiar with the WBG compared to
        respondents from other stakeholder groups this year.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Vietnam, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Vietnam, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Vietnam. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at energy; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at climate change.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Vietnam, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at climate change;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at natural resource management; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year18
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2017 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2014
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2014 COS report.

FY 2014 Number of comparable respondents = 480  FY 2017 Number of comparable respondents = 605

By weighting, the FY 2014 data is weighted against the FY 2017 data by using the question about stakeholders ‘current
position (H1), so that the two samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The office of the
president, prime minister, office of minister, the National Assembly, the judiciary branch are not included in the year
comparison analysis, because some of the groups have only one respondent, or they are represented in only one year. Please
note that the “other” group was not included in the comparison. The “national government” in the FY14 is re-named as
“employee of a ministry” for comparing with the corresponding group in FY17. The weighted stakeholder breakdown is
presented below:
