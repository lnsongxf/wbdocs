1       Introduction1
Developments in the U.S. economy, because of its size and international linkages, are bound
to have substantial implications for the global economy. The United States is the world’s
single largest economy (at market exchange rates), accounting for almost 22 percent of global
output and over a third of stock market capitalization. It is prominent in virtually every
global market, accounting for about one-tenth of global trade ﬂows, one-ﬁfth of global FDI
stock, close to one-ﬁfth of remittances, and one-ﬁfth of global energy demand. Since the U.S.
dollar is the most widely used currency in global trade and ﬁnancial transactions, changes
in U.S. monetary policy and investor sentiment play a major role in driving global ﬁnancing
conditions.

   At the same time, the global economy is important for the United States. Aﬃliates of
U.S. multinationals operating abroad and aﬃliates of foreign companies located in the United
States account for a sizable share of output, employment, cross-border trade and ﬁnancial
ﬂows. One-sixth of consumer goods purchases by U.S. consumers are for imported goods,
with an even higher share in cars and consumer electronics.

   While there is an extensive body of work that examines diﬀerent aspects of the role of
the U.S. economy and the global spillovers it generates, the literature lacks an integrated
and comprehensive overview on this important topic.2 The paper ﬁlls this gap in the liter-
ature by providing an overview of the role of the United States in the global economy and
quantifying the global spillovers from changes in U.S. growth, monetary and ﬁscal policies,
and uncertainty in its ﬁnancial markets and economic policies. Speciﬁcally, the paper ad-
dresses four major questions. First, how important are economic linkages between the U.S.
economy and the world? Second, how synchronous are business cycles in the United States
and other economies? Third, how large are global spillovers from shocks originating in the
United States? Finally, how important is the global economy for the United States?

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 examines the economic linkages
between the United States and the world economy focusing on trade, ﬁnancial and commodity
markets; Section 3 explores the synchronization of U.S. and global business and ﬁnancial
cycles; Section 4 quantiﬁes the extent to which changes in U.S. growth spill over to the global

    Some studies focus on the magnitude of real and ﬁnancial spillovers from the United States and other
advanced economies (World Bank 2016a; IMF 2015a and IMF 2015b; Arteta et al. 2015). Shambaugh (2016)
examines the importance of global growth for the U.S. economy.

Section 5 discusses potential channels of spillovers to the United States from the global
economy; and ﬁnally, Section 6 concludes.


2       Linkages between the United States and the World
With an estimated nominal GDP of more than $18 trillion in 2016, the United States is the
world’s single largest economy and has the world’s third largest population. It accounts for
more than 25 percent of global GDP (at 2015 market exchange rates), 11 percent of global
trade, 12 percent of bank foreign claims, and 35 percent of global stock market capitalization
(Figures 1 and 2).3 The U.S. share of global output and trade has remained broadly stable
since the 1980s, whereas the share of other major advanced economies has declined gradually.
The United States is the single largest international creditor and debtor: it holds the largest
stock of foreign assets and liabilities and, by a wide margin, the largest net foreign asset
position.

    U.S. trade and ﬁnancial integration with other advanced economies and EMDEs—especially
in Latin America and the Caribbean (Figure 3)—runs deep. Countries whose trade and ﬁnan-
cial ties are predominantly with the United States are directly exposed to U.S. developments.
In addition, those that are in general highly open to global trade and ﬁnance are indirectly
exposed because of widespread spillovers from the United States.

2.1     Trade links
Trade accounted for 28 percent of U.S. GDP in 2015, considerably less than the average for
other advanced economies (70 percent) but signiﬁcantly larger than in the 1980s (18 percent).
The United States is the world’s single largest importer and exporter of goods and services,
and the largest exporter and importer of business services (Figure 4). It accounts for 14
percent of global goods imports and 9 percent of global services imports.

    Manufactured goods account for more than three-quarters of U.S. goods imports, with
oil imports making up most of the remainder despite a steady decline since 2000. The most
prominent imported manufacturing categories are motor vehicles, data processing machines,
and drugs. More than two-thirds of U.S. manufacturing imports originate from China (24

   At Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates, the United States is the world’s second largest economy with
about 16 percent of global GDP in 2015. China is the world’s largest, accounting for 17 percent of global
GDP.

A. Foreign claims are consolidated foreign claims of BIS-reporting banks headquartered in respective
countries or locations (data unavailable for China). Assets and liabilities are international investment
positions. Average share for 2010-15, except for assets and liabilities (2010-14).
B. Total is the sum of assets and liabilities. Average shares in GDP over the periods of 1980-89 and 2010-14.
C. For currency, totals sum to 100 percent because each foreign exchange transaction involves two diﬀerent
currencies. "Euro" includes all legacy currencies of the Euro as well as the European Currency Unit. Data
for the center and right bars are for June 2016.
D. Capital investment refers to stocks of foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment, and
cross-border bank lending from the United States to EMDE regions. Country coverage varies by capital
investment component. As FDI data are not available for 2015, data up to 2014 are used for FDI.
percent of imports), the European Union (20 percent of imports), Mexico and Canada (com-
bined 24 percent of imports).

   The United States is the single largest export destination for one-ﬁfth of the world’s
countries. It is the largest export market for more than half of the EMDEs in Latin America
and the Caribbean, and South Asia, and the primary export market for several countries in
other EMDE regions, especially in East Asia Paciﬁc. Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and many
smaller Central American EMDEs rely particularly heavily on exports to the United States.

    The growth of trade linkages between the United States and other countries has taken
place in an era of trade liberalization. Since 1948, the General Agreement on Trade and
Tariﬀs (GATT) and, since 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) have provided a
multilateral framework for this process. The majority of U.S. trade is conducted under
the Most Favored Nation (MFN) regime, with average tariﬀs at 3.5 percent (5.2 percent
for agricultural products). In addition to multilateral agreements, the United States has
negotiated 14 bilateral or regional trade agreements with 20 partner countries, which cover
32 percent of its imports of goods and services.4 The largest of these agreements is the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), in force since 1994. The United States
also grants unilateral preferences to a number of EMDEs through it Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP) and African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA) which cover about 3.3
percent of U.S. imports (Frazer and Biesebroek 2010; Mattoo, Roy, and Subramaniam 2003).

2.2    Financial links
The U.S. ﬁnancial markets are highly integrated with global markets. Following a rapid
expansion over three decades, by 2010-14, its international assets and liabilities were on
average three times GDP, broadly in line with that of other advanced economies (Figure
2). The United States remains the world’s largest source and recipient of foreign direct
investment (FDI) ﬂows, accounting for about one-fourth of world FDI inﬂows and outﬂows
in 2015. The European Union (EU), Japan, Canada and Switzerland together hold about
90 percent of FDI assets in the United States, while the EU and Canada are the largest
recipients of U.S. FDI. The countries of the Latin America and Caribbean region are the
most exposed to FDI inﬂows originating in the United States, in particular, Brazil, Chile,
and Mexico (Figure 5). Reﬂecting the size and depth of its ﬁnancial markets, the United
States accounts for the largest share of portfolio assets in one-third of EMDEs.

    The U.S. dollar is the most widely used currency in international trade and ﬁnancial
markets and is the world’s preeminent reserve currency. Around 80 percent of EMDE bond
issuance and more than 50 percent of cross-border bank ﬂows to EMDEs are denominated
in U.S. dollars. Europe and Central Asia is the only EMDE region where the U.S. dollar
is surpassed—by the euro—as the currency of denomination for cross-border bank ﬂows.
Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama use the U.S. dollar as their oﬃcial currency; more than
30 other EMDEs maintain exchange rate pegs against the U.S. dollar. A large share of
oﬃcial foreign exchange reserves (63 percent) are dollar-denominated. The U.S. dollar is
widely used in international trade transactions for current account transactions, accounting
for about one-third of invoicing for goods and services in Europe and two-thirds in Asia
(Goldberg and Tille 2008, 2016; Devereux and Shi 2013).

2.3    Commodity market links
The United States is a large producer and consumer of commodities (Figure 6). For example,
it has re-emerged as the largest producer of oil and natural gas in recent years, accounting for
13 percent of global oil production (similar to its share in the early 1990s). U.S. production
is almost evenly split between natural gas and petroleum, in contrast to the predominantly
petroleum-based production of other major hydrocarbon producers such as Russia and Saudi
Arabia (EIA 2016). U.S. shale oil production, which tripled during 2009-14, requires little
capital investment and can be brought onstream rapidly; hence, it has become a highly
ﬂexible source of global oil supply, responding quickly to price changes (Baﬀes et al. 2016).

    The United States is also the world’s largest biofuel producer, accounting for 42 percent
of global production. Rapid growth in maize-based production was encouraged by the Re-
newable Fuel Standard (RFS), mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007, which requires transportation fuel sold in the United
States to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels.

    Historically, the United States has been a major consumer of agricultural, energy, and
metal commodities. With the rise of large EMDEs, such as China and India, this role has
diminished over time (World Bank 2015a). However, the United States is still the largest
consumer of natural gas and oil, accounting for more than one-ﬁfth of global consumption. It
is the second largest consumer of a wide range of commodities, including aluminum, copper,
lead, and coﬀee.

A.B. Data for metals represent reﬁned consumption and production. Iron ore consumption is estimated
with crude steel production. Grains include wheat, maize and rice; edible oils include coconut oil,
cottonseed oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil and soybean oil. Oil includes inland
demand plus international aviation and marine bunkers and reﬁnery fuel and loss. Coal includes
commercial solid fuels only, i.e., bituminous coal, anthracite, lignite and brown coal, and other commercial
solid fuels. Natural gas excludes natural gas converted to liquid fuels but includes derivatives of coal as well
as natural gas consumed in gas-to-liquids transformation.
D. Oil and natural gas production in British thermal units (Btu), assuming that 1 barrel of crude oil is
equivalent to 5,729,000 Btu and 1 cubic foot of natural gas is equivalent to 1,032 Btu.
3       Synchronization of U.S. and global cycles
3.1     Synchronization of business cycles
Business cycles in the United States, other advanced economies and EMDEs have been highly
synchronous (Figure 7). This is partly a reﬂection of the strength of global trade and ﬁnancial
linkages of the U.S. economy with the rest of the world. In addition, it is also a reﬂection of
global shocks that had a common eﬀect on many countries at the same time. Business cycles
in the United States are somewhat more correlated with those in other advanced economies
than those in EMDEs (with the important exception of Mexico) because of deeper economic
integration.

3.2     Concordance of cyclical turning points
International business cycle synchronization tends to be particularly strong when the U.S.
economy is in recession but, over the phases of the U.S. business cycle, GDP growth in the
rest of the world correlates with the U.S. cycle substantially. For example, growth was on
average higher in other advanced economies and EMDEs during periods of U.S. expansions
than it was when the U.S. economy was in recession. More importantly, although the four
recessions the global economy experienced since 1960 (1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009) were
driven by a host of problems in many corners of the world, they all overlapped with severe
recessions in the United States.5
    The global recession of 1975 coincided with the beginning of a prolonged period of stagﬂa-
tion, with low output growth and high inﬂation in the United States. During the 1982 reces-
sion, the United States and several other advanced economies experienced a sharp decline in
activity along with a steep increase in unemployment in the wake of anti-inﬂationary mon-
etary policies. The economy again went into recession in July 1990 following a period of
depressed activity in the housing market and a credit crunch. The deep global recession of
2009 was driven by the global ﬁnancial crisis, which had its origins in the U.S. mortgage mar-
ket but turned into a truly global crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September
2008. These four U.S. recessions coincided with global recessions; there were, however, four
other U.S. recessions post-1960 that did not.
   An event study of the last two U.S. recessions, in 2001 and 2009, illustrates the concor-
dance of the turning points of the U.S. business cycle with those of other advanced economies

    5
    Global recessions are contractions in inﬂation-adjusted output per capita accompanied by broad, syn-
chronized declines in various other measures, such as world industrial production, employment, trade and
capital ﬂows, and energy consumption (Kose and Terrones 2015).

E.F. The graph shows cyclical component of GDP measured as the deviation from trend GDP computed
using a Hodrick-Prescott ﬁlter on seasonally adjusted quarterly GDP around a trough in U.S. business cycle
(t = 0) indicated by the solid bar. Troughs are 2001Q4 and 2009 Q2, deﬁned by the National Bureau of
Economic Research. The line refers to median of 35 advanced economies and 51 EMDEs.
and EMDEs (Figure 7).6 The 2009 recession was particularly severe for the United States
whereas the U.S. economy experienced a mild recession in 2001 following the burst of the
"dot com" bubble of the late 1990s. In the four quarters leading up to the last two U.S.
business cycle troughs, other advanced economies also experienced a decline in the cyclical
component of their GDP of, respectively, 0.5 and 4 percent, while their subsequent recoveries
have been sluggish. Among EMDEs, slower activity was also observed around these two
cyclical troughs.

    Concordance statistics illustrate the degree of synchronization between the phases of the
U.S. business and ﬁnancial cycles and those of other economies. Business cycles are more
highly synchronized than ﬁnancial cycles: other countries tend to be in the same business
cycle phase (speciﬁcally, troughs, peaks, expansions and downturns) with the U.S. cycle
roughly 80 percent of the time. While the degree of synchronization of ﬁnancial cycles with
the U.S. ﬁnancial cycle is lower than that of business cycles, they are quite often in the same
phase—about sixty percent of the time for credit, housing, and equity price cycles (Figure
7). While it is diﬃcult to establish empirically whether the U.S. economy leads business and
ﬁnancial cycle turning points in other major economies, recent research indicates that the
United States appears to inﬂuence the timing and duration of recessions in a number of other
major economies (Francis et al. 2015).


4       Spillovers from the United States to the global economy
Developments in the U.S. economy have signiﬁcant impacts on the global economy. Shocks
to the U.S. economy transmit to the rest of the world through the range of channels discussed
above. An acceleration in U.S. activity can lift growth in its trading partners directly, through
an increase in import demand, and indirectly, by strengthening productivity spillovers em-
bedded in trade.7 Given its sizable role in global commodity markets, an acceleration in
U.S. activity tends to lift global commodity demand and raise prices. This supports activity
and eases balance of payments pressures in commodity exporters. Financial market devel-
opments in the United States may have even wider global implications. Changes in U.S.
policies could therefore be expected to aﬀect domestic activity and generate wide-ranging
cross-border spillovers through real and ﬁnancial channels.

   Two U.S. business cycle peaks (March 2001 and December 2007) and two U.S. business cycle troughs
(November 2001 and June 2009) are identiﬁed since 2000 by the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee.

countries, see Dées and Vansteenkiste (2007); Stock and Watson (2005); Kose (2003); Kose, Prasad, and
Terrones (2004); Jansen and Stokman (2004); Eickmeier (2007); IMF (2007); and Roache (2008).

   Independently of growth, policy, or ﬁnancial market developments in the United States,
shocks to conﬁdence of U.S. businesses and consumers can themselves reverberate across
borders and be sources of business cycle ﬂuctuations (Levchenko and Pandalai-Nayar 2015).
Elevated uncertainty about changes in U.S. policies can reduce incentives to commit to capital
investment at home and abroad, and this in turn could adversely aﬀect long-term global
growth prospects (Kose and Terrones 2015).

4.1    Growth spillovers
U.S. growth shocks are expected to have sizable eﬀects on activity in the rest of the world.
Our estimates show that a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. growth could lift growth in
advanced economies by 0.8 percentage point and in EMDEs by 0.6 percentage points after
one year, while global growth (excluding the United States) could rise by 0.7 percentage point
(Figure 8).8 Growth spillovers reported here are based on a Bayesian vector autoregression
model with Cholesky ordering based on a sample that covers other AEs includes such as
the Euro Area (19 countries), Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom and 19 EMDEs for
1998Q1-2016Q2. The model includes growth in the United States, other advanced economies,
EMDEs and the rest of the world, as well as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields and emerging market
bond spreads (World Bank 2016a; World Bank 2017).

   The impact of U.S. growth shocks on investment in these economies would be approx-
imately twice as large. NAFTA members (Canada and Mexico) would particularly beneﬁt
from trade spillovers (Yifan and Abeysinghe 2016). Terms of trade eﬀects through commodity
markets would be another transmission channel (World Bank 2016b).

4.2    Financial market spillovers
The role of the United States in global ﬁnancial markets goes well beyond direct capital
ﬂows to and from the United States.9 U.S. bond and equity markets are the largest and
most liquid in the world. Swings in U.S. sovereign bond yields are often closely mirrored in
other large ﬁnancial markets. Similarly, cross-border spillovers from U.S. equity markets are
signiﬁcant and depend more on openness to the global economy than on the size of actual

  8
    This estimate for advanced economies is in line with other estimates for Canada (Swiston and Bayoumi
2008). For Mexico and Caribbean economies with strong economic ties to the United States, considerably
larger spillovers in excess of 1 percentage point have been estimated (Sun and Samuel 2009; Swiston and
Bayoumi 2008).

bilateral portfolio ﬂows (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon 2011; Rose and Spiegel 2011).
This makes U.S. monetary policy and investor conﬁdence important drivers of global ﬁnancial
conditions (Ehrmann and Fratzscher 2009; Arteta et al. 2015; Rey 2015).

    Because of its predominant use in global trade and ﬁnancial transactions, broad-based U.S.
dollar exchange rate movements have global implications. Episodes of U.S. dollar appreciation
tend to coincide with bank deleveraging, tighter global ﬁnancial conditions, greater incidence
of ﬁnancial crises and subdued EMDE growth.10 Although the share of private and public
debt denominated in foreign currency has declined since the 1990s, the exposure of some
EMDEs to foreign currency movements is still high, especially in commodity exporters, as
well as importers that have received large capital inﬂows after the global ﬁnancial crisis
(Arteta et al. 2016). If the U.S. dollar goes through a period of signiﬁcant appreciation,

previous experience indicates that EMDEs with substantial short-term dollar-denominated
debt could become vulnerable to rollover and interest rate risks and to a drying up of foreign
exchange liquidity.11

4.3       Monetary policy spillovers
Changes in U.S. monetary policy have sizable cross-border eﬀects through their impact on
domestic activity and global ﬁnancial markets, including currency and asset markets. In the
aftermath of the global ﬁnancial crisis, highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced
countries have coincided with an acceleration in capital inﬂows to EMDEs. In turn, higher
U.S. interest rates could reduce such ﬂows, especially those intermediated by banks, and push
up global interest rates.12

    Although actual or expected changes in U.S. monetary policy have signiﬁcant impacts
on U.S. and global long-term yields, the implications for EMDEs would likely depend on
underlying drivers. A panel vector autoregression model is used to analyze the diﬀerentiated
eﬀects on EMDEs of “real” and “monetary” shocks driving U.S. long-term bond yields (Arteta
et al. 2015).13 The model includes EMDE industrial production, long-term bond yields, stock
prices, nominal eﬀective exchange rates and bilateral exchange rates against the U.S. dollar,
and inﬂation. Monetary and real shocks are considered exogenous regressors.

    Results show that if a rise in long-term U.S. yields is supported by prospects of a strength-
ening U.S. economy (a favorable "real shock"), the net eﬀect for EMDEs could be positive
(Figure 9). In particular, it could bolster equity valuations and activity, and lead to less pro-
nounced currency pressures. Alternatively, if ﬁnancial markets are surprised by prospects of
a less accommodative stance of U.S. monetary policy, one that is not supported by strength-
ening growth, this could have adverse consequences for EMDEs through asset price and
capital ﬂow channels (an adverse "monetary shock"). Financial stress associated with such
a change could combine with domestic fragilities and increase the risks of sudden stops in
capital inﬂows to more vulnerable EMDEs.

    An adverse monetary shock is assumed to increase long term yields and reduce stock prices in the United
States, while a favorable real shock is assumed to increase both long-term yields and stock prices in the
United States. The decomposition is derived from a structural vector autoregression with sign restrictions
(Arteta et al. 2015).

A.B.C. Impulse responses were derived in two steps. First, “real” and “monetary” shocks are identiﬁed using
a structural vector autoregression with sign restrictions, assuming that an adverse U.S. monetary shock
increases long-term yields and reduces stock prices in the United States, while a favorable U.S. real shock
increases both yields and stock prices. Second, “real” and “monetary” shocks are included as exogenous
regressors in a separate vector autoregression model including EMDE industrial production, long-term bond
yields, stock prices, nominal eﬀective exchange rates and bilateral exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.
Based on a sample of 23 EMDEs and estimated over the period January 2013-September 2015.
D. Figure shows the impulse response of capital inﬂows to 64 EMDEs, according to a six-dimensional vector
regression model linking capital inﬂows (including foreign direct investment, portfolio investment and other
investment as a share of GDP), to quarterly real GDP growth in both EMDE and G4 countries (United
States, Euro Area, Japan and the United Kingdom), real G4 short-term interest rates (three-month money
market rates minus annual inﬂation measured as changes in GDP deﬂator), G4 term spread (10-year
government bond yields minus three month money market rates), and the VIX index of implied volatility of
U.S. SP 500 options. The 100 basis point shock on the U.S. term spread was applied to the model assuming
a range of pass-through rates to Euro Area, U.K. and Japanese bond yields, from zero to 100 percent. Grey
area shows the range of estimated eﬀects on capital inﬂows depending on pass-through rates (the lower
bound corresponds to a zero pass-through rate implying a 40 basis points shock to global bond yields, while
the upper bound corresponds to a 100 percent pass-through rates, or a 100 basis points shock to global
bond yields). In the median case, global bond yields increase initially by 70 basis points.
     The ultimate impact on capital ﬂows of unexpected U.S. monetary policy tightening (be-
yond one warranted by strengthening U.S. activity) would also depend on the reaction of
long-term yields in other major advanced economies, and in particular how market partici-
pants reassess monetary policy expectations in these economies. Eﬀects would be ampliﬁed
if it coincided with synchronized increases in long term yields across G4 economies (United
States, Euro Area, Japan, and the United Kingdom), but would be dampened if long term
yields only increase in the United States.

   A 100 basis point increase in long-term U.S. bond yields could reduce capital ﬂows to
EMDEs by 20-45 percent, with the upper bound of this range reﬂecting simultaneous in-
creases in long term yields across G4 economies. These results are derived from a vector
autoregression model including capital ﬂows to EMDEs (foreign direct investment, portfolio
investment, and other investment as a share of GDP), quarterly real GDP growth in EMDEs
and G4 countries, real G4 short-term interest rates, G4 term spread, and the VIX index of
implied volatility of U.S. S&P 500 options (Arteta et al. 2015).

4.4    Fiscal policy spillovers
Changes in U.S. ﬁscal policy could generate international spillovers by aﬀecting U.S. demand
for imports from abroad, by causing exchange rate movements or by inﬂuencing international
borrowing conditions. Simulations using the Federal Reserve Board’s model (FRB/US) sug-
gest that a ﬁscal stimulus of 1 percent of GDP could be expected to raise U.S. growth by
between 0.7 and 1.5 percent after two years (World Bank 2017; Brayton, Laubach and Reif-
schneider 2014). However, the eﬀectiveness of ﬁscal stimulus in lifting U.S. growth over the
short and medium run depends critically on the circumstances of its implementation.

   Fiscal multipliers—the additional output generated by an additional U.S. dollar of gov-
ernment spending or tax cut—depend on the presence of economic slack, the reaction of
monetary policy, and the nature of the ﬁscal measures (Laforte and Roberts 2014; Brayton,
Laubach, and Reifschneider 2014; Whalen and Reichling 2015). In particular, ﬁscal stimulus
measures could be expected to have diﬀerent eﬀects if they take the form of tax cuts or
measures to bolster government spending and infrastructure investment.

   The short-term ﬁscal multiplier associated with corporate tax cuts is generally estimated
to be below one, although considerable uncertainty surrounds these estimates (Chahrour,
Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe 2012; Ljungqvist and Smolyansky 2016; Whalen and Reichling
2015). Regarding personal income tax cuts, empirical studies ﬁnd that ﬁscal multipliers vary
considerably, from 0.3 and 1.5 (Whalen and Reichling 2015). The eﬀect on growth depends


                                            18
notably on the structure of the tax cuts and as well as the way in which they are ﬁnanced
(Gale and Samwick 2016; Zidar 2015).

    Public infrastructure spending is generally estimated to have larger short-term eﬀects on
U.S. activity, with ﬁscal multiplier comprised between 0.4 and 2.2 (Auerbach and Gorod-
nichenko 2012; Bivens 2014; Whalen and Reichling 2015). This reﬂects the direct impact
of public investment on aggregate demand, a relatively low import content of infrastructure
spending and positive eﬀects on private investment and productivity.

    Fiscal loosening in the United States could have positive cross-border spillover eﬀects,
raising U.S. demand for trading partners’ exports and hence leading to faster global growth
in the near-term. However, some factors could mitigate these positive eﬀects, including oﬀset-
ting cuts in government spending and ﬂuctuations in exchange rate and ﬁnancing conditions.

    Further dollar appreciation associated with ﬁscal stimulus measures in the United States
could trigger ﬁnancial stability concerns in economies with elevated U.S.-dollar denominated
liabilities. Empirical evidence of the impact of U.S. ﬁscal policy on the strength of the U.S.
dollar is mixed, however.14 If U.S. ﬁscal stimulus leads to a higher level of U.S. public debt
in the long-term, this could also cause an increase in global interest rates and be a source of
adverse cross-border spillovers through tightening ﬁnancial conditions (Cardarelli and Kose
2004).

4.5     Uncertainty spillovers
Increased uncertainty driven by ﬁnancial market volatility or ambiguity about the direction
and scope of policies could discourage investors in the United States and elsewhere that base
their decisions about long-term investments on stable ﬁnancing conditions and predictable
policies. Sustained increases in ﬁnancial market uncertainty, e.g., as captured in the implied
volatility of the U.S. stock market (VIX), could set back output and investment growth in
the United States, other advanced economies and EMDEs (Carriére-Swallow and Céspedes
2013; Bloom 2009). In particular, a 10 percent increase in the VIX could reduce average
EMDE output growth by about 0.2 percentage point and EMDE investment growth by
about 0.6 percentage point after one year (Figure 10). These estimates are based on a vector
autoregression model including the VIX index, emerging market equity prices, emerging
market bond spreads, and GDP and investment growth in 18 EMDEs (World Bank 2017).
The impact on other advanced economies would be broadly comparable.

Note: Figures reﬂect cumulative impulse responses after one year on output and investment growth in the
United States, 23 other AEs, and 18 EMDEs to a 10-percent increase in the VIX and U.S. EPU. Vector
autoregressions were estimated for 1998Q1-2016Q2 with two lags. The model for the U.S. includes, in this
order, uncertainty index (VIX or U.S. EPU), U.S. stock price index (SP 500), U.S. 10-year bond yields,
U.S. real GDP, and investment growth. The model for AEs includes uncertainty indexes (VIX or U.S.
EPU), MSCI Index for advanced economies (MXGS), U.S. 10-year bond yields, aggregate real output, and
investment growth in 23 other AEs. The model for EMDEs includes uncertainty indexes (VIX or U.S.
EPU), the MSCI emerging market equity price index, J.P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBIG),
aggregate real output and investment growth in 18 EMDEs. G7 real GDP growth, U.S. 10-year bond
yields, and the MSCI world equity price index are added as exogenous regressors.
    Financial market volatility does not necessarily coincide with policy uncertainty, yet both
appear to be detrimental to investment. Policy uncertainty is measured by the Economic
Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU), a news-based measure of policy uncertainty (Baker, Bloom
and Davies 2015). A sustained 10 percent increase in the index of U.S. EPU could, after
one year, reduce U.S. output growth by about 0.15 percentage point, EMDE output growth
by 0.2 percentage point, and EMDE investment growth by 0.6 percentage point (Figure 10).
Similar to the results presented above, these estimates are based on vector autoregression
models including the U.S. EPU, equity prices, bond yields, and GDP and investment growth
in the respective economies for 18 EMDEs for 1998Q1-2016Q2 (World Bank 2017).


5     Spillovers to the United States from the global economy
Important as the U.S. economy is to the global economy, the U.S. economy is also aﬀected by
the strength of its linkages with the rest of the world (Figure 11). Moreover, global economic
and ﬁnancial developments play an important role in driving activity and ﬁnancial markets
in the United States.

5.1    Global trade
In 2015, trade accounted for more than one-quarter of U.S. GDP (28 percent) and manufac-
turing output for slightly more than one-ﬁfth (22 percent) of GDP. Most U.S. goods exports
are manufacturing goods (87 percent of U.S. goods exports), followed by agricultural prod-
ucts (4 percent) and oil, gas and minerals (2 percent). The most prominent goods export
categories are petroleum oils (other than crude), motor vehicles and their parts, and elec-
tronic parts. Most U.S. goods and services exports are shipped to Canada, the EU, Mexico,
and China, which altogether account for more than 60 percent of total U.S. exports. Export-
intensive industries in the United States have tended to be more productive and oﬀered
higher wages than non-export-intensive industries: during 1989-2009, on average, their total
factor productivity growth was 51 percent higher; labor productivity was 10 percent higher;
and wages were 17 percent higher (Council of Economic Advisors 2015).

5.2    Global value chain participation
Many U.S. companies are deeply integrated into global supply chains. As a result, U.S. ex-
ports themselves are often an input into other countries’ production for exports ("forward
participation"). One-quarter of U.S. exports represents U.S. value added embodied in other
countries’ exports. Such forward participation is particularly high in chemicals, business
services, and electronics, and with China, Canada, and Mexico. "Backward participation" is

                                              21
more limited: the average import content of U.S. exports was 13 percent in 2014, well below
the average for other advanced economies (27 percent). However, in some U.S. industries,
imports account for more than 20 percent of inputs. These include apparel and leather prod-
ucts, motor vehicles, and computers and electronics (U.S. International Trade Commission
2011). Imports are often essential components that do not have readily available domestic
substitutes.

5.3    Multinational corporations
Much global value chain activity is conducted through U.S. multinational corporations and
their aﬃliates abroad. Although U.S. multinationals account for less than 1 percent of the
total number of U.S. ﬁrms, since 1990, they accounted for one-third of U.S. real GDP growth
and almost half of U.S. labor productivity growth (McKinsey Global Institute 2010). As
part of global supply chains, U.S. multinationals rely heavily on exports and imports; in fact,
the largest U.S. exporters are multinationals (Moran and Oldenski 2016). Multinationals’
presence in ﬁnancial markets is large; for example, they account for about 85 percent of the
stock market capitalization of the S&P500.

    About 43 percent of total U.S. trade occurs within multinational ﬁrms (intra-ﬁrm trade),
especially in the case of U.S. trade with advanced economies. Since the global ﬁnancial
crisis, intra-ﬁrm trade has continued to grow robustly (especially with EMDEs) whereas
arm’s-length trade has slowed sharply. Access to foreign markets has also beneﬁted domes-
tic U.S. activity. For example, a 10 percent increase in foreign direct investment by U.S.
multinationals abroad was accompanied by 2.6 percent greater domestic investment in the
United States (Desai, Foley, and Hines 2009). In turn, foreign multinationals operating in
the United States provided 10 percent of U.S. employment and 19 percent of U.S. exports,
on average, during 2010-13 (Figure 11).

5.4    Global ﬁnance
Financial linkages between the United States and the rest of the world, including emerging
market economies, have grown rapidly over the past decade, potentially leading to two-way
spillovers. Financial market stress or sharp growth slowdowns in the rest of the world can
put pressure on the U.S. ﬁnancial system (IMF 2013; 2014). For example, ﬁnancial stress
that raises risk premia and widens output gaps by 1 percent in some major economies, could
widen the U.S. output gap by 0.1-0.35 percent (IMF 2013).

   A signiﬁcant appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which could be driven by increasingly diver-
gent monetary policies with other reserve currencies, weakening growth prospects in the rest

                                              22
of the world, or relatively sizable ﬁscal stimulus in the United States, could have a negative
impact on U.S. growth as well. For example, a 10 percent appreciation of the trade-weighted
U.S. dollar, could reduce U.S. GDP from baseline by over 1 percent after three years, as-
suming no change in monetary policy (Fischer 2015). The adverse eﬀect would materialize
only gradually, with over half of the impact occurring after more than a year. Monetary
policy accommodation could substantially ease the impact of a strengthening dollar to about
one-half to two-thirds of its direct trade eﬀect.15

5.5        Consumer and labor markets
About one-third of U.S. consumer spending is on goods, of which about one-sixth is on
imported goods. The share of imports in consumption expenditures is larger for durable
goods (29 percent)—especially durable household equipment, motor vehicles, and recreational
goods—and clothing and footwear (32 percent). The United States hosts the world’s largest
number of immigrants (Chandy and Seidel 2016). Immigrants accounted for 17 percent of
the U.S. civilian labor force, on average, in 2015, and more than one-quarter in some parts
of the United States. Immigrants originate from all over the world, but mainly from Mexico,
China, and India.16

5.6        Spillovers from the world to the United States
Because of strengthening multidimensional linkages between the United States and the rest
of the world, U.S. business cycles are highly synchronized with the global business cycle.
Global developments account for a sizable fraction of variation in business cycles in the
United States. According to a dynamic factor model estimated over the period 1985-2015,
close to 40 percent of the variance of U.S. growth can be attributable to a global factor
(Figure 11; Hirata, Kose, and Otrok 2013; World Bank 2016a).

    In addition, growth shocks originating in other economies, especially in other advanced
economies, have a signiﬁcant impact on activity in the United States (Bems, Johnson, and
Yi 2010).17 A vector autoregression model including GDP or industrial production growth
in the United States, other advanced economies and EMDEs, as well as 10-year U.S. bond

  15
    See Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust (2006); Laforte and Roberts (2014); Brayton, Laubach, and Reifschneider
(2014).
  16
     Immigration generally appears to raise aggregate wages and lower prices as well as stimulate investment
and innovation (Peri 2010; Greenstone and Looney 2012; Hunt and Gaultier-Loiselle 2010; Chellaraj, Maskus
and Mattoo 2008).
  17
       Some recent studies examine the impact of shocks originating in other countries on activity in the United

consists of goods and services.
B. Share of multinational corporations in U.S. sales, exports and imports of goods and employment.
"Sales" indicates sales of multinational corporations in gross output of U.S. private sector industries. Data
covers 2010-2013.
C. The ﬁgure reﬂects the contribution of global, group-speciﬁc, and other factors to the variance of GDP
growth. A dynamic factor model is estimated over the period 1985-2015, using a sample of 106 countries
grouped into three regions: advanced economies (AEs), emerging and frontier markets, and other
developing countries. Variance decompositions are computed for each country and, within each country, for
output. Each bar represents the variance share of U.S. and G6 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) output growth attributable to the global factor, the
AE-speciﬁc factor, the country-speciﬁc factor and the idiosyncratic term.
D. The ﬁgure shows cumulative impulse responses after one year of GDP or industrial production (IP)
growth in the United States following a 1 percentage point increase in GDP or industrial production growth
in 22 other AEs and 19 EMDEs (13 EMDEs for industrial production). "Global" indicates the weighted
average impact of AEs and EMDEs. Vertical lines indicate 16th-84th percentile conﬁdence bands. Vector
autoregression models are estimated for 1998Q1-2016Q2 with four lags. The model includes, in this order,
global GDP or industrial production growth excluding the United States and AE or EMDE, U.S. GDP or
industrial production growth, the U.S. 10-year sovereign bond yield plus JP Morgan’s EMBI index and AE
or EMDE GDP or industrial production growth. The oil price is assumed to be exogenous.
yields and emerging market bond spreads, points to particularly signiﬁcant eﬀects of external
growth shocks on industrial activity in the United States (World Bank 2017). Furthermore,
investment in the United States is increasingly aﬀected by global conditions (Shambaugh
2016).


6     Conclusion
The objective of this paper is to ﬁll a gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive
overview of the role of the United States in the global economy and quantifying the extent
of the global spillovers from changes in U.S. growth, monetary and ﬁscal policies, and un-
certainty in its ﬁnancial markets and economic policies. Speciﬁcally, the paper addresses the
following questions:

    What are the major channels of transmission of developments in the U.S. economy to
other countries? The United States is the world’s single largest economy: it accounts for
roughly one-quarter of global output and about one-tenth of total trade ﬂows. It is also the
single largest international creditor and debtor. Given its massive size and the strength of its
ties with the global economy, shocks to the U.S. economy are transmitted globally through
a variety of channels, including trade, ﬁnance, and commodity market linkages.

    How strong are business cycle linkages between the United States and other economies?
U.S. business cycles are highly synchronized with global business cycles. Growth is often
higher in the rest of the world during periods of U.S. expansions than it is during U.S.
recessions. The four global recessions since 1960 all coincided with severe recessions in the
United States.

   How large are global spillovers from shocks originating in the United States? Shocks to
U.S. growth, changes in U.S. ﬁscal and monetary policies, or uncertainty in U.S. ﬁnancial
markets or policies have signiﬁcant global spillovers. For example, a surge in U.S. growth
can be expected to accelerate activity in the rest of the world. Our estimates suggest that a
1 percentage point increase in U.S. growth could boost growth in other advanced economies
by 0.8 percentage point, and in EMDEs by 0.6 percentage point, after one year. Investment
could respond even more strongly.

States (Bayoumi and Swiston 2009; Osborn and Vehbi 2013; IMF 2014; Cashin, Mohaddes and Raissi 2012).
For the cyclical spillovers between U.S. and global business cycles, see Kose, Otrok and Whiteman (2008);
Dees and Saint-Guilhem (2009); Huidrom, Kose, and Ohnsorge (2016); World Bank (2016a).

   In contrast, lingering uncertainty about the direction of U.S. policy could dampen activity
and investment abroad. A sustained 10 percent increase in U.S. economic policy uncertainty
could, after one year, reduce U.S. output growth by about 0.15 percentage point and EMDE
output growth by 0.2 percentage point.

    How important is the global economy for the United States? Because of its size and
reach, the United States is at the center of global trade and ﬁnancial networks. U.S. multi-
national corporations and their aﬃliates abroad are deeply integrated into global supply
chains. Financial linkages between the U.S. and the rest of the world, including emerging
market economies, have grown rapidly, widening the potential for spillovers in either direc-
tion. These two-way channels imply that, important as the U.S. economy is for the global
economy, the U.S. economy is in turn aﬀected by developments in the rest of the world.

    In a highly integrated global economy, cross-border linkages translate into signiﬁcant
cyclical spillovers. These spillovers have material implications for all countries, irrespective
of their size. Understanding these linkages and associated spillovers remains a fertile area of
future research.
