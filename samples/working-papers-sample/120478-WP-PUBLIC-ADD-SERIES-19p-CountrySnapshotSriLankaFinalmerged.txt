     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to level the playing field and align the incentives of the financial sector to promote inclusive growth in Sri Lanka. It is designed to modernize the financial
     infrastructure, establish a legal and regulatory framework in line with international standards and enhance the capacity of regulators to conduct comprehensive and forward-
     looking supervision of all financial subsectors. This is expected to result in greater market competition, financial sector efficiency and inclusion of firms and people in the use of
     financial tools. In turn, MSMEs will be able to exploit greater economic opportunities by investing, growing, and creating new and better jobs. To sustain the expected gains in
     poverty reduction and shared prosperity, the project will also help enhance the financial soundness of financial firms, contributing to overall financial and macroeconomic stability.

     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to contribute to increasing financial market efficiency and use of financial services among micro, small, and medium enterprises
     (MSMEs) and individuals. The project will achieve the PDO through modernizing financial market infrastructure, upgrading the legal and regulatory framework for the financial
     system, and strengthening the institutional capacity of financial sector regulators (Central Bank of Sri Lanka, CBSL; Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, SEC; and
     Insurance Board of Sri Lanka, IBSL). On account of its comprehensive approach to creating an enabling environment for robust financial development, the project is also expected
     to advance financial inclusion through (a) increased financial efficiency and competition and (b) the greater reach and financial connectivity of MSMEs and individuals that the new
     and more inclusive financial market infrastructure shall enable.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     The project is expected to achieve the following key results:
     ■■     increased transactions of retail electronic payments on the modernized infrastructure
     ■■     increased trading in the secondary government bond market
     ■■     increased share of private insurance companies in newly issued insurance policies

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Transforming the School Education System as the Foundation of a Knowledge Hub Project aims to enhance equitable access and quality of primary and secondary education to
     provide a foundation for the knowledge-based economic and social development of the country. The project is organized under three components: (i) promoting access to primary
     and secondary education; (ii) improving the quality of education; and (iii) strengthening governance and delivery of education services. These are aligned with the themes of the
     government of Sri Lanka’s Education Sector Development Framework and Program.

     This $100 million project is helping the government to strengthen the country’s education system at multiple levels, including national and provincial educational agencies, but
     especially schools. Several innovative reforms are being supported, including the establishment of a system for conducting national assessments of learning outcomes, school-

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Sri Lanka has around 17,000 early childhood development (ECD) centers serving approximately 513,000 children, 3-5 years old. At the time of project preparation, a national
     survey of ECD centers indicated that less than half the centers met the basic requirements for ECD instructional quality. The coverage of ECD services was also low, with only 65
     percent of the children, 3-5 age, enrolled in ECD centers. ECD provision in Sri Lanka is largely dependent on the non-state sector, and public expenditure on ECD is significantly
     lower than that the expenditures in other middle-income countries.

     Recognizing the importance of the role of ECD in achieving the country’s long-term development goals, the Government decided to increase its support to the sector through the
     Early Childhood Development Project, with the objective of enhancing equitable access to and improving the quality of ECD services across the country. The project is organized
     under two components: (i) expanding and strengthening the delivery of ECD services, and (ii) project management, and monitoring and evaluation. Recognizing that ECD services
     are provided primarily by non-state ECD centers and the sectoral significance of the plantation sector, the project supports both state- and non-state managed ECD centers; and
     to centers located in plantation areas and the rest of the country. The key activities in the project focus on improving the quality of ECD provision, expanding equitable access
     to ECD services, and improving the quality of ECD services in the plantation sector. To enhance the quality of ECD provision, the project supports quality management, facility
     improvement of ECD centers, training of ECD teachers and teacher assistants, and the training of trainers and government staff working in the ECD sector. It supports both
     supply- and demand-side interventions to enhance access to ECD services. Such interventions include parental awareness programs, fee waivers to ECD center students from
     poor households, and establishment or extension of facilities in un-served and underserved areas. The design of the components and activities under the project draws upon the
     findings and recommendations from an ECD study conducted by the World Bank in FY2013/14.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The following key results have been achieved:
     ■■     A National Census of ECD centers has been completed. 1,900 ECD centers have fulfilled minimum quality standards.
     ■■     555,984 children enrolled in ECD centers (girls: 276,383). Teaching and learning material was distributed to 263 ECD centers.
     ■■     102 ECD centers (in plantations) have received facility improvement support for renovation, construction or improvement of play areas; and 1,655 ECD centers (in non-plan-
            tation areas) have been identified for facility improvement grant support in 2017 using the National ECD Census.
     ■■     Training modules and handbook have been finalized and 193 eligible persons have completed training for trainers. The trainers have trained 130 teachers. Modules for
            parental awareness programs have been developed and 139 training sessions were held in the plantation areas. 197 Child Development Officers in plantations completed
            diplomas and 173 currently undergoing Diploma training in the plantation sector.
     ■■     Child development standards assessment tools and guidelines will be implemented starting in 2018.
     ■■     Establishment of ECD Resource Centers in four Provinces has commenced. Completion expected in 2018.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and the Plantation Human Development Trust

     KEY PARTNERS:
     The World Bank, the United National Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and NGOs (e.g. Plan International, Save the Children, World Vision) are active development partners in the early
     childhood development sector in Sri Lanka.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to expand the supply of skilled and employable workers by increasing access to quality and labor market–relevant training programs. It supports implementation
     of the government’s Skills Sector Development Program (SSDP) for 2014-2020. The IDA credit will be complemented by a $100 million loan from the ADB (through parallel
     financing). The ADB operation uses a Performance for Results lending instrument to finance the implementation of the government’s program. Both operations will rely on
     common institutional and implementation arrangements, including a set of similar disbursement-linked indicators and M&E arrangements, to ensure close harmonization. The
     project is comprised of two components:
     ■■   Component 1, the result–based funding component: Supports three closely related types of interventions: (i) strengthening governance and management; (ii) enhancing
          the quality and relevance of training; and (iii) increasing access to training opportunities. Several innovative reforms are being supported under the project, including estab-
          lishment of Industry Sector Skills Councils, introduction of performance-based funding for public training provides, introduction of employment-linked training programs
          to increase employer involvement in design and delivery of training programs, strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system of the skills sector, and improving
          labor-market information systems.
     ■■   Component 2, an innovation, results monitoring, and capacity development component: Help to strengthen implementation, coordination, and the monitoring and evalu-
          ation (M&E) capacity of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The project is expected to achieve the following key results: (1) Increase the number of trainees enrolled in public and private training institutions; (2) Improve the completion rate
     of trainees enrolled in public training institutions; (3) Improve the average earnings of graduates in skills development programs relative to earnings of GCE-O level graduates;
     (4) Increase employer satisfaction with graduates from training institutions. Key results achieved include:
     ■■   Quality management system is set up and installed in 166 training institutes and progressing
     ■■   Four industrial sector skills councils set up to receive input to review and develop competency standards and curricular. Skills Gap Analysis conducted in two sectors with the

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Second Health Sector Development Project supports the implementation of the government’s National Health Development Plan. It aims to upgrade the standards of
     performance of the public health system and enable it to better respond to the challenges of malnutrition and non-communicable disease. More specifically, the project supports
     the implementation of interventions prioritized under the National Health Development Plan for: (i) addressing nutrition, maternal and child health: (ii) improving prevention and
     control of non-communicable diseases: and (iii) improving health systems. Funds are disbursed as budget support linked to agreed results achieved over the given period. The
     project also supports innovation, results monitoring, and capacity building in the health sector.
     The project is implemented in 2 components: (i) Support priority areas under National Health Development Plan which has an IDA contribution of $190 million for 5 years; and
     (ii) Support innovation, result monitoring and capacity building through an IDA contribution of $10 million. This project supports the implementation of 20 results (a subset of the
     National Health Development Plan results). So far, in the fourth year of implementation, all 9 project development objective indicators met or surpassed their targets for 2016 and
     progress against intermediate results indicators which are 11 in number are also positive except for 1 indicator.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     ■■     Developed policies and guidelines for Accidents & Emergencies (A&E) during the first year of the project. Subsequently, 118 new fully functioning A&E service units have
            been established during past 4 years.
     ■■     In 2013, only 759 out of 3,841 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinics had agreed package of equipment and supplies for the provision of care for pregnant women and
            children under 5 years. Currently, 3,235 (84.2%) MCH clinics are equipped.
     ■■     Beginning of SHSDP, electronic reporting of Indoor Morbidity and Mortality (e-IMMR) system was at the experimental stage. By the end of 2016, 389 hospitals out of 572 are
            sending Indoor Morbidity and mortality data electronically.
     ■■     During the first year of the SHSDP, only 98 out of 330 MOH areas had at least 2 healthy life style centers. By 2016, 267 (80.9%) enabling people to have easy access for
            screening, referral and follow up for Non-Communicable Diseases.
     ■■     Prior to the implementation of SHSDP, the health system did not have a formal set of guidelines or protocols for quality management units for health care institutions. With
            World Bank assistance, the ministry was able to develop guidelines for quality management units for health care institutions and currently 108 out of 115 institutions were
            able to establish fully functioning quality management units throughout the country.
     ■■     15 projects have the potential of being scaled up for integration into the national health system. There are 68 foreign capacity building activities identified as priority
            programs in the national capacity building plan, of which 49 programs have already been completed. A total of 3,289 health sector officials have been trained in different
            medical specialties through supporting PhDs, diplomas foreign trainings and certificate courses.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Despite the pro-poor growth of recent years, many households remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. In 2012/13, around 30 percent of Sri Lanka’s 20.8 million people
     consumed less than $2.50 per capita per day in purchasing power parity terms. Sri Lanka also faces a looming demographic burden. Driven by a secular downtrend in the birth rate
     and increased life expectancy (at 74 years in 2012), the dependency ratio is gradually rising as the population ages. A well-designed and adequately funded safety net system is
     essential for addressing these challenges of vulnerability, ageing, and social exclusion.

     The Social Safety Nets Project aims to contribute to the improved equity, efficiency and transparency of Sri Lanka’s social safety net programs for the benefit of the poor and
     vulnerable. The first component is building a Unified Social Registry. The core of the reformed welfare system will be a unified social registry containing data on all current and
     former program beneficiaries and new applicants. This component will finance the Eligible Expenditure Program (EEP) against achievement of results related to the establishment
     of the Welfare Benefits Board and development of the unified social registry. The second component is supporting development of Integrated Service Delivery Systems. This results
     based component will finance the EEP against achievement on collection of data on current beneficiaries and new applicants of programs under the Welfare Benefit Scheme as
     well as to the development of an integrated MIS for the harmonized management of safety net programs. The third is the technical assistance component that will support project
     implementation, monitoring and planning. This component will also support setting up of the Welfare Benefits Board and the development of a national social protection strategy..

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     The project has established the Welfare Benefits Board, which is now fully functional. Other expected results include:
     ■■     Social Registry Information System active and operational.
     ■■     Welfare program budget under the Welfare Benefit Scheme.
     ■■     Social registry populated with current data on beneficiaries of programs under the Welfare Benefit Scheme.
     ■■     Welfare Benefit Scheme beneficiaries qualifying under the eligibility criteria.
     ■■     Divisional secretariats using the integrated MIS for program delivery.

      *$ millions; as of June 30, 2016

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     With rice self-sufficiency secured, a consensus has emerged within the Government that the country should more strategically diversify out of the relatively low value food crops
     and move towards high-value agriculture and promote agricultural exports. This structural shift is critical to sustain income growth in the future, accelerate poverty reduction and
     reverse the trend of increasing inequality.
     While most fruits and vegetables generate higher income as compared to rice, they also demand more intensive labor input, higher levels of technology input, better crop
     management, and investments in post-harvest, marketing, and better organized value chains overall; there is also significant potential for employment growth with such
     diversification. A structural shift towards to a more high-value production structure, agro-processing and value addition activities, and increased competitiveness would also be
     needed. Moreover, there is a need to review existing trade policies to ensure that they support high-value export agriculture; realign public sector support away from general
     fertilizer subsidies to better target support and greater attention to R&D; revisit and relax the rice self-sufficiency policy and allow for more demand-driven and market oriented
     production; and overcome long-standing structural constraints, such as low organizational levels of farmers, land fragmentation, and poor price information systems

     The objective of the project is to support increasing agriculture productivity, improving market access, and enhancing value addition of smallholder farmers and agribusinesses in
     the project areas. The project aims to: (i) improve agriculture value chain development; and (ii) promote productivity enhancement and diversification demonstrations. Through
     the proposed project, the Bank is reengaging in the agriculture sector after many years of absence. The project is planned as part of a longer term engagement. This first project
     would primarily focus on agriculture diversification, pro-poor value-chain development for higher value-added production, and agriculture income generation. The proposed
     project would not address the structural reform issues in the irrigated rice sector and the plantation estate sector at this point. In these important agriculture sub-sectors, the
     Bank would first engage through analytical and technical assistance support with the purpose ofdeveloping a better understanding and consensus for downstream policy and
     institutional reforms as well as investments.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     Key results expected include reaching 110,000 direct beneficiaries (40,000 women); 80,000 clients adopting improved agriculture technology (24,000 women); 25 percent
     increase in average value of sales of products; and 12,500 new jobs generated through investments.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Sri Lanka exhibits a wide array of ecosystems with a diversity of species considered to be the richest per unit area in the Asian region. Many communities living adjacent to
     natural forests are directly and indirectly dependent on the natural ecosystems. About 14 percent of Sri Lanka’s land area is under legal protection. Despite conservation efforts,
     deforestation, forest degradation and biodiversity loss continue. Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a noteworthy issue in the context of Sri Lanka’s development. Sri Lanka has
     the highest density of elephants among the Asian elephant range states. With accelerating development and fragmentation of habitats, innovative landscape management
     approaches are needed to address the human-elephant conflict. Such approaches would balance competing objectives of creating new opportunities for rural poverty reduction
     and employment and sustaining Sri Lanka’s unique elephant population over much of the Dry Zone.

     Nature-based tourism is a fast-growing segment of the global tourism industry creating opportunities for growth and to develop a successful rural development growth strategy.
     Due to the ease of wildlife sighting, Sri Lanka has the potential of being the best nature-based tourism destination outside Africa. Yet nature-based tourism remains underexploited.
     Less than 30 percent of foreign tourists visit the country’s national parks due to poor visitor experience as a result of inadequate management. Much of the sector operates as an
     enclave industry, generating little employment and growth benefits. Only a limited portion of the monetary benefits from nature-based tourism flow to local communities.
     The project objective is to improve the management of ecosystems in selected locations in Sri Lanka for conservation and community benefits Therefore, the project will also
     contribute to the Government’s policies of: (i) increasing and protecting the forest cover for harnessing of ecosystem benefits, including the protection of watersheds for
     agricultural productivity; (ii) developing mechanisms for human-elephant co-existence; (iii) improving the revenue generating capability of protected areas; and (iv) developing
     the capacity for delivering institutional mandates of key natural resources management agencies. The project contributes to the higher-level objective of long-term environmental
     sustainability and inclusiveness of growth and development in and around ecologically sensitive areas in Sri Lanka.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The following are the key results expected to be achieved by the project:
     ■■   Direct benefits to at least 15,000 people from communities living adjacent to Protected Areas due to sustainable use and management of natural resources; and at least
          10,000 people from communities living adjacent to Protected Areas with improved access income generating activities.
     ■■   At least 75 villages and agriculture plots protected as a result of human-elephant co-existence activities.
     ■■   200,000 ha of land brought under enhanced biodiversity protection.
     ■■   10% increase in visitor revenue of selected Protected Areas as a result of project interventions.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Sri Lanka needs to tap into the competitive advantages of the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) to accelerate growth. The CMR will continue to generate much of the capital,
    human resources, technology and services needed for growth in the rest of the country. While the CMR covers only about 6 percent of the country’s total land area and is home
    to 28 percent of its population, it accounts for about 45 percent of national GDP and 80 percent of industrial value added. It is the country’s major urban agglomeration and is
    growing faster than any other metropolitan region in Sri Lanka. A number of obstacles are preventing the CMR from realizing its full economic potential including: (i) inadequate
    infrastructure and services; (ii) significant vulnerability to flooding, the impacts of which are being exacerbated by climate change and sea-level rise; and (iii) poorly design and
    maintained drainage. In addition, limited financial and human resources available to local authorities, combined with their lack of coordination, hinder effective delivery and
    operations and maintenance of local infrastructure services. Integrated planning, management and coordination at the metropolitan level are virtually nonexistent.

    The project aims to support the government in reducing flooding in the catchment of the Colombo Water Basin and strengthen the capacity of local authorities in the CMR to
    rehabilitate, improve and maintain local infrastructure and services through selected demonstration investments.

    KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
    Component 2 (municipal infrastructure) is mostly complete, and key achievements to date include:
    ■■   Contributing to on-the-job capacities of local authorities in CMR, particularly in the areas of procurement, contract management for municipal roads, coordination with utili-
         ties, use of high quality design, and quality and safety standards of municipal roads.
    ■■   Beddegana Wetlands Park has been opened. The park aids in flood control and allows the public to experience the city’s unique urban wetlands. Rehabilitation of the Town
         Square and Viharamahadevi Parks, including the creation of playgrounds, bicycle paths and public facilities.
    ■■   Three kilometers of primary canals have been completed, two micro-drainage subprojects have been implemented, and 29km of roads have been built or rehabilitated based
         on prescribed standards.
    ■■   To date, the project has increased the city’s walkability, safety and quality of life for both pedestrians and motorists as the road redesigns have included pedestrian crossings,
         improved access for those with disabilities as well as flood mitigation measures such as sloping road profiles and side drainage.
    ■■   Improved coordination between central agencies and local authorities and among local authorities within the metropolitan area, and institutionalization of metropolitan-lev-
         el coordination agencies, such as the Metropolitan Wetland Management Department and the Colombo Metropolitan Unit of the Urban Development Authority.
    Component 1 (Flood and Drainage Management in the Colombo Water Basin) supports improvements including building and maintaining a system of drainage, tunnels, canal
    construction and rehabilitation, flood gates, pumping stations and water diversions. It will also support an integrated flood management system to maintain the drainage network,
    the development of an integrated flood management system, and complementary interventions to improve environment and public facilities along the water bodies. This involves
    the largest and most complex flood-reduction works (both from an engineering and safeguard point of view) which are currently under way. The project is anticipated to reduce the
    area under risk of flooding (25-28-year return period) in the project area.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of Sri Lanka, through Bank Technical Assistance (TA) support, initiated its national secondary cities development program in 2012 to tackle key development
     constraints in its secondary cities nationwide. Among various donors, the Bank was the first to take up the initiative through the preparation and delivery of the Sri Lanka Strategic
     Cities Development Project (SCDP), which was approved in May, 2014 with a $147 million IDA credit. The SCDP focused on improving integrated urban services and public spaces
     in two key secondary cities in Sri Lanka - Kandy in the central part of the country and Galle, in the southwest.

     The AF of the SCDP was discussed and agreed upon with the Government of Sri Lanka in order to expand the SCDP to a major city center in the Northern part of the country -
     Jaffna. Jaffna has severely suffered from the three-decade civil conflict and its municipal services and infrastructure assets are in great need of improvement. The AF is a $55
     million IDA credit and includes four sub-components: Drainage and water retention ponds improvements, cultural heritage and public spaces improvements, road connectivity
     improvements, and capacity building of Jaffna Municipal Council and support of strategic TAs.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     Key results expected include:
     ■■   Improved urban services in Kandy, with 320,000 people expected to benefit from improved basic services by the end of the project;
     ■■   Improved urban services in Galle, and a reduction in area at risk of flood inundation within the designated project area in Galle (10-year return period for major canals and
          5-year return period for local drainage);
     ■■   Access to enhanced public urban spaces in Kandy and Galle, through new or rehabilitated urban public spaces and pedestrian sidewalks and pathways; Jaffna Municipal
          Council area residents to benefit from improved basic services, new or rehabilitated urban public spaces (including cultural heritage assets), roads rehabilitated, cycle lanes
          and pedestrian paths rehabilitated or constructed, and storm water drainage and water retention ponds reinstated or rehabilitated.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development.

     ** Includes the original IDA Credit of $110m and an additional financing Credit of $42m approved March 21, 2016

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Climate Resilience Improvement Project (CRIP) aims to reduce the vulnerability of exposed people and assets to climate risk and to improve the government’s capacity to respond
    effectively to disasters. These objectives will be achieved through evidence-based investment planning and urgent risk mitigation measures.

    The project, comprised of an original credit of $110 million and additional financing of $42 million, has two main components. The first component ($13 million) will provide for
    analytical work to build a climate risk-related knowledge base in eleven selected river basins and to identifying over $1 billion of long term investments that will improve physical
    resilience to extreme hydro-meteorological events. The second component ($130 million) supports implementation of urgent climate risk mitigation interventions to increase the
    country’s resilience to climate risks, including rehabilitation works and risk mitigation investments necessitated by the December 2014 floods. The project also has two additional
    components: $7 million to support project implementation and $2 million (CERC) to provide flexible funding to help the country to timely respond to a natural disaster over the
    course of project implementation.
    CRIP was approved alongside a $102 million Development Policy Loan (DPL) with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO) designed to increase fiscal resilience in the
    short term through a line of credit to be used in case of a disaster, and with associated technical assistance.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    A total of approximately 11.5 million people living and working in districts where these projects will be implemented are considered to be the indirect beneficiaries of this
    investment. The total direct beneficiaries from all the components of the project are estimated to be 450,000 spread out among 15 districts. Approximately 48 percent of the
    beneficiaries will be women. The key results are expected to include:
    ■■   The development of eleven basin investment plans that are based on an integrated understanding of climate risk are currently ongoing, with results beginning to be deliv-
         ered at the end of 2016.
    ■■   Decrease in expected annual flood loss across 149,000 hectares (approximately 12 percent of the arable land).
    ■■   Some 1,220,000 fewer people at high risk to climate-related transport interruptions.
    ■■   Reduced landslide risk at 18 schools, serving 29,000 students.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Transport Connectivity and Asset Management Project (TCAMP) is designed to support modern road asset management in the Road Development Authority. It focuses on creating
     an enabling environment for more effective asset management and includes interventions to develop systems and capacity within the RDA and the industry. The project expects to
     demonstrate the implementation of asset management principles in selected priority road corridors of the national road network. It will particularly focus on the institutional and
     system changes that are necessary to transform the RDA from a provider of infrastructure to a service provider in line with the ambitions and needs of a middle-income country.

     The project expects to achieve these objectives through piloting the implementation of an Output and Performance-based Road Contract (OPRC) format, an initiative through which
     the project expects to transform the road development industry of Sri Lanka. The industry is currently suffering from number of issues such as poor quality of work, time extensions
     and non-performing contractors, which have become major obstacles to the Government in implementing road infrastructure and have increased the cost of road development
     work. OPRC is expected to address these issues in two ways: (i) by switching from the existing input-based contracts to output-based contracts where the remuneration (a fixed
     price) is made based on certain performance standards being met and (ii) by having a long-term maintenance period in the contract.

     The project development objective (PDO) is to strengthen the Road Development Authority’s capacity for asset management and improve the road service delivery on the selected
     corridor. The selected corridor means the road section from Ja-Ela to Chilaw on National Highway A003 north of the capital Colombo.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     Following are the expected results of the project;
     ■■   Increase the percentage of new investments which are selected through appropriate technical evaluation using the Road Asset Management System (RAMS)
     ■■   Reduce the roughness in the selected road section (from Ja-Ela to Chilaw on National Highway A003)
     ■■   Increase the user satisfaction on the selected road section (from Ja-Ela to Chilaw on National Highway A003)
     ■■   Create a Road Asset Management Unit
     ■■   Increase the number of rehabilitated non-rural roads
     ■■   Reduce the number of accidents on the selected road section (from Ja-Ela to Chilaw on National Highway A003)

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Dams are part of essential infrastructure for Sri Lanka’s irrigation, hydropower, and domestic and industrial water supply needs, as well as to provide flood control. At present,
    about 85 percent of the developed water resources are used for irrigation in the dry zone, which covers nearly two-thirds of the country. The dam network in Sri Lanka comprises
    over 270 medium and 80 large dams.
    Due to lack of maintenance, the dams pose an escalating public safety threat. Many large dams are ageing and suffer from various structural deficiencies and shortcomings in
    operation and monitoring facilities, requiring urgent attention.
    The project aims to: (i) establish long-term sustainable arrangements for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of large dams; and (ii) improve water resources planning.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    The original credit of the project was fully disbursed and closed at the end of June 2015. Results include:
    ■■   Remedial work at 41 dams has been completed. Work is in progress in the remaining 22 dams to be rehabilitated, and is expected to be completed before the project closing.
    ■■   A total of 120 hydro-meteorological stations have been completed and are transmitting data to the two centers. 46 additional stations are being installed. Data validation is
         ongoing, and work is underway for utilizing the data gathered.
    ■■   The Cabinet approved in December 2016 three plans prepared under the project, namely the National Water Use Master Plan, Mahaweli Water Development Plan (updated),
         and the Mundeni Aru River Basin Plan, advising the National Planning Department to use them as guides for future water resources planning.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Since 2000 the Government has set out a range of policies covering all aspects of the water and sanitation sector which, taken together, provide a sound framework within which
     the sector operates. The Government’s vision for the water sector is to provide access to safe drinking water for all citizens over the medium term (by 2020) with a particular
     emphasis on increasing the quality of service (increasing the proportion of people served through piped water connections to 60 percent and tripling coverage by sewerage
     systems to 7 percent, while 90% of households rely on on-site sanitation such as septic tanks and latrines). The government also envisages a sector with improved institutional
     performance where tariffs are set to ensure cost recovery, and regulatory reforms are introduced, so that there can be greater self-financing of capital works through innovative
     financing structures. In rural areas, there will be a continued focus on community involvement in water supply and greater collaboration between the various actors in the sector
     including the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and the local authorities.

     The development objectives of the project are to increase access to piped water services and improved sanitation in selected districts; and to strengthen the capacity of associated
     institutions.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The project, which became effective in December 2015, is expected to deliver the following key results:
     ■■   Urban water and sanitation – 6 water supply schemes and 7 septage treatment facilities
     ■■   Rural water supply and sanitation – approx. 320 new water schemes
     ■■   Estates sector water supply and sanitation – approx. 130 schemes and 7,500 latrines
     ■■   Institutional support to: strengthen capacity/operationalise Department of National Community Water Supply; enhance CBO performance; strengthen other institutions
     ■■   Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) system development to monitor CBO performance
     ■■   Strategic investment program for NWSDB
     ■■   Water quality mapping and CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology) support
