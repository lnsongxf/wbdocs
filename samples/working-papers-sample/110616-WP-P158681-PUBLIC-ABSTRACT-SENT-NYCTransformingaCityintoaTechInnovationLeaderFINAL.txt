and promoting the local ecosystem to attract need-

> Policies were focused in areas where there was a
market failure and where they could catalyze mar-
ket solutions that would be sustainable over time.

> The program addressed the ecosystem as a
community and not as a “innovation district.” This
allowed the ecosystem to expand beyond physical
boundaries and grew organically, benefiting multiple
neighborhoods of the city.

Where a pilot project proved successful, it was then
scaled up. This is the case of city-sponsored incu-
bators for startup businesses that became corner-
stones for the development of the tech industry in
NYC. Starting with the first incubator in 2009, NYC
currently has 16 city-sponsored incubators scat-
tered throughout the five boroughs, and with specific
areas/sectors of focus (see Figure 2.1.)

Network of coworking spaces/incubators

NYCEDC addressed the lack of office space
through a pilot project: a coworking space/incu-
bator. This was one of the first policy actions of NY-
CEDC, with the first city-sponsored incubator (160
Varick Street) opening in 2009. The concept proved
successful in addressing the lack of office space
and it evolved, expanding its goal to promote entre-
preneurship in thematic industries (linked to those
identified in previous strategic plans of the city as
those where New York has competitive advantage).
Today the network of incubators has grown to over
15 across the city and is managed by the Center for
Economic Transformation (CET) at NYCEDC23.

ed personally in the tech community’s events since
2008. The Mayor could be seen with early entrepre-
neurs in the First Internet Week Event in New York in
2008 or in New York Tech Meetups supporting the
community and promoting New York as a city for
entrepreneurs . The appointment of a CDO in the
city to interact with and support the tech commu-
nity provided additional backing combined with agile
reaction to the community’s needs.

The city launched an intense promotion cam-
paign to highlight New York’s entrepreneurs to
attract talent and raise the profile and signifi-
cance of the tech community. The city launched
“We are Made in NY” in 2002, an economic develop-
ment initiative that focuses on the local tech sector,
highlights job opportunities, attracts new companies
to the city, and presents a host of education pro-
grams that support learning at every literacy level.
Expanding the Made in NY Mark of Distinction for
digital companies that base at least 75 percent of
their development in NYC, to capitalize on local tal-
ent and achievements, was also another focal point
to promote the city’s tech sector. The city also cre-
ated a central point of information for the tech eco-
system in New York, Digital.NYC , where interested
parties could access information about startups,
investment, spaces, or training courses in the city.
All this was combined with advertising and promo-
tion of success stories of entrepreneurs, raising the
profile of New York as a tech startup hub. In parallel,
the mayor’s office also involved itself in attracting
prominent tech startup to open operational offices
in New York, offering tax breaks.

Additional Supportive Policies

New York combined NYCEDC operational policy
actions with strategic support actions. As part of
the strategic policies stemming from the NYC Digital
City Roadmap, the city supported the tech startup
ecosystem through: (a) development of broadband
access infrastructure, and (b) government as a plat-
form as part of the open government agenda. On
connectivity, by 2013, 99 percent of New Yorkers
had residential access to high-speed broadband,

namics enabling growth of the ecosystem and the
support of a community of stakeholders beyond the
tech entrepreneurs themselves, bringing in large cor-
porations, universities, and civil society from around
the city. It also increased the image of the city to
attract talent for the tech ecosystem, which previ-
ously did not consider New York as a tech-friendly
city. This was especially relevant for New York, giv-
en that over 80 percent of the tech founders came
from outside the city (Endeavor Insights 2014).

< 12 > The city government served as an active
platform for the development of tech solutions.
The support of the city went beyond promotion
and formal backing. The city consciously developed
a policy of open data and open government, which
fed the tech startup community. There was a strat-
egy to provide open data, with tools specific to open
data from the city, combined with an invitation to
tech entrepreneurs to address challenges (for exam-
ple, the BigApps Competition). These policies were
connected with the network of incubators or the
seed fund to grow the ecosystem and form a larg-
er community. The provision of the city’s data and
challenges served as a catalyst to form cohorts of
potential startup founders through hackathons and
competitions which connected socially to feed the
tech community.
