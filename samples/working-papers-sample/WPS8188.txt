1     Introduction
Quickly assessing and estimating the damage caused after the incidence of a natural disaster is important
for both central and local governments, emergency services and aid workers, so that they can respond
eﬃciently and deploy resources where they are most needed. Recently, remote sensing technologies have
been used to analyze the impact of disasters, such as hurricanes (Myint et al., 2008; Klemas, 2009),
ﬂoods (Haq et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012, 2014; Chung et al., 2015), landslides (Nichol et al., 2006),
earthquakes (Fu et al., 2005; Yamazaki & Matsuoka, 2007), wildﬁres (Holden et al., 2005; Roy et al.,
2006), volcanoes (Carn et al., 2009; Ferguson et al., 2010) and tsunamis (R¨  omer et al., 2012). These
remote sensing techniques are useful for providing quick damage estimates shortly after the disasters
giving emergency services a chance to respond quickly and local governments an overview of estimated
costs and necessary repairs.

    In addition to their usefulness in the aftermath of a disaster, estimates of the potential damage as-
sociated with a natural disaster are also useful for policy making prior to the realization of the natural
hazard event. In many cases the incidence of a natural hazard event can turn into a natural disaster
simply because of inadequate preparation ex-ante. Indonesia, for example, is highly exposed to natural
disasters by being situated in one of the worlds most active disaster hot spots, where several types of
disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, ﬂoods, landslides, droughts and forest ﬁres
frequently occur. The average annual cost of natural disasters, over the last 10 years, is estimated at 0.3
percent of Indonesian GDP, although the economic impact of such disasters is generally much higher at
local or subnational levels (The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, 2011). The high
frequency of disasters experienced has important impacts on expenditures by local governments that
could be anticipated, at least in part, through upward adjustments in the annual ﬁscal transfers from
the central government to the subnational governments.1 Such ex-ante adjustments in the level of ﬁscal
transfers would be more useful if they could be based on estimates of the potential damages associated
with the incidence of a natural disaster as opposed to estimates of the intensity of the potential natural
hazard that might occur. However, although in recent years there has been much progress towards the
modeling of the main natural hazards, there continues to be a scarcity of estimates of the damages
associated with the incidence of these disasters. The value of damage caused by a natural disaster is typ-
ically a complicated function of the size of population living in that area, the level and type of economic
activity carried out, the value of the physical infrastructure in place, and the resilience of infrastructure
and people’s livelihoods to the natural hazards.

   This paper ﬁlls some of the gaps in the literature by using diﬀerent remote sensing sources and data
on the physical characteristics of the events to construct four damage indices for natural disasters in
Indonesia. The indices cover ﬂoods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and a tsunami, and are all weighted
by local economic activity in an area, and then aggregated up to a district level.2 All data used in the
construction of the indices are free and publicly available, making the methods used a potentially very
useful alternative for both central and local governments to quickly get a rough estimate of the damages
caused by a disaster (either ex-ante or ex-post).3

    Importantly, all of the indices constructed take into account local exposure. Given limited access
to highly disaggregated local economic activity data, nightlight intensity derived from satellite imagery
has proved to be a good proxy; see, for instance, Henderson et al. (2012), Hodler & Raschky (2014) and
Michalopoulos & Papaioannou (2014). By utilizing the grid cells of approximately 1 square kilometer we
can break down areas in cities and districts into where they are busiest, and thus take into account not
only the local physical characteristics of a natural disaster but also the local economic activity exposed
to it.

   The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 of the paper discusses in more detail the incidence and
types of natural disasters. Section 3 discusses the nightlights data. Sections 4-7 discuss in detail the
construction of the four damage indices, while section 8 concludes.
   1 For example, Indonesia experienced 4,000 disasters between 2001 and 2007 alone, including ﬂoods (37%), droughts

(24%), landslides (11%) and windstorms (9%) (The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, 2011).
   2 A tropical cyclone index was also constructed, but no hurricanes had strong enough winds to cause any damage on

land.
   3 In a separate paper, Skouﬁas et al. (2017), we correlate the damage indices of these disasters at the district level with

the ex-post allocation of district expenditures in diﬀerent sectors and by economic classiﬁcation.

2     Natural Disasters in Indonesia
Natural disasters are prevalent events across most parts of Indonesia. According to the Indonesian Na-
tional Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) there were more than 19,000 natural disasters in the
period 2001 - 2015 (National Disaster Management Agency, BNPB, 2016), making Indonesia a useful
country for any natural disaster analysis. The most frequent disasters are ﬂoods and landslides (52 per-
cent), strong winds (21 percent) and ﬁres (15 percent), while the most damaging ones are earthquakes,
tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, which all cause major damage to buildings and infrastructure in ad-
dition to the human casualties. The deadliest year according to the BNPB data was 2004, where there
were more than 167,000 deaths due to natural disasters and 166,671 of them stemming from the tsunami
in December 2004.


2.1     Floods
The tropical climate of Indonesia often leads to annual ﬂoods. The BNPB data registered more than
10,000 incidents of ﬂoods or landslides leading to more than 3,500 fatalities from 2001 through 2015.
During the period from 1985 to 2016, The Darthmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) registered 3,808 ﬂoods
of magnitude 4 or more and 1,175 ﬂoods of magnitude 6 and up.4 Of these ﬂoods, there were 126 large
scale ﬂoods with a centroid within Indonesia in the period from 2001 to 2016 as can be seen in Figure 1.
Of the 34 provinces, 27 experienced having a centroid of a large scale ﬂood event during these years.5



                          Figure 1: DFO Large Scale Floods in Indonesia 2001-2016




                                                Source: G.R.Brakenridge (2016)

    4 Magnitude is deﬁned as: M = log(D ∗ S ∗ AA), where D is the duration of the ﬂood; S is the severity on a scale

consisting of 1 (large event), 1.5 (very large event) and 2 (extreme event); and AA is the size of the aﬀected area. Flood
events registered by DFO have mainly been derived from news and governmental sources.
    5 The provinces where no large scale centroid was present were Bangka Belitung, Riau Islands, Kalimantan Barat,

Yogyakarta, Sulawesi Barat, Kalimantan Utara and Maluku. Note that some of these, like Kalimantan Utara, Kalimantan
Barat, Sulawesi Barat and Yogakarta, did most likely experience large scale ﬂood during these years, but that the centroid
was in another province. The remaining three provinces consist mainly of smaller islands, so the ﬂooded area will most
likely not constitute a large scale ﬂood event.



                                                              3
2.2     Earthquakes
Due to Indonesia’s location inside the Paciﬁc Ring of Fire, one of the most seismically active areas in
the world, it is often struck by earthquakes. BNPB counted almost 400 earthquakes from 2001 to 2015,
with the largest number of casualties coming from the tsunami created by a 9.0 earthquake located oﬀ
the coast of Aceh, otherwise known as the earthquake that caused the 2004 tsunami. Apart from that,
there were more than 8,000 registered fatalities due to earthquakes over the same period. Overall, this
makes earthquakes the deadliest of the natural disasters that strike Indonesia.

   Figure 2 shows how common earthquakes are in Indonesia by displaying contour maps6 of all earth-
quakes of magnitude 5.0 and above that struck Indonesia from 2004 through 2014. In total, the United
States Geological Survey (USGS) registered 261 earthquakes.7

2.3     Volcanic activity
Indonesia has the highest number of active volcanoes in the world, numbering almost 150. Of these, many
have had eruptions in both more historical times and after the year 2000. The most famous eruption is
probably the explosion of Krakatau in August 1883, when two-thirds of the Krakatau Island erupted and
disappeared, killing more than 35,000 people and causing a global mini ice age and weather disruptions
for years. BNPB have registered 92 eruptions over our 15-year time period and more than 60 major
volcanoes that have had eruptions since 1900. The most recent one is the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption
  6 These   maps are also known as ShakeMaps, which are produced by USGS.
  7 There   are 1,002 earthquakes registered by USGS that were of magnitude 5.0 or more that had a point with a PGA of
at least 0.05 within Indonesia. Many of these points create little to no damage. The 261 earthquakes mentioned above are
quakes that are mostly contained within Indonesia.

that killed 324 people and dislocated more than 320,000.

    In addition to the BNPB data, during the years 2004 through 2015 the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory
Centre (DVAAC) had 587 days where they issued a red warning, implying an ongoing or imminent
volcanic eruption. The most active volcanoes - measured by number of days with red warnings - are
shown in Table 1, with the top 5 volcanoes constituting almost 75 percent of the red warnings. These are
also volcanoes that have been in the media, with Merapi already mentioned and Sinabung, which had
several eruptions in 2010, 2013 and 2014. These two volcanoes are located close to densely populated
areas, with Sinabung located in North Sumatra and Merapi in central Java.

2.4    2004 Christmas Tsunami
The Christmas Tsunami in 2004 is the worst singular natural disaster during the modeling period, and
one of the worst natural disasters in world history. As seen in the photo in Figure 3 the destruction was
absolute in parts of Indonesia. The total death toll across Indonesia and 13 other countries was more
than 230,000 people and there were many more missing. In addition, the World Bank (2005) estimated a
total economic impact of 4.5 billion US dollars. The oﬃcial BNPB data for Indonesia estimates 166,671
deaths due to the tsunami.

    The cause of the tsunami was an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 150 miles south-south east of Banda
Aceh on the morning of 26 December. This quake created a tsunami with waves more than 20 meters
high at the highest. Due to the fault line of the earthquake being in a north-south direction, the greatest
strength of the tsunami was in an east-west direction (Athukorala & Resosudarmo, 2005). This led to
the largest damages being in the northern part of Sumatra, in the province of Aceh, where entire villages
were wiped out as seen in the photo of Banda Aceh (Figure 3).

3     Nightlight Data
Natural disasters are inherent local phenomena in that they either aﬀect only parts of areas and/or
aﬀect parts within areas diﬀerently. It is thus important to take the local population/asset exposure
into account when constructing more aggregate proxies. Arguably one would like to have measures of
exposure as spatially disaggregated as possible. For a country like Indonesia, data are usually sparse and
at a very aggregated spatial level.

    An alternative approach is thus to use nightlights as a proxy for local economic activity. As a matter
of fact, nightlights have found widespread use where no other measures are available; see, for instance,
Henderson et al. (2012), Hodler & Raschky (2014) and Michalopoulos & Papaioannou (2014). In Hender-
son et al. (2012), Indonesia is used as an example of using nightlights to capture an economic downturn
following the Asian ﬁnancial crisis in the late 1990s. Their results show that swings in GDP change can
generally be captured. Nevertheless one has to account for factors such as cultural diﬀerences in light
usage, latitude and gas ﬂares. In our case this is unlikely to aﬀect our results since we use nightlights to
capture exposure within a country rather than across countries.

    The nightlight imagery we employ is provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
(DMSP) satellites. In terms of coverage each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute near-polar orbit at
an altitude of about 800km above the surface of the earth, providing global coverage twice per day, at
the same local time each day, with a spatial resolution of about 1km near the equator. The resulting
images provide the percentage of nightlight occurrences for each pixel per year normalized across satel-
lites to a scale ranging from 0 (no light) to 63 (maximum light). Yearly values were then constructed as
simple averages across daily values of grids, and are available from 1992.8 We use the stable, cloud-free
series; see Elvidge et al. (1997).

    The data revealed 414,644 cells which had a nightlight value greater than 0 in them at least once
during the period 2001-2013. Figure 4 - containing all cells with nightlights in 2012 - shows that the
large cities and densely populated areas on Java, Sunda Islands, coastal Kalimantan and Sumatra are
fully covered in lights. Inner parts of Kalimantan and most parts of New Guinea are more sparsely lit.



                                Figure 4: Cells with Registered Nightlights in 2012




   8 For the years where satellites were replaced, DMSP provides an average from both the new and old satellite. In this

paper we use the imagery from the most recent satellite but as part of our sensitivity analysis we also re-estimated our
results using an average of the two satellites and the older satellite only. The results of these latter two options were almost
quantitatively and qualitatively identical.


                                                               6
4     Flood Damage Index
The modeling of ﬂoods can be done by remote sensing (Brakenridge & Anderson, 2006; Wu et al., 2012;
Haq et al., 2012) or through a combination of weather data and GIS systems as for example in Knebl
et al. (2005); Asante et al. (2007); Dessu et al. (2016). We utilize the latter, as remote sensing is useful
for assessing whether an area is ﬂooded or not, but it is weaker on modeling the intensity of the ﬂood.
Moreover, cloud cover generally limits the accurate detection of ﬂoods from remote sensing sources.

    To model ﬂoods we have decided to use the Geospatial Stream Flow Model (GeoSFM) which is
a software that is “designed to use remotely sensed meteorological data in data sparse parts of the
world”(Artan et al., 2008). GeoSFM was developed by USGS and USAID and is a hydrological model-
ing tool used to model stream ﬂows across large areas, in particular areas where highly localized data are
lacking. It has been used in regions such as the Great Horn of Africa (Asante et al., 2007; Mati et al.,
2008; Dessu et al., 2016) and Nepal (Shrestha et al., 2011), with Dessu et al. (2016) ﬁnding that the
model captures 76% of the monthly average variability, making it useful for ﬂood simulation.

    The inputs needed to model stream ﬂow for basins are soil- and terrain-based - such as digital el-
evations models (DEM) and land cover and soil data - and weather-based, such as precipitation and
potential evapotranspiration (PET) data. The HYDRO1K data set from USGS, which is a DEM made
for hydrological modeling based on the USGS’ 30 arc-second DEM of the world, is used as elevation
input. The land cover data are the Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC) data set also from
USGS, while the soil data are from the FAO Digital Soil Map of the World.

   The daily precipitation data are from the 3-hourly data set from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement
Mission Project (TRMM) and the PET data are 6-hourly data from the Global Data Assimilation Sys-
tem (GDAS), both data sets are aggregated up to daily data. The PET data are available from February
2001 and onwards, while the precipitation data are available for the period 1998-2014. Given that we
only have nightlight data through 2013, we will focus on ﬂoods for the period 2001-2014.

   GeoSFM uses the inputs to construct basins based on the terrain and then uses a linear soil moisture
accounting routine to model surface runoﬀ and soil moisture based on precipitation and PET. It is worth
noting that although a more complex and better non-linear routine is also supported, it does not work
well for our more generalized macro-modeling with fairly low resolution data. Finally, GeoSFM models
the stream ﬂow for each basin for each day of our time period.

   Note that GeoSFM does not model coastal ﬂoods, nor does it model ﬂash ﬂoods in areas where there
are no rivers or streams of a certain length. Figure 5 shows that there are parts of Indonesia and even
one province - Riau Islands - which have no basins. Another weakness is that it does not take into
consideration the speciﬁc terrain within each basin. Floods are generally very localized events and the
low resolution of our data makes it impossible to model the intensity of the stream ﬂow within a basin
and also causes some river outlets to be slightly inland instead of running all the way to the ocean.

4.1    Creation of Index and Results
The ﬁrst part of constructing the index involves deﬁning when a ﬂood event is happening. In Wu et al.
(2012) they propose four runoﬀ based methods to deﬁne a ﬂood threshold, and in addition Wu et al.
(2014) propose a slightly modiﬁed ﬂood threshold deﬁnition with a point being ﬂooded when:

                                  R > P95 + σ       and     Q > 10m3 /s                                 (1)

   where R is the routed runoﬀ in millimeters, P95 is the 95th percentile value and σ is the standard
deviation of the routed runoﬀ. Q is the discharge in cubic meters.

   We found that with the GeoSFM modeled data, runoﬀ was not a good proxy for ﬂooding, due to it
only capturing a limited number of ﬂoods. Discharge, Q, was a better proxy, leading to a new - but very
similar - equation:
                                Q > P95 + σ     and      Q > 10m3 /s                                (2)

                                      Figure 5: Basins by Province




   By manually checking against the DFO ﬂoods, we ﬁnd that our data do hit several of the large scale
events in Figure 1.


4.1.1   Damage Index
Due to ﬂoods being very localized, the modeling of damage is diﬃcult, and no standard exists in the
literature. Penning-Rowsell et al. (2005) base destruction on value of housing stock and the Standards of
Protection and then uses an estimate of number of properties aﬀected by diﬀerent return period ﬂoods.
Scawthorn et al. (2006) use a combination of building stock and velocity of the stream ﬂow, whereas
Kreibich et al. (2009) look at diﬀerent parameters such as velocity, depth, energy head, stream ﬂow
and intensity. They ﬁnd velocity to be a poor parameter for assessing damage, while water depth and
energy head show the best results. Stream ﬂow and intensity are also weak as parameters. Finally, Merz
et al. (2010) assess diﬀerent damage inﬂuencing parameters and point to the fact that most “damage
inﬂuencing factors are neglected in damage modeling, since they are very heterogeneous in space and
time, diﬃcult to predict, and there is limited information on their (quantitative) eﬀects”. Overall, there
is limited support in the literature for a strong correlation between these parameters and damages on
anything but a very localized scale.

    As for assessing the damage itself, Merz et al. (2010) discuss damage functions and the two main
approaches, which involve one empirical approach where damage data are collected after the ﬂood and
one synthetic approach where they construct potential what if-scenarios. Once again the assessments
rest on very localized data, which we do not have for Indonesia. Overall, it means that we cannot expect
anything more than rough estimates. A common denominator for the papers mentioned above is that
there is some measurement of intensity. Given that stream ﬂow is an intensity proxy, we have used that
to construct a simple measurement for intensity. The equation is:

                                              0          : F lood = 0
                                    Ib,t =          ¯b
                                              Qb,t −Q                                                  (3)
                                                 σb      : F lood = 1


                                                    8
    where Ib,t is the intensity of the ﬂood in basin b at date t, Qb,t is the stream ﬂow in the same basin
at the same time and Q   ¯ b and σb are mean and standard deviation of stream ﬂow in b. The intensity
is set to zero if the ﬂood threshold - 95th percentile plus 1 standard deviation above the average - has
not been exceeded. By normalizing, we obtain a measure that is comparable across all regions and that
is independent of the absolute river ﬂows. The assumption is that people living close to rivers will be
prepared for variations in water levels, and that people living close to rivers with highly variable stream
ﬂows are more prepared for these events than people living close to more stable rivers.

   To aggregate the ﬂood impact each basin is weighted based on the nightlights in it. The weights per
basin, Wb,t−1 , used are:
                                                                     I
                                                       Lb,t−1        i   Li,t−1
                                           Wb,t−1 =           =      J
                                                                                                        (4)
                                                       Lp,t−1        j   Lj,t−1
   where Lb,t−1 is the sum of lights in basin b one year, t − 1, before the ﬂood year and Lp,t−1 is the
same at a province level.

    Finally, the weights from (4) are multiplied with the intensity from (3) to get the overall ﬂood impact,
FI b,t in that basin on the province:

                                                 FI b,t = Wb,t−1 ∗ Ib,t                                 (5)
   One thing to note here is that for basins that span several provinces or districts, we have assumed
the same intensity, but the weight is based on nightlights within each individual province.


4.1.2      Results
The stream ﬂow was simulated for 5,082 consecutive days, from 1 February 2001 to 31 December 2014.9
Table 2 shows that the top 10 basins with most ﬂood days had close to 200 days of ﬂooding over the
14-year period. As expected, these basins do overlap with some of the busiest ﬂood areas according to
the DFO, as shown in Figure 6. The lower part of Table 2 reveals that the driest basin had a mere
12 days of ﬂooding. All 33 provinces with a basin had days that went above our ﬂood threshold set in
Equation (2).

   All months in our model have ﬂood events, but there are big diﬀerences. The range goes from 527
events every March and down to 154 events every August, with the traditional rainy season (November-
March) producing the highest number of ﬂood events, whereas the dry season months (June-October)
are the driest. Aggregating the numbers for the rainy season, there are 2,215 events every year across
the basins, while there are only 995 events every year during the dry season.

    Total number of basins that are partly or fully inside Indonesia is 495, and these basins have a total
of 55,605 ﬂood events or slightly more than 112 per basin. In other words, the average basin has been
ﬂooded for a total of 8 days a year over the 14-year period in question. This is not entirely unexpected
given the climate in Indonesia and the way our threshold is made. Also, if we compare with the DFO
data where they have 3,808 ﬂoods of magnitude 4 or higher through their period from 1985-2016, which
converts to almost 123 fairly large scale ﬂood events per year, our model provides a reasonable proxy for
events.

    Even though the results seem logical on a per basin basis, the time steps in the model are 1 day at a
time, which is too slow for the unfolding of a ﬂood event, implying that downstream basins that would
normally ﬁll up very quickly will now only be ﬁlled up the day after, and then the next basin will be
ﬁlled two days later and so forth. This means that the amount of days with ﬂoods are inﬂated. We
believe that this does not aﬀect our results much, though, as the number of events per province will not
aﬀect the end results, since we weigh by aﬀected nightlight and not by number of days of ﬂoods.

   Despite the numerous ﬂoods in Indonesia, they generally do not aﬀect a large percentage of the pop-
ulation, as per Table 3. The mean of nightlights when excluding areas with 0 nightlight is 3.39 percent.
  9 For   Bali we did it for 5,080 days due to problems with 30 and 31 December 2014.

If we assume that 3.39 percent of the approximately 250 million people of Indonesia are aﬀected, the

4.1.3   Comparison of Model versus DFO Floods
The DFO ﬂood database is mostly based on news sources, providing an overview of the big ﬂoods in
Indonesia. To check the database against the GeoSFM model, the focus will be on the largest events of
magnitude 6 and above. Given how the DFO data do not give any intensity estimates and focus primar-
ily on displacement numbers and area, while our model is driven by intensity the comparison will only
focus on whether GeoSFM results do overlap in time and/or province with the centroid of the DFO ﬂoods.

    Table 4 shows the DFO data on the left side, ﬁrst column being the start month of the ﬂood, followed
by duration, magnitude, the province where the centroid of the ﬂood is, dead and displaced. The right
side shows the modeling results where the focus is on duration. The ﬁrst column under model results
shows the number of days for the centroid province, then overall number of days with ﬂoods anywhere
in Indonesia during the period, then looking at the same island - using that as a proxy for neighboring
regions - where one examines total days the island provinces were ﬂooded during the ﬂood and ﬁnally
how many of the days of the ﬂood duration that a province on the same island was ﬂooded.

    Generally, the model performs well, in particular on Sumatra and Kalimantan (Borneo), with the
example where the 2008 ﬂood was captured for all 25 days in the centroid province. Overall, it shows
at least one ﬂooded basin on Kalimantan and Sumatra for 85% of the days the major ﬂoods happened.
The results are somewhat worse on Java, where only 37% of the days have a ﬂood. A primary reason
for this might be that Java is very narrow and hence the streams are short and might not be cap-
tured in our model. Java also has larger percentage of land not covered by a basin, ref Figure 5, also
due to its narrowness which makes the low resolution landcover data underestimate the size of the basins.


4.1.4   Aggregated numbers
Finally, to aggregate up to a district or province level, we have used a simple method for the total damage
experienced per year:
                                                     T     B
                                          P Dj,T =             FI j,b,t                                (6)
                                                       t   b

    where j is the province or district, T is the year, sum of t is all the days for year T , sum of b are
all the basins in the province or district and FI b,t is the ﬂood impact from Equation 5. Normally one
might use an average ﬂood impact across the year, but by doing this, we capture repeated ﬂood events
and areas that experience generally high ﬂooding.

   Using the above method, Table 5 provides the aggregated data for all provinces across all years. The
impact is fairly even for the most impacted ones, with the impact numbers for the top 10 ranging from
44 to 55. Furthermore, Sumatera Selatan, Lampung and Yogyakarta make up 8 of the top 10 impacted
provinces. The overall picture ﬁts with the DFO ﬂoods in Figure 1, with the populous provinces in Java,
Sumatra and Sulawesi being impacted, whereas the smaller island provinces and parts of Kalimantan
are not aﬀected much. For some of the island provinces the numbers are probably underestimated, no
basins will have been constructed and modeled there due to the many small islands.

    Finally, Table 6 shows the most impacted districts over the years 2001 through 2014. The impact is
much larger than for the provinces as one would expect due to the more localized data and impact. The
districts are also more geographically spread out than the provinces.

5    Earthquake Damage Index
The measurement of earthquake detection and intensity has improved with remote sensing techniques.
There are diﬀerent methods to assess intensity and damage, ranging from satellite images (Dell’Acqua
& Gamba, 2012; Tralli et al., 2005; Gillespie et al., 2007) to contour maps generated by seismological
ground stations (De Groeve et al., 2008; GeoHazards International and United Nations Centre for Re-
gional Development, 2001; Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2006).

    This paper uses the latter method, by utilizing ShakeMaps from USGS, which are automatically
generated maps providing several key parameters following an earthquake, such as peak ground accel-
eration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV) and modiﬁed Mercalli intensity (MMI). More speciﬁcally,
the ShakeMaps use data from seismic stations that is interpolated using an algorithm which is similar
to kriging. To model the intensity in a given coordinate, the model also takes into account ground con-
ditions and the depth of earthquake. Wald et al. (2005) point to the magnitude and epicenter location -
which are parameters common for the entire earthquake - that have historically been used to determine
how severe earthquakes were, but that the damage pattern is not just dependent on those two parame-
ters, but also on other, more localized parameters that the ShakeMaps use to generate intensity measures.

    This is exempliﬁed by several earthquakes such as magnitude 6.7 and 6.9 earthquakes in California
in 1994 and 1989, respectively, where some areas further away from the epicenters got more damaged
than closer areas. The reason why the more localized ShakeMaps with their ground shaking parameters
are a better gauge than magnitude and epicenter distance is explained on page 13 of Wald et al. (2005)
which states that: “..., although an earthquake has one magnitude and one epicenter, it produces a range
of ground shaking levels at sites throughout the region depending on distance from the earthquake, the
rock and soil conditions at sites, and variations in the propagation of seismic waves from the earthquake
due to complexities in the structure of the Earth’s crust.” The ShakeMaps are interpolated grids with
point coordinates spaced approximately 1.5 kilometers apart (0.0167 degrees). Figure 2 shows contoured
maps of these points.

    The PGA is a measure of the maximum horizontal ground acceleration as a percentage of gravity,
PGV is the maximum horizontal ground speed in centimeters per second and MMI is the perceived
intensity of the earthquake, a subjective measure. Figure 7 - which is originally found in Wald et al.
(1999) - explains the relationship between the diﬀerent parameters and the potential damage from dif-
ferent values. The assumption is that damage starts at an MMI level of V and a PGA of 3.9 percent of
g . These levels are found for California in Wald et al. (1999), but the relationship has been found for
other areas in the US in Atkinson & Kaka (2006) and Atkinson & Kaka (2007) and for places such as
Costa Rica (Linkimer, 2007) and Japan, Southern Europe and Western US (Murphy & O’Brien, 1977).
It should be noted that the numerical relationship diﬀers from region to region. There are no known
papers estimating these values speciﬁcally for Indonesia.

   The diﬀerent measures are largely interchangeable, and in GeoHazards International and United
Nations Centre for Regional Development (2001) report, they use PGA to measure damage, pointing to
the fact that PGA, unlike MMI is an objective measure, implying that MMI is not easy to obtain reliably
across the globe. Also, for large scale modeling, where it is unfeasible for one to model local conditions
precisely, PGA serves as a good proxy for intensity of earthquakes.

5.1     Creation of Damage Index and Results
5.1.1    Damage Index
To construct the damage index, two types of data will be used; the intensity data - expressed as PGA -
and building inventory data, to assess what damage one could expect for diﬀerent intensities.

    To take into account the building types in Indonesia, we use information from the USGS building
inventory for earthquake assessment, which provides estimates of the proportions of building types ob-
served by country; see Jaiswal & Wald (2008). The data provide the share of 99 diﬀerent building types
within a country separately for urban and rural areas. For Indonesia the building type information was
compiled from a World Housing Encyclopedia survey, while the split between urban and rural is from the
urban extent map of Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN - Columbia
University et al. (2011). Without any other information available, we use this as an indication of the
distribution of building types in Indonesia, but, necessarily, assume that the distribution is homogenous
within urban and rural areas.

    Fragility curves by building type are derived from the curves constructed by Global Earthquake
Safety Initiative project; see GeoHazards International and United Nations Centre for Regional Devel-
opment (2001). More speciﬁcally, buildings are ﬁrst divided into 9 diﬀerent types.10 Each building type
itself is then rated according to the quality of the design, the quality of construction, and the quality
of materials. Total quality is measured on a scale of zero to seven, depending on the total accumu-
lated points from all three categories. According to the type of building and the total points acquired
through the quality classiﬁcation, each building is then assigned one of nine vulnerability curves which
provides estimates of the percentage of building damage for a set of 28 peak ground acceleration intervals.

    In order to use these vulnerability curves for Indonesia we ﬁrst allocated each of the 99 building types
given in the USGS building inventory to one of the 9 more aggregate categories of the GESI building
classiﬁcation. However, to assign a building type its quality-speciﬁc vulnerability curve we would fur-
ther need to determine its quality in terms of design, construction, and materials, an aspect for which
we unfortunately have no further information. We instead assume that building quality is homogenous
across building type in Indonesia and experiment with seven diﬀerent sets of vulnerability curves, each
set under a diﬀerent quality ratings scenarios (ranging from 0 to 7).

   Figure 8 depicts the building share weighted vulnerability curves of Indonesia for urban and rural
areas.

    To model estimated damage due to a particular earthquake event the data from the ShakeMaps and
GESI are used. Then, one identiﬁes the value of peak ground acceleration that each nightlight cell in
Indonesia experiences by matching each earthquake point with its nearest nightlight cell. If the cell is
further away than 1.5 kilometers or if it experiences shaking (PGA) of less than 0.05 the value is set to 0.
In order to derive at a region j speciﬁc earthquake damage index, ED , the following equation is applied:
                                         I             K
                                                                   pgak,q
                           ED q,j,t =         wi,t−1           DR i,j,k,t        q = 0, . . . , 7                  (7)
                                        i=1            k=1

   where DR is the damage ratio according to the peak ground acceleration, pga , and the urban-rural
qualiﬁcation of cell i, deﬁned for a set of 8 diﬀerent building quality q categories. The weight wi is
the same as before; the sum of the nightlights of the aﬀected cells over the sum of the total provincial
nightlights.


5.1.2    Results
With the above method, we ﬁnd that 27 of the 34 provinces were damaged by earthquakes at some point
in time.11 Table 7 shows that the big islands Java and Sumatra have the most aﬀected nightlight cells,
given how densely populated they are and how much seismic activity is experienced there this is expected.

    Finally, there were 5,251 cases where the instance hit a nightlight cell that was lit. Table 8 shows
that the individual nightlight cell weights are small, as expected, but the impact of having buildings
of quality 4 is that within a cell that is hit, on average a bit more than 6 percent of the buildings are
destroyed.12

   12 We did the same for buildings of quality 0 (the best) and 7 (the worst), something which led to maximum damage

values of 33% for the best buildings and 84% for the worst versus 55% for our base case, showing how the overall damage
is highly dependent on building quality information.

5.1.3   Aggregated data
When aggregating, a similar method as in section 4 is used, but now the aggregation is done directly by
nightlight cells instead of by basin. The equation is:
                                                       L
                                             EDj,t =          ED l,t                                      (8)
                                                          l

where t is year, l is all nightlight cells in the province or district j and ED is the damage from equation 7.

    Table 9 provides the full overview of damage by province, showing the large diﬀerences between the
provinces and how they vary from year to year, as one can expect with highly randomized events such
as earthquakes. Using Yogyakarta - which was only impacted by earthquakes in 2006 - as an example,
there was a loss of 0.4 percent of the total building mass, causing damages estimated to be approxi-
mately 3.1 billion US dollars in addition to more than 5,000 deaths and tens of thousands of injured
and displaced people. Apart from that, provinces on Sumatra make up 6 of the top 10 most damaging
years. Even though Indonesia is often hit by severe earthquakes, even in the worst of years they only
destroy about 1 percent of the buildings in a province. That being said, 1 percent of total building mass
and infrastructure being damaged does constitute a signiﬁcant portion of local budgets. As another
example, the September 2009 earthquake in West Sumatra inﬂicted damages for an estimated 2.3 billion
US dollars, with repair costs and losses of 64 million US dollars on government buildings (Raschky, 2013).

   The numbers per district are shown in Table 10, and they suﬀer much more damage than the provinces,
with the most impacted district losing 5 percent of building mass.

6       Volcano Damage Index
A volcanic eruption consists of ash clouds, pyroclastic ﬂows and lava ﬂows, the latter two which are very
diﬃcult to model without extensive local data. Unfortunately, there is little to no academic research that
has looked into large scale volcanic modeling for all aspects of eruptions. For modeling ash clouds, Joyce
et al. (2009) points to remote sensing through satellite images that detect SO2 emissions as a potential
method.

   To construct a damage index for eruptions, we use a two-fold process. First, volcanic ash advisory
data are used from Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC) to detect eruptions; second, satellite images
containing sulphur dioxide data from the OMI/AURA satellite are used to model the intensity of the
eruptions. The OMI/AURA images have been utilized by Carn et al. (2009) and Ferguson et al. (2010)
to model eruption intensity.


6.1     Volcano Modeling
There are at least two types of software that are used to model eruptions. Voris (Felpeto et al., 2007),
which models ash clouds, lava ﬂows and energy cones, and HYSPLIT from Air Resources Laboratory,
which models air pollution dispersion. Voris relies on highly localized data due to the lava ﬂow and
energy cone modeling, which one will not have in most cases and that does not ﬁt well for large scale
modeling across time and space. HYSPLIT does have batch inputs, but still requires several inputs per
eruption, some which are not easily obtainable.

   The third solution, which is related to the ash clouds mentioned by Joyce et al. (2009), is based oﬀ ash
advisory data to determine whether an eruption happened and OMI/AURA satellite data to determine
the scale of the eruption. This will not help with modeling lava ﬂows and energy cones, but due to the
very localized nature of the ﬂows, there are no good sources or methods to model it for several eruptions
from diﬀerent volcanoes, leaving the ash clouds as a good proxy for all damages.

6.1.1    Ash advisory data
Ash advisories from the Darwin VAAC (DVAAC), which are ash cloud warnings for airplanes, are used
to determine whether an eruption is happening. The warnings show relevant data such as volcano name,
position, summit height, height of clouds and a color code that reﬂects the condition of the air/volcano.
There are 4 diﬀerent codes ranking from the normal state, green, to imminent danger of or ongoing
volcanic eruption, red. Over the period from 2004 until 2015, the DVAAC issued 12,962 warnings and
of these more than 90 percent were either of code red or orange. Data on advisories from code orange
or below were not used, due to eruptions of this scale not being large enough to be properly captured
by the SO2 -data. By limiting the data to code red events, there are 1,785 events spread across 587 dates.13


6.1.2    OMI/AURA Satellite images
To measure the intensity of an eruption, data from the Sulphur Dioxide images of the OMI/Aura
project (Krotkov & Li, 2006) are used. These consist of satellite images from October 2004 and on-
wards. The data have been used to model ash cloud intensity and movement in several articles such as
Carn et al. (2009) and Ferguson et al. (2010).

    The satellite images have a spatial resolution of 13 ∗ 24km and are taken from 80km above ground.
The spectral imaging shows the SO2 vertical column density in Dobson Units and there are 14 or 15
orbits per day, where one orbit covers an area approximately 2,600km wide. A dobson unit is a measure
of density, and at sea level the typical concentration in clean air is less than 0.2DU. The images contain 4
values for column density based on the center of mass altitude (CMA), which is a measure of the altitude
one assumes the center of the distribution is at. There are 4 diﬀerent estimates for the vertical column
density, ranging from 0.9km above ground to 18km above ground.

 13 There   were 571 diﬀerent dates, but some of these dates issued red warnings to 2 or more volcanoes.




                                                            21
    For volcanic activities one normally uses a CMA of either 8km or 18km (OMI team, 2012), where
the former is a middle tropospheric column (TRM) and is for use in medium eruptions, while the latter
is an upper tropospheric and stratospheric column (STL) and is for explosive eruptions. Despite this
diﬀerence, the data are interchangeable in the sense that one can interpolate from one CMA to the others.

   OMI is more sensitive above clouds, which both measures mentioned will normally be. The standard
deviation for both measures is as low as 0.1DU over Indonesia. The data for both STL and TRM are
very similar and this paper uses the STL-data as that are most useful for the biggest events.

6.2     Creation of Damage Index and Results
6.2.1   Damage Index
When constructing a damage index based on SO2 values from ash clouds, one has to set thresholds for
distance from the event and from the centroid of the nightlight cell and also a lower sulphur dioxide-value.
There are no papers or literature that have estimated any parameter values and there are no usable local
data, so the thresholds have been set somewhat arbitrarily.

    First oﬀ, one wants to set a distance threshold estimating how far away the eruption could cause
damage. Note that one wants ground results and not for the aviation industry, since planes can be
aﬀected very far away as evidenced by the total stand still of planes across Europe during the 2010
           okull eruption. We decided to set a very relaxed condition with any point closer than 10
Eyjafjallaj¨
degrees of latitude and longitude included. Figure 9 portrays the plume approximately 7 hours after one
of the biggest Merapi eruptions on 4 November 2010, where the plume moved relatively slowly and after
1000km it dissipated at the lower altitudes, which shows that our 10 degree threshold works well.

    Secondly, to match the nightlight data with the OMI/Aura data, a maximum distance between a
nightlight point and the nearest SO2 point is set at 50km. The SO2 points are fairly scattered due to
cloud covers, hence to get a more consistent grid of nightlight and SO2 values we have chosen a distance
that is approximately two times the longest side of an OMI cell.

   Finally, a minimum SO2 value in Dobson Units is chosen. According to the Belgian Institute for
Space Aeronomy, a typical normal level in air is 0.1DU and a strong eruption is above 10, which is the
threshold value chosen.

    Once the thresholds have been set, the same nightlight weighting method as for our other indices is
applied and then the weights are multiplied with the SO2 value to get an intensity value. The equation
is:

                                           0                  : V SO2 < 10
                               V Di,t =                                                                 (9)
                                           wi,T −1 ∗ VSO2 i   : V SO2 ≥ 10
   where i is the nightlight cell on date t, and wi,T −1 is the previously used weight where i is the
nightlight cell, T − 1 is the nightlight strength from the prior year and it is divided by the sum of total
nightlights in the province or district.

6.2.2   Results
Applying our constraints, the 587 dates with a red warning have been reduced to 16 days. Of these, 7
are from the 2010 eruption on Merapi, the biggest event during the time period.

   Table 11 provides the aﬀected nightlight cells by year and volcano and the results are closely correlated
with the events of the period. The main one is the Merapi eruption in 2010, Soputan with volcanic
explosivity index events of level 2 and 3 in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008 (Global Volcanism Program, 2013)
and Sinabung with several eruptions in 2014, which all ﬁt the model well.

    Table 12 refer to province impacts, and the eruptions aﬀected numerous provinces on Java and Suma-
tra, with Jawa Barat and Jawa Tengah being the most aﬀected with more than 120,000 cells with an
SO2 -value above 10 at some point. This is further underlined by nine of the ten most aﬀected districts
in Table 13 being in these two provinces, which are linked to the Merapi eruption in 2010. Apart from
that, Sulawesi Utara were aﬀected all the years from 2004 through 2008 by the eruptions on Soputan.

    The ﬁnal table in this section, Table 14, provide descriptives of the SO2 variable and the nightlight

20, with a max close to 60, which is 600 times the normal level of 0.1DU SO2 .

6.2.3   Aggregated data
To aggregate the data, the same method as before is applied, with:
                                                       T    I
                                           V Dj,T =             VD i,t                                  (10)
                                                       t    i

   where all days t of year T and all nightlight cells i in province or district j are aggregated.

   The province overview, shown in Table 16, is caused by the Merapi eruption, with 3 of the top 4
being due to that eruption. Jawa Tengah and Yogyakarta are the two most aﬀected provinces, given
their immediate proximity to Merapi. One thing to note is that Jawa Timur, which is east of Merapi,
was hardly aﬀected at all.

   For districts, the Merapi results are even more pronounced, with all districts in the top 10 being from
the 2010 eruption. All the Jawa Tengah districts are west of the volcano. It is somewhat surprising to
ﬁnd that some of the districts in the immediate vicinity of Merapi are not on the list, but this can be
due to the timing and quality of the satellite images. Given the time interval between images, the SO2


                                                       24
clouds could have traveled past the closest districts by the time an image was taken. Regardless, the
results are uniform in that all aﬀected districts are neighbors. Overall, the model seems to give a fair
picture of when and where the eruptions were at their most intense, although the ground level intensity
can be hard to specify.

7       Tsunami Damage Index
The ﬁnal disaster damage index constructed is for the 2004 Christmas tsunami. There is little local dis-
trict level damage data available, so it was decided to use the methodology from Heger (2016), whereby
inundation maps are used to construct a district level damage index assuming a uniform damage across
all ﬂooded areas.


7.1     Creation of Damage Index and Results
7.1.1    Damage Index
Despite all the media coverage and attention the 2004 tsunami had, there is not much detailed spatial
information readily available for research. Heger (2016) has done some research on the causal eﬀects of
the tsunami in his PhD thesis, and we will follow his method closely to model ﬂood impact.

    To construct an inundation map of the aﬀected areas, a map based on MODIS satellite pictures from
Anderson et al. (2004) is used. The map itself is fairly low resolution, but it provides a good overview
of the inundated areas. In terms of the intensity of the ﬂood, there are no existing data on that, but a
uniform ﬂood intensity across all ﬂooded areas is assumed, just as in Heger (2016). The resulting map is
shown in Figure 10, which shows that a large proportion of the Aceh coastline was struck by the tsunami.

    To make this map, the inundation map from DFO was used as a base. Spatial algorithms were
then applied to detect the diﬀerence in color between inundated and non-inundated areas. This process
started with overlaying the base map on a regular shapeﬁle of Indonesia, then detecting the speciﬁc color
of inundated areas, before constructing a new shapeﬁle where all inundated areas (areas with the same
color) have value 1 and all other areas have value 0.



                              Figure 10: Inundation Map of 2004 Tsunami




7.1.2    Results
Figure 11 shows the inundated area nightlight cells, combined with the nightlight cells in all of Aceh. The
tsunami did not strike the most densely populated areas, 460 nightlight cells were hit, out of a total of
13,456 cells in all of Aceh. Given that the tsunami happened 26 December 2004, it is more appropriate to
link the incident with the 2004 nighlights, instead of 2003, as is done for the other disaster types. Using
the 2004 numbers, there were 364 lit inundated cells out of 7,607 total lit cells in Aceh. Interestingly, in
2005, the year after the disaster, there is a strong decline, with 306 and 6,352 lit cells for the inundated


                                                    27
areas and Aceh, respectively. The average light intensity has gone down, from 7.39 per cell to 6.33 in
the inundated areas and from 6.37 to 5.18 in the province as a whole.



                    Figure 11: Aceh Nightlights and Tsunami Aﬀected Nightlights




    Finally, Table 18 shows the weights which are - again - deﬁned as nightlight in the cell over total
nightlight in the province. Although the numbers look very small, by multiplying the means by number
of cells, one gets approximately 5.5 percent. Knowing that the census numbers for Aceh in 2000 gave
a population of just under 4 million and in 2010 of just under 4.5 million and if one multiplies the
population numbers with the aﬀected cells number of 5.5 percent of the total, one gets 221,894 and
249,631, respectively. Given the oﬃcial numbers of 166,671 dead due to the tsunami, an assumption of
total destruction in all inundated areas seem a bit high, given that 166,671 of 230,000 is 72.47 percent.
A damage of 75 percent in the inundated cells is chosen, giving a ﬁnal damage index formula:

                                                      TD i = Wi ∗ D                                 (11)
                                                                                           li
   where TD i is the province weighted damage from nightlight cell i, Wi = I l i.e. the light in cell i
                                                                             i i
over the sum of all nightlight in the province and D is the ﬂat damage number of 0.75.

7.1.3   Aggregated data
Aggregating the data is done using the same method as in all previous sections, where the nightlight
cells across the province or district is summed up:
                                                       I
                                             T Dj =        TD i                                   (12)
                                                       i

   where all nightlight cells i in province or district j are aggregated.

    Since the tsunami only aﬀected one province, it is easy to see the total damage done by it on Aceh.
With our assumptions, the tsunami destroyed about 4 percent of the buildings in Aceh. This is clearer
once broken down into district level damage. There were 6 districts aﬀected by the tsunami, with Aceh
Jaya, Banda Aceh and Pidie all experiencing damage of more than 20 percent. The other 3 aﬀected
districts - Aceh Barat, Aceh Besar and Bireuen - experienced damage between 5 and 10 percent due to
the tsunami.

8    Conclusion
With the continuous increase in remote sourcing data, it has gotten much easier and cheaper to monitor
and assess the damages from natural disasters. Joyce et al. (2009) and Gillespie et al. (2007) have done
an extensive review of how satellite images can be used to map natural disasters, while this paper has
contributed with providing new techniques that utilize other remote sourced data such as ShakeMaps
and ash advisory data.

   Throughout, techniques based on freely available data have been used to construct damage indices for
diﬀerent disaster types. Generally the indices can be used in any area of the world, and if calibrated with
local data, they could provide an excellent tool for local governments or stakeholders in early disaster
assessments.

    The indices can be used to get quick damage estimates and inform where to provide relief, as well as
in research such as what the authors have done in Skouﬁas et al. (2017), where the indices are used to
analyze district budget redistributions following natural disasters.

   The main caveat is the indices have not been validated against local level damage data. If one had
access to high resolution monetary or intensity data, the estimates would be much more precise.

    Table 20 gives an overview of the diﬀerent data sources and software used. All disasters have used
the DMSP global nightlights data to weight the indices based on economic activity. Recently, the VIIRS
nightlight data provide an alternative for assessing economic activity or events, as showcased for GDP in
China (Li et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2014) and Africa (Chen & Nordhaus, 2015) and for storms and ﬂoods
in the US (Cao et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2015). If one is interested in events after 2012, the VIIRS data
provide higher spatial resolution and track changes by month instead of yearly.

    Alternatives do exist for choice of software if one wants everything to be open source and free. Instead
of ArcGIS, packages such as QGIS and RGDAL for R are potential alternatives. R and Python are used
more and more for spatial data and can often provide the necessary tools to do the modeling. Instead of
statistical software such as Matlab and Stata, R and Python once more provide excellent alternatives.
