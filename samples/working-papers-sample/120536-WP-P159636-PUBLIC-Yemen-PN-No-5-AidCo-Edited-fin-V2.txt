                     Box 1: Dual Accountability in Afghanistan and Liberia

Examples from Afghanistan and Liberia show how aid instruments and different degrees of external
oversight and accountability have been used to both build and speed up the transition toward using
country systems:
In Afghanistan, pooled donor financing was used to support state-building process and reconstruction.
The Afghan Interim Authority Fund (AIAF) was established immediately following the liberation to support
recurrent expenditure by the Afghan Interim Authority. The Recurrent Cost Window was carried forward
by the larger Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, jointly set up and managed by the World Bank,
the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and UNDP. RCW started off as quasi-unconditional budget support disbursed
against the submission of expenditure statements that met a set of eligibility criteria related to expenditure
category and compliance with PFM laws and procedures. Eligibility was verified by an Independent
Monitoring Agent (MA), contracted directly by the WB, who acted as additional layer of controls and
monitored, supported, and reported on the efficient and effective implementation of program. While still a
parallel structure, the MA acted as an additional layer of internal rather than external control, thus allowing
it to produce valuable information that was used both to promote financial management and fiduciary
standards and to help the finance ministry and national audit office to meet them. By way of demonstration,
the ARTF’s standards have influenced how the government conducts the control and audit function for
regular public expenditure.
In Liberia, the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP) was a multi-donor
agreement signed by the National Transitional Government in early 2006, along with USAID, the EU, IMF,
WB, African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. GEMAP was based upon the
premise that in order to restore the public trust in government and attract investments, Liberia had to stem
the diversion of state resources, manage public finances transparently, deliver services, and demonstrate
the political will to prosecute corruption. The unique feature of GEMAP (and also the most controversial)
was the placement of international financial controllers in key state-owned enterprises, and experts in the
Ministry of Finance, Bureau of Budget and Treasury. These experts were granted co-signing authority on
spending and were therefore managerial rather than advisory in capacity, as distinct from other public
sector support programs.

 Entities such as SFD and PWP can be critical to quick reengagement of the World Bank once Yemen is
 on a path toward peace. For example, SFD and PWP have a good track record and are well reputed
 as regards their political neutrality, the technical quality of their projects, their contributions to building the
 capacity and quality of local community groups and of small and medium private sector contractors and
 enterprises, all of which are important for Yemen’s recovery and reconstruction. Despite the significant
 impact of security and funding challenges, SFD and PWP, which have well-established community
 networks, continue to operate and adapt to the current environment. SFD and PWP, have strong and
 extensive experience in mitigating risks related to service quality and social accountability. Moreover,
 the implementation capacity and fiduciary arrangements of SFD and PWP have been confirmed by a
 recent UNDP capacity and readiness assessment. Engagement with such groups will help to ensure the
 preserving of local implementation capacity and the resilience of much-needed employment and service
 delivery programs in the post-conflict recovery phase. Furthermore, SFD and PWP have extensive
 experience in labor-intensive works, community-based interventions, and small and micro enterprise
 development.

                 Box 3: Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessments (RPBAs)

 An RPBA is a joint, structured approach to assess and address recovery and peace building requirements in a country
 experiencing conflict or in transition from a conflict-related crisis; it therefore helps to gain a deep understanding of both
 needs and priorities. It has three primary purposes:
 •	        To help governments and their international partners to identify, prioritize and sequence recovery and
 peace building needs, priorities and related activities;
 •	        To provide an inclusive process to support dialogue and participation of stakeholders in the identification
 of recovery and peace building priorities, and resource mobilization; and
 •	        To coordinate international support through a joint assessment exercise and implementation planning.
 An RPBA fits within a broader and long-term process to support countries in conflict or recovering from a conflict-related
 crisis, and should therefore be grounded in a shared understanding of the impact and underlying causes of the conflict. The
 strategic value of the RPBA process is threefold; it provides an evidence-based assessment of recovery and peace building
 requirements, a platform for consensus-building and prioritization, and mechanisms for identifying the implementation and
 financing arrangements required to deliver on these priorities. An RPBA should not be seen as a one-off data collection
 exercise or a sectoral needs assessment, but an on-going process of gathering and analyzing information that can inform the
 response.
 RPBAs are carried out through a three-step process: A pre-assessment is designed to provide some initial guidance
 on the process in order to dt	         ecide whether an RPBA is necessary, and to provide inputs on the scope, objectives and
 institutional arrangements; this stage of the process may also provide an initial indication of the recovery and peace building
 issues to consider if the assessment goes ahead. The second element, assessment, prioritization, and planning includes the
 assessment of recovery and peace building needs and their prioritization in the context of a strategic recovery and peace
 building plan, and is accompanied by a results matrix. It also presents options for implementation (including coordination and
 monitoring arrangements), and financing-related issues. The third element, validation and finalization, focuses on ensuring
 that the plan is agreed upon, and that the necessary arrangements to begin the implementation and financing are in place.

    entity of the Borrower, provided that the APA is consistent with the Core Procurement Principles and
    Anti-Corruption Guidelines of the Bank.

    procurement specialists on the ground.
    Enhanced Bank hands-on implementation support -- available in FCV and low capacity contexts
    Project start-up activities – possibility that those may be carried out by the Bank.
    Principle of “fitness-for-purpose” – allows greater flexibility in designing the procurement procedure
    to take into account applicable objectives and conditions.
    Retroactive financing – procurement must be conducted in a manner consistent with the Core
    Procurement Principles and the governance requirements in Procurement Regulations, within limits
    specified in the Legal Agreement (up to 40% retroactive financing).

           The Somalia Development and Reconstruction Facility (SDRF) was established in 2014 as a
           coordination and financing architecture for implementing the Somali Compact. Closely aligned
           with the Compact’s principles, it serves as a platform for Government and development partners to
           provide strategic guidance and oversight for development activities in Somalia. The SDRF brings
           together several multi-partner trust funds under common governance arrangements administered
           by three technical agencies in areas based on comparative advantage: the UN, the World Bank
           and the African Development Bank. This coordinated financing facility has offered many benefits for
           improving aid effectiveness in Somalia:
               •	 The use of the SDRF pooled funds has helped to strengthen Government ownership and
                   alignment with national priorities. The overall pipeline and specific projects financed through
                   the SDRF are systematically brought through working groups and the Steering Committee
                   for discussion and endorsement.
               •	 The pooling of resources through the SDRF generates economies of scale, and has allowed
                   donors better leverage of their contributions through more coordinated assistance, avoiding
                   fragmentation and duplication.
               •	 A joint risk management strategy has been established to support the delivery of the SDRF
                   strategic objectives. By sharing the analysis and management of risk, Government, donors
                   and the fund administrators are able to respond to the substantial risks of engaging in Somalia
                   in a way that is more effective in meeting the goals of the Somali Compact
