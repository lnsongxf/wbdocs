Baseline Report
FEED THE FUTURE NIGERIA LIVELIHOODS PROJECT 1
November 2016

Abstract
This report analyzes data for the Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project impact evaluation baseline survey. The
baseline survey was completed before the start of the rainy season between May 2015 and June 2015 in Kebbi State
in northern Nigeria. This report provides an overview of the sampling methodology and baseline survey
administration, as well as an analytical profile of the poverty status, demographic characteristics, land ownership and
employment choices of the vulnerable households surveyed. It also presents data analysis of an adapted version of the
Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI).
Feed the Future strives to increase agricultural production and the incomes of both men and women in rural areas who
rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Consistent with the targeting for the program, the study sample is made up of
rural, farming households, with 80% of the surveyed population naming crop and animal production as their primary
income activity. Eighty-five percent of households in the study sample fall below the international USD 1.25/day
poverty line based on a measure of daily expenditures per capita. Nineteen percent of households reportedly faced
food insecurity within the past 12 months. Unemployment is high in the study population, with 37% of the sample
reporting no persons within their household worked at an income-generating activity in the past 30 days prior to the
baseline survey. In terms of agricultural land ownership, 55% of the households in the sample reported owning at least
one plot of agricultural land; self-reported average land size was 3.3 hectares. Only 15 percent of surveyed women
were defined as empowered based on a measure of the adapted WEAI.

       1 Introduction
       The World Bank’s Africa Region Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) is conducting an impact evaluation of the
       Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project (FNLP) that was formerly called the Support to Vulnerable
       Households for Accelerated Revenue Earnings (SHARE) project. FNLP is a multi-component development
       project based on the graduation model pioneered by Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC)
       that intends to help 42,000 very poor households across rural communities of northern Nigeria’s Sokoto
       and Kebbi states, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). FNLP is a 5-year program implemented by
       Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Both the program and the impact evaluation are funded by United States
       Agency for International Development (USAID).
       This program approach is founded on an agriculture-led growth strategy that is expected to help vulnerable
       families diversify their income and grow assets while the community is strengthened by improving
       nutrition, water sanitation, and hygiene. The most vulnerable families receive cash transfers. A caseworker-
       led livelihood mentoring scheme also matches households with the resources they need to engage
       effectively in the local economy and break free from the cycle of poverty and malnutrition.
       Figure 1 outlines the major components and subcomponents of this project and the three experiments being
       conducted as part of an impact evaluation; a more detailed discussion of all the program components can
       be found in the impact evaluation concept note and the project proposal document.2

Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project Impact Evaluation                                Baseline Report

FNLP was designed to rollout in three phases, classes A, B, and C in 2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively. In
total, 12,000 households in 104 villages are expected to receive the program in Kebbi State, where this
impact evaluation is being conducted. The baseline data presented in this report was collected from a subset
of these households. Outside the scope of this impact evaluation, CRS is providing services to an additional
30,000 households in Sokoto State and FCT as part of this project.
The impact evaluation is designed to capture the outcomes of three different experiments (see Figure 1).
The first experiment evaluates the village level impact of the FNLP. The second and third experiments
evaluate household-level impacts of two important sub-components: a caseworker-led mentoring program
focused on livelihood planning, called the caseworker model, and an unconditional cash transfers
program for women in extremely vulnerable households. The components evaluated in each experiment are
highlighted in Figure 1 and discussed in greater detail in Section 2.
The identification of program beneficiaries for this program in Kebbi drew heavily from lessons learned in
the ultra-poor graduation pilots3. Beneficiary households were selected through a multi-stage process
involving the identification of vulnerable communities, followed by a community-based identification of
vulnerable households and finally the use of a version of the “Progress out of Poverty Index” (PPI) to rank
relative vulnerability. Households were stratified into three vulnerability categories, which were defined
based on the distribution of the PPI score within each LGA ward. The category definitions are provided in
Table 1 and discussed further in Section 3.
                                    Table 1: Vulnerability Category Definitions
                        Vulnerability Category            Vulnerability Percentiles a
                        Extremely Vulnerable (EV)         Bottom 16 percentiles
                        Very Vulnerable (VV)                   17th to 85th percentile
                        Market Limited (ML)                    Top 15 percentiles
                        Note: (a) Vulnerability distributions were stratified by ward.

In FNLP villages, households in all three vulnerability categories are eligible to benefit from all the program
components except the caseworker model and the cash transfers. The caseworkers are randomly assigned
to half the households in FNLP villages across all three vulnerability categories. The cash transfers are also
randomly assigned to women in half of the EV households in all eligible villages.
The baseline data that are the basis of this report were collected in preparation for the program rollout in
Kebbi State between May 2015 and June 2015. The objective of the baseline survey was to build a
comprehensive dataset that would serve as a reference point before program implementation commenced.
The survey was designed and supervised by GIL and executed by TNS-RMS, a Nigerian survey firm. This
document discusses the overall design of the impact evaluation in Section 2, the sampling methodology in
Section 3, a description of the baseline survey field operations in Section 4, summary statistics from the
baseline data in Section 5, and conclusions in Section 6.

2 Impact Evaluation Design
The design described in this section allows us to identify independent and joint overall effects for all of the
FNLP program, and for two sub-components: the caseworker model and the cash transfers. The design was
developed through extensive discussions with the implementation team (CRS) and the program funders
(USAID) to identify institutional and project-specific learning objectives. This is a complex impact
evaluation composed of three main experiments:
      E1. Village-level impacts of FNLP
      E2. Household-level impacts of caseworker mentoring
      E3. Household-level impacts of varying the size of cash transfers
The structure of the experiments and their inter-relationship is laid out in Figure 2 and summarized in this
section.4 In Figure 2, the experimental groups are displayed in boxes and non-experimental groups in box
brackets. Treatment groups are in solid-lined boxes shaded green, and control groups are in broken-lined
boxes shaded orange. Each experimental group is also marked for which experiment they are related to in
the list above.

2.1.1 Experiment 1: Village-level Impacts of FNLP
In the first experiment, half the eligible villages identified by the implementer, as described in Section 3.1
below, were randomly selected to receive the FNLP intervention; the other half of the villages will not
receive the FNLP interventions5. This clustered experiment allows us to identify the overall effect of the
program on beneficiary households inside eligible villages since treated households and non-treated
households will be in different villages. Clustering also reduces the risk that non-treated households might
indirectly benefit from FNLP, minimizing spillover effects.

2.1.2 Experiment 2: Household-level Impacts of Caseworker Mentoring
The evaluation of the caseworker model will examine the impact of the livelihood planning and mentoring
program on reducing vulnerability especially through the take-up of other FNLP and public services
available to households. Local female volunteers trained by CRS, known as liaisons, provide the in-home
mentoring. Beneficiary households are trained to plan their livelihoods and manage their income to help
them graduate out of poverty. Liaisons will also facilitate women’s caregiver groups, focused on life skills
like hygiene and family planning.
The caseworker experiment allows us to identify the incremental effect of livelihood mentoring on
households in FNLP villages. All vulnerable households in the treatment villages were eligible to receive
caseworkers. Within each vulnerability category, half the households were randomly selected to receive an
in-home mentoring from a trained community volunteer. Households that do not receive this additional
program continue to be eligible for other FNLP services offered in the village. Since households were
randomized within villages, this experiment will not be able to account for spillovers across households.

2.1.3 Experiment 3: Household-level Impacts of Varying the Size of Cash Transfers
The cash transfers evaluation will assess the impact of providing unconditional cash transfers to women in
extremely vulnerable households. Livelihood choices, intra-household decision-making, consumption
smoothing, investments, and savings are amongst outcomes of interest for this experiment. This experiment
will be provided to the poorest households in both FNLP treatment and control villages.
Half of the eligible households will receive the transfers. The recipient households will be equally divided
into two groups. The first group will receive fifteen monthly payments. The others group will receive five
quarterly payments over the same fifteen-month time frame. Both groups will receive a total of NGN 71,500
(approximately USD 350 based on the October 2015 exchange rate).
Varying the frequency and size of the transfers may impact the allocation of the new resources between
consumption and investment. Understanding the differential impact on these two groups is expected to
provide important policy insights especially since high transaction costs are a barrier to scale-up.
This design allows us to assess both the incremental impact of receiving cash transfers in FNLP villages,
as well as the pure effect of receiving just cash transfers without the accompanying FNLP programs. As
with Experiment 2, since the treated and control households are within the same villages, we are not able
to experimentally account for spillovers.

    However, the cash transfer program is given to extremely vulnerable households even in FNLP control villages.

3 Beneficiary Identification & Sample Selection
To determine which areas within Kebbi State would benefit from the FNLP program and to establish a
sample of vulnerable households that will be part of the program and impact evaluation, CRS and GIL
identified eligible communities and households in Kebbi using a number of steps. Detailed explanations of
each stage in the process are provided in the subsequent sections.
This section discusses activities related both to the impact evaluation as well as the program
implementation. As in other parts of this document, when we refer to activities conducted by CRS or in
collaboration with CRS we are referring to activities that were essential for program implementation but
had a strong bearing on the impact evaluation design, execution and validity.


3.1 Beneficiary Targeting and Categorization
3.1.1 Identifying Vulnerable Households
A four-step strategy was utilized to target the most vulnerable households in the sample area. FNLP’s
targeting strategy was based on the approach used by the ultra-poor graduation pilot programs. The
beneficiary targeting and identification strategy is summarized in Table 2 and explained in detail in the
remainder of this section.
                               Table 2: FNLP’s Beneficiary Targeting Strategy
 # Step                         Description
 1 Selecting program areas      The program implementer identified the program areas, i.e. the state, local
                                government areas (LGAs) and eligible villages.
 2 Community identification     Village communities were mobilized to conduct a participatory poverty
   of vulnerable households     appraisal to identify vulnerable households.
 3 Measuring poverty using      A poverty measurement survey was conducted using the Progress out of
   the PPI                      Poverty Index (PPI) to measure the poverty of households identified in Step 2.
 4 Verifying vulnerability      The vulnerability status of households was determined based on their PPI
   status                       scores. Ineligible households were dropped from the beneficiaries list.

Selecting Program Areas: Out of the 21 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Kebbi State, Birnin Kebbi and
Danko Wasagu were selected through a competitive bidding process based on Expressions of Interest
solicited by CRS in collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, and the
Kebbi State Chapter of the Association of Local Governments Nigeria (ALGON). The applications were
evaluated by CRS and MLGCA based on the following criteria: above-average population size, largely
rural population, wide geographic spread, administrative capacity to offer services and commitment to the
cash transfer program.
The selection of these two LGAs was unanimously endorsed by the 21 LGA chairpersons representing
ALGON. The Kebbi State Ministries of Agriculture & Natural Resources, and Women Affairs & Social
Development also provided approval for this selection.
A CRS team was tasked with identifying four wards and at least 50 villages in each of the LGAs. Birnin
Kebbi has a total of fifteen wards, and Danko Wasagu has eleven. The FNLP wards were selected based on
the existence of a substantial vulnerable population, and logistical considerations about program monitoring

                                               Page 10 of 64

and service delivery. Villages needed to have more than 250 households to be considered for inclusion in
the program, however, smaller hamlets that were very close to large villages were also considered. CRS
also consulted the National Population Commission of Nigeria to help estimate the village populations and
attempt to estimate the concentration of vulnerable households in each village.
The eight FNLP wards that were finally selected by CRS were: Ujariyo/Junju, Lagga/Randalli, Kardi and
Makera/Maurida in Birnin Kebbi; and Kanya, Ribah/Waje, Maga/Kyabu and Danko in Danko Wasagu.

Based on the field work and secondary data, 132 village names were identified in the eight FNLP wards
that potentially had the approximately 24,000 households that were needed to meet FNLP program and
impact evaluations targets. Eleven village names were dropped from this list when the field team was not
able to identify them on the ground. The remaining 121 villages were visited by CRS and the survey firm
to hold a Household Targeting Committee (HTC) meeting that had the task of listing all the households
considered vulnerable in that particular village.
Community Identification of Vulnerable Households: Drawing lessons from the ultra-poor graduation
program’s targeting methodology, FNLP used a community-driven approach to identify vulnerable
households. CRS convened a Household Targeting Committee (HTC) in each of the 121 FNLP villages.
The following community stakeholders were invited to be part of the committees: the village heads and
their counselors, religious leaders, health workers, farmers’ group leaders, teachers, youth leaders, women
leaders, and agricultural extension workers. HTC meetings were generally held at the Traditional Ruler’s
palace which is typically a hut building located in the center of the village.
 CRS provided the following guidance about the characteristics of vulnerable households to the HTC:
“Vulnerable households are households that have low income, they have few assets (like TVs, radios,
bicycles or hoes), and they own less than one acre of land. They probably eat only a few times per day, and
eat meat only very rarely. Vulnerable households might also have children out of school, people too sick to
work, or very old. They might also have many babies or pregnant women.”

Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project Impact Evaluation                                  Baseline Report

The HTC was invited to discuss the characteristics of what might constitute vulnerability in their local
context and meet by itself (without CRS) to list out the vulnerable households in their communities. During
the course of the HTC exercise, three more village-names were dropped from the list because two of them
were names of neighborhoods in other listed villages, while one was an alias for another village already on
the list. The hand-written lists produced by the HTCs of 118 villages were digitized by the survey firm and
became the sample frame for the PPI.
Measuring Poverty using the PPI: The Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI)6 is a poverty measurement tool
composed of 20 questions about household demographics, health, human capital and assets. The higher the
PPI score of a household the more vulnerable it is deemed to be. The PPI data was collected from 18,272
households in 116 villages7.
Verifying Household Vulnerability Status: Any household that received a score of less than 8 on four food
security measures in the PPI were deemed insufficiently vulnerable to be included in the FNLP, as were
households with an overall PPI score of less than 25. Only 209 households were excluded from the program
based on this criterion.

3.1.2 Vulnerability Categorization
To simplify the implementation of the cash transfers, CRS agreed that all the cash transfers would be given
in the ‘Class B’ rollout. Since a sample size of approximately 2,400 vulnerable households was required
according to the power calculations (See Box 1 for details), the Extremely Vulnerable (EV) category was
defined as the most vulnerable 16 percentiles of households in each ward (i.e. those with the highest PPI
scores) which added up to 2,400 households across Kebbi State.
Very Vulnerable (VV) households were defined as the 17th to 85th most vulnerable percentiles, and Market
Limited (ML) households were the 15 least vulnerable percentiles based on the PPI.
It was logistically infeasible to provide cash transfers in villages with less than 18 EV households. This
resulted in 256 EV households in 31 villages being excluded from the cash transfers, but they continue to
be eligible for other FNLP services since the total number of vulnerable households make overall FNLP
coverage feasible.


3.2 Randomization
The implementation of the impact evaluation design strategy for each of the experiments summarized above
in Figure 2 is described here.
Experiment 1: Village Randomization
Some of the 104 villages that were found to be eligible to receive FNLP were geographically very close to
each other, increasing the risks of program spillovers if they were inadvertently assigned to different

    The PPI survey questionnaire is included as an attachment to this report.

  The village chiefs of Danguntu village in Maga/Kyabu ward of Danko Wasagu LGA and Tungar Maifada village
in Lagga/Randalli ward of Birnin Kebbi LGA refused the PPI survey since it was being conducted in the run-up to
the Nigerian presidential election.
                                                      Page 12 of 64

treatment arms. To reduce this risk, villages that were either within a ½ mile (.802 km) radius of one another,
or were within a ½ mile of each other by road, were grouped together. 14 villages were affected by this
criteria, and were assembled into 6 village groups. 90 villages were unaffected by this criteria, leaving us
with 96 randomization units.
To maximize statistical power, by ensuring that similar villages were included in the treatment and control
groups, the village randomization was stratified by ward and an infrastructure index, used as a proxy for
the development of the village. The infrastructure index was created by counting the number of
infrastructure items8 that existed in each village based on data collected using the Community
Questionnaire. The villages were then divided into terciles (or thirds) within each ward based on their
location in the distribution of infrastructure index scores. Table 3 shows the number of villages in each
ward/infrastructure-tercile cell. Villages were randomized into treatment and control within each cell.

The FNLP village-level experiment includes 104 villages comprising 12,146 households. Of these, 52 are
treatment villages (with 6,094 households) and the other 52 are control villages (with 6,052 households).
Based on the grouping strategy described above, this is equivalent to 96 randomization units, with 50
treatment units (2 village groups & 48 villages) and 46 control units (4 village groups & 42 villages).

    Box 1: Phased Program Rollout
    FNLP was designed to be rolled out in three annual phases, which is how it was implemented in Sokoto State and
    FCT. However, in Kebbi State, FNLP was started a year later than in the other areas, so the program was adjusted
    to be rolled out in two annual phases: ‘Class B’ began in June 2015, and ‘Class C’ was planned for 2016.
    In total, CRS intends to reach 12,000 vulnerable households in Kebbi State through FNLP. To ensure that there
    would be a sufficient number of households to form the control group in the impact evaluation, the initial target
    was to identify 24,000 vulnerable households. 18,272 vulnerable households were identified, after PPI data
    collection in 116 villages.



8
  The infrastructure index was computed by giving the village a score of one for having at least one of each of the
following 16 items: primary school, secondary school, health center, hospital, doctor, midwife, pharmacy, airtime or
cellphone distributor, bus stop, main access road, bank, microfinance institution, police station, market, mosque or
church and community center.

 From amongst the villages randomly selected to receive FNLP, GIL assisted CRS in randomly assigning 6,094
 vulnerable households to ‘Class B’; 2,382 households were assigned to ‘Class C’ within the FNLP treatment
 villages. CRS intends to conduct additional recruitment of households and villages to reach its total target of 12,000
 households in Kebbi State. Similar top-up recruitment was also conducted in Sokoto State and FCT.
 Nine villages with less than 30 vulnerable households, a large village with 1,594 vulnerable households and two
 other villages where PPI data was not verifiable, were not included in the impact evaluation. GIL provided the list
 of these households to CRS, who may decide to offer FNLP to the 2,094 vulnerable households in these villages in
 ‘Class C’. 104 villages were left to be randomized, a process that is described later in this section.

Experiment 2: Caseworker Randomization
All households in the FNLP treatment villages selected in the randomization for Experiment 1 were eligible
to be included in the randomization for Experiment 2. Of the 6,094 vulnerable households in the 52 FNLP
treatment villages, half (3,047 vulnerable households) were randomly selected to receive the caseworker-
led livelihood mentoring treatment. The remaining 3,047 vulnerable households will not receive the
caseworker treatment. However, they will be eligible for other FNLP services being offered in the village.
Treatment assignment was stratified by vulnerability category so the vulnerability profile of the caseworker
treatment group will be similar to that of the control group as shown in Table 4. All households in the
treatment villages in ‘Class B’ of the program rollout were randomly assigned to either the 'caseworker' or
'no caseworker' treatment arms. Comparing these two groups will allow us to evaluate the incremental effect
of the caseworker mentoring scheme on program impact.

3.2.1 Experiment 3: Cash Transfer Randomization
A public lottery was utilized to randomly assign eligible households in the Extremely Vulnerable (EV)
category in both the FNLP treatment and FNLP control villages. Eight ward-level public randomization
ceremonies were organized at the residence of the ward chiefs. Community representatives from each
village were invited to participate in the event. CRS and GIL representatives explained the cash transfer
program and the randomization process to all present at the beginning of the ceremony. Four containers
were placed at the front of the assembled group: one marked “Monthly Cash Transfers,” one marked
“Quarterly Cash Transfers,” and two marked “No Cash Transfers.” The order of the containers for each
ward-level ceremony was randomized by GIL in advance of the ceremony. Paper slips containing the names
of all eligible households were placed before the assembly. Members of the audience would come up to
the front, draw out a slip, read out the name and village, and place it in the next unused container while
announcing the treatment assignment. After all the containers had been cycled through, they would circle
back to the first and continue till all the names were assigned to a treatment arm. Each EV household had
a 50% chance of receiving a cash transfer. The results of the treatment assignment are tabulated in Table 5.

3.3 Baseline Sampling & Power Analysis
For the Impact Evaluation baseline survey, a sample of 2,400 EV households and 1,100 households equally
divided between the VV and ML households was necessary based on power calculations. We sampled 2,074
of the ‘Class B’ households in FNLP treatment villages and 2,254 from FNLP control villages and sent this
sample of 4,328 households to the survey firm to conduct a baseline survey. The number of household
interviews completed was 3,976 for a household response rate of 92 percent (see section 4.6 for more detail
on survey non-response).

 Box 2: Statistical Power Analysis
 For the cash transfers experiment (Experiment 3), budgetary constraints limited the sample size to approximately
 600 beneficiary households in treatment villages and another 600 beneficiaries in the control villages. All extremely
 vulnerable (EV) households were eligible for cash transfers. Adding an equal number of non-cash transfer
 households raised the sample size to 1,200 in each arm of the village level experiment. These households are spread
 over 104 villages; however, the sample is stratified by 96 village groups. Some smaller or geographically indistinct
 villages were grouped with larger neighbors by the implementer for logistical efficiency.
 Since the sample size is programmatically fixed for the cash transfer experiment, we conducted a sensitivity
 analysis to find the minimum detectable effect sizes at 80% power. With a sample of 1,200 households we are
 powered to detect: 32-36% changes in income, 8-9% changes in hours worked, and 40-45% changes in nutrition.
 With a sample of 2,400, i.e. including the FNLP control village sample, we are powered to detect slightly smaller
 effects: 26-30% changes in income, 7-8% changes in hours worked and 32-38% changes in household nutrition.
 The caseworker mentoring experiment (Experiment 2) includes the very vulnerable (VV) and market limited
 (ML) groups in addition to the extremely vulnerable (EV). All households in FNLP villages within each of these
 groups were randomized in this experiment. In determining the sample size required for data collection, first, we
 included the cash transfer sample of 1,200 households for whom we are already collecting data. The cash transfer
 sample is, in fact, the entire population of EV households within the FNLP villages. Power calculations indicated
 that roughly 550 additional households needed to be sampled, equally distributed over the VV and ML groups, with
 half receiving the caseworker treatment. With a combined sample size of 1,750, stratified by 48 village groups, the
 study is powered to detect effects in the range of 24-27% changes in income, 6-7% changes in hours worked, and
 30-34% changes in household nutrition for the caseworker intervention.
 Finally, for the village-level FNLP experiment (Experiment 1), mirroring the stratified sample of 1,750 from the
 FNLP treatment villages in the FNLP control villages gives us a total sample size of 3,500 households for the
 village-level experiment. The random assignment is clustered at the village-group level into 96 clusters. The sample
 is composed of 69% EV (2,400 households), and 550 households each in the VV and ML groups. Given this sample,
 we are powered to detect 18-24% changes on income, 5-6% changes in the number of hours worked and 23-28%
 changes in household nutrition.
 Appendix C of the Concept Note provides a detailed technical discussion about these power calculations.

4 Baseline Survey Implementation
4.1 Questionnaire Design
The survey questionnaire created for the FNLP baseline survey draws on a number of sections from the
World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS). For the baseline survey, three instruments
were used for data collection:
      1. Household questionnaire: The household questionnaire was administered to all households in the
         sample and collected demographic characteristics for all household members, information on
         dwelling characteristics, household consumption expenditures, household asset holdings,
         aspirations, exposure to shocks, and level of participation in safety net programs. In addition,
         individual-level questions around food security, risk aversion, and time preferences were asked to
         both the male and female decision-makers in the households.
      2. Women’ questionnaire: Women were also asked to respond to a separate Women’s Survey that
         had questions based on the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI).
      3. Agricultural questionnaire: An agriculture questionnaire was administered to all households
         engaged in agricultural activities such as crop farming, livestock rearing and other agricultural and
         related activities. The instrument asked questions on land holdings, agriculture production, sales,
         agricultural income and level of participation in extension services programs. Plot-level
         information was collected from the male and female decision-makers in the households who were
         the target respondents for this questionnaire.
      4. Community questionnaire: A community questionnaire was administered to each village to collect
         information on the socio-economic indicators of the village communities where the sampled
         households reside. The community questionnaire collected information on basic characteristics of
         the community such as location, size, distance to larger towns and markets, and availability of and
         distance to sources of health services and schools. Data was collected from 5-10 community
         members during the Household Targeting Committee meetings.
The survey questionnaires are provided as an attachment to this baseline report.9

4.2 Country Approvals and Informed Consent Process
In line with World Bank Group procedures and in consultation with the USAID Nigeria Mission, the project
received ethical clearances to conduct the baseline survey from the Permanent Secretaries of the Kebbi
State Ministries of Agriculture & Natural Resources, and Local Government & Chieftaincy Affairs.
The documents that were submitted to obtain approval were the project concept note, baseline survey
questionnaire, a script to establish informed consent and a cover letter. The cover letter introduced the
parties involved in the project, provided assurance that all personal data collected will be kept confidential,
and outlined the objectives of the research to facilitate the design of more effective policies on agricultural

interventions for ultra-poor households. The FNLP Kebbi State coordinator helped the impact evaluation
team navigate the country approval application process by following up with government officials.


4.3 Interviewer Training and Piloting
The survey firm contracted by GIL to collect the baseline data, TNS-RMS (a Nigerian survey firm with
headquarters based in Lagos, Nigeria), recruited 40 interviewers and 8 supervisors for the baseline survey.
TNS-RMS initially began the classroom training with 59 interviewers, but a number were dropped based
on quality concerns.

4.3.1 Interviewer Training
Interviewers were trained using the paper version of the questionnaire for 3 weeks and an additional week
was spent studying the questionnaire in electronic format. The interviewers also conducted pilot surveys on
the tablet computers10 in villages outside of the impact evaluation sample. The GIL team also assessed the
interviewers by ranking their interviewing skills and knowledge of the questionnaires. The 40 interviewers
who were sent to the field were found to have good or excellent skills to effectively conduct the survey;
those with poor skills were dismissed. Interviewers were assigned to smaller groups, and each group of 5
interviewers was expected to complete 15 interviews a day to ensure the baseline survey was completed
before program implementation.

4.3.2 Hausa Translation
All the questionnaires were developed in English, and translated into the Hausa language commonly spoken
throughout Northern Nigeria. TNS-RMS, the survey firm contracted a local linguist to translate the baseline
questionnaires from English into Hausa. A supervisor at TNS-RMS reviewed the translated questionnaire
before the interviewer training. The English and Hausa versions of each question were also reviewed side-
by-side during the training to ensure that the interviewers properly understood the context and meaning of
the questions they were going to ask. Both the English and Hausa versions of the questionnaire and
accompanying prompts and scripts were included in the electronic version of the questionnaire. Since there
are a number of language dialects in this region, the interviewers were trained on the context of the question
so that, where necessary, the interviewers could draw on different dialects to ensure the question was fully
understood by the respondent.

4.3.3 Questionnaire Piloting
The pilot surveys that were conducted ahead of data collection provided good practice for the interviewers
and allowed the team to identify issues before the main data collection started. During the pilot, the team
faced challenges with the tablet computers because it was very hot in Kebbi at 43 degrees Celsius. The
performance of the tablets was affected by the heat, including through reductions in expected battery life.
The survey firm sent power banks from Lagos to help increase the battery life of the tablet computers.
During the pilot survey, the average time taken to complete an interview was four-and-quarter hours.



10
   Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablets, running Android OS were used for this survey. The surveys were programmed
and administered using SurveyCTO’s online platform as a back-end and the SurveyCTO Collect Android app as the
front-end.
                                               Page 17 of 64
Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project Impact Evaluation                            Baseline Report

However, the interviewers were retrained on sections about Economic Shocks, Risk Aversion and
Hyperbolic Discounting which were taking longer to administer. The additional practice helped reduce the
total time taken to complete an interview to two-and-half hours before baseline data collection commenced.
During the pilot, it was found that households were not receptive to having a male interviewer interview
female respondents. To rectify this, female interviewers conducted the women’s interview at the end of the
visit to the household in cases where the male interviewer was not well-received.


4.4 Baseline Survey Data Collection
Although data collection was originally planned to begin in February, restrictions related to Federal and
State elections throughout Nigeria led to the survey and the program implementation being delayed. The
data collection finally started on May 4th in Birnin Kebbi and continued to Danko Wasagu concluding on
June 16th 2015.
Since the households interviewed during the baseline survey were selected from the PPI database, some of
the supervisors and interviewers had already visited the locality prior to the baseline data collection and
locating households was easier as a result.
The male and female decision-makers in the household completed the survey together unless there was only
one decision-maker in the household. The respondents are those which are self-identified as the primary
male and female members responsible for the decision making, both social and economic decisions mainly
related to agriculture, within the household. If only one of these people were available at the time of the
first visit, interviewers would complete the sections relevant to them and a second visit would be
rescheduled for when the other was in attendance to complete the survey.
The questionnaires were administered in face-to-face interviews in the respondents’ home, using tablet
computers. Many of the female respondents in Kebbi were not permitted to come out of their homes to
answer questions; in such cases, female interviewers were permitted access to their homes. The field teams
worked to ensure that this challenge was minimized by having enough female interviewers as part of each
team.
In some cases, power failure due to the hot and dry climate increased the duration of the interview by one
to two hours. In such cases, the interviewers were encouraged to conduct the interviews in shaded areas
away from direct sunlight when interviewing respondents in an effort to preclude such adverse outcomes.
Some interviews were also conducted in the early morning or late afternoon to mitigate this challenge. In
addition, power banks and paper questionnaires were employed in cases where power was an issue.
TNS-RMS worked with CRS to ensure that the baseline data collection activities were completed before
program implementation began. This was a concern because the program needed to start before the start of
planting season, which varied across the sample by location and crop mix.


4.5 Data Quality Assurance
Data quality was ensured at several levels. At the tablet level, the questionnaire was programmed so that
questions or sections could not be skipped by interviewers. Numerous quality checks were also built into
the programming that identified inconsistencies and prevented interviewers from moving forward with the

                                              Page 18 of 64
Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project Impact Evaluation                                  Baseline Report

survey until errors were corrected. Logic checks and range checks were also included in the programming
so that implausible entries were flagged to the interviewer at the time of surveying.
Monitoring of data collection activities was also conducted by several people. Supervisors monitored
interviewer performance by observing interviews and conducting spot checks that consisted of assessing
whether questions were being asked appropriately and providing immediate feedback to interviewers. The
World Bank’s Project Manager and Field Coordinator also provided another layer of quality control,
visiting each interviewer team at least twice each week to observe interviews and review household listings.
A final level of data quality control involved the use of quality control reports that were automatically
generated using a quality-check file created by the research team at the World Bank. The file would scan
the data for possible errors or large outliers as soon as data was downloaded from the server. The types of
checks the file would make included the following: whether the household identifiers were unique within
the dataset, whether interviews were being completed in their entirety, reviewing observations with
duplicate values of a variable for which duplicates are uncommon, checking that no variables have only
missing values, checking important skip patterns, range checks and interviewer comments. This helped
with data accuracy as the report was reviewed at least every week by the research team throughout the data
collection period and any errors could be sent back to the field team and rectified in real time while the data
collection was still taking place.


4.6 Survey Non-Completion Rates
The final number of households surveyed was 3,976 (2772 EV households, 958 VV households, and 246
ML households). The survey non-completion rate for the full sample was 8% with no replacement
households. The non-completion rates were fairly balanced across control and treatment groups at 9% and
7%, respectively. Non-response was due mainly to the selected household being away on travel, the
household not being found, and refusal. Table 6 tabulates the baseline survey non-completion rate by
vulnerability category while Table 7 tabulates the rate by FNLP village treatment and control status.

5 Baseline Study Results
The characteristics of FNLP baseline respondents are analyzed in this section. The main objective of the
baseline survey is to establish a comprehensive dataset that can serve as a benchmark for the endline impact
analysis. Understanding respondents’ individual and household characteristics, as well as agricultural
practices, can provide valuable insights when seeking to understand any changes caused by the
interventions. Quantitative data analysis was conducted in Stata (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas).
Analysis in this baseline report includes basic descriptive statistics and some statistical testing of mean
differences to test for balance across the treatment and comparison groups. Indicators are reported primarily
as either percentages or means. Emphasis has been placed on presenting averages for the entire population
and by splitting the data across vulnerability categories (EV, VV and ML classifications) as well as across
the two LGAs where appropriate. In Appendix C, we also include information collected from a field
assessment that the research team conducted in Kebbi prior to the baseline survey.

Figures 4 and 5 are satellite maps taken from Google Earth that show visually how the two LGAs landscape
differ, with Birnin Kebbi having a much drier climate than Danko Wasagu. However, the villages in Danko
Wasagu LGA were found to be more isolated and less connected to infrastructure than the villages in the
Birnin Kebbi LGA.11

5.2 Household Demographics
5.2.1 Gendered Household Type
Feed the Future purposely does not use the concepts of male-headed and female-headed households, which
are fraught with difficulties and assumptions about “headship” (see Buvinić and Rao Gupta 1997;
Budlender 2003; Deere, Alvarado, and Twyman 2012)12. The concept of “head of household” is highly
loaded, presumes certain characteristics that may or may not be present in household gender dynamics, and
often reflects the bias of the researcher or respondent. In addition, the “head of household” concept may
perpetuate existing social inequalities and prioritization of household responsibilities that may be
detrimental to women. Rather, Feed the Future classifies households in terms of whether there are both
male and female adults (dual-adult households), only female adults, or only male adults.
The gender composition of the households in the sample were classified into the following categories:
households with both male and female adults (dual adult); households with a male adult but no female adult
(male adult only); and households with female adult but no male adult (female adult only). The question on
gendered household type was asked directly to the female decision maker in the household; for the 3% of
households where this information was missing we imputed the information using the household roster.
The percentage of dual adult households in the sample is 80%, the percentage of female adult only

Adults were defined as any individuals in the household who are age 18 years or older. Therefore, dual
adult households could be made up of husband and wife couples, or with single men or women living with
older children; they could also be comprised of more than two adults. For the purposes of the survey, the
primary male and female decision-makers in the household were identified to answer the questionnaire,
unless there was only one decision-maker in the household. The primary and secondary respondents are
those which are self-identified as the primary members responsible for the decision making, both social and
economic decisions, within the household. In polygamous households, where wives occupy one housing
unit together, the female primary decision-maker was identified by the household. In cases where the wives
live in separate housing units within the same compound or in different compounds– each wife was
interviewed separately and classified as separate households. This followed the program approach that
acknowledged that wives living in separate housing units are likely to have different budgets and so should
be considered separate households.

5.2.2 Household Size
The average household size in the sample is 5 members. The average number of offspring is 3 and average
number of children below the age of 15 years is 2.7.

In the following analysis, the primary decision-maker could be male or female depending on the person
who was identified as the “household head” in the household roster section of the survey. The average age
of the primary decision-maker for the entire sample is 45 years; 84% report being currently married. The
prevalence of polygamous marriage is 23% and widow status is 12% for the total sample. Literacy rates
(self-reported “yes” to be able to read and write in any language) among primary decision-makers is 39%.
School attendance (self-reported “yes” to ever attending a school) of the primary decision-maker is 12%
with an additional 26% primary decision-makers reporting having received some form of Quranic study in

the past. Further breakdown analysis and graphs of these indicators for the primary decision-maker are
provided in the following subsections.
5.2.3.1    Age of Primary Decision-Maker
The average age of the primary decision-maker in the whole sample is 45 years. In dual adult households
the age of the main male decision maker is 44 years as compared to the average age of the main female
decision maker at 32 years. In female adult only households the average age of the primary decision-maker
is 50 years and in male adult only households the average age of the primary decision-maker is 55years.
The average age of the primary decision-maker is balanced across the EV, VV and ML vulnerability
categories.
5.2.3.2    Marital Status of Primary Decision-Maker
The majority (84%) of primary decision-makers report they are married. The incidence of polygamy
amongst the entire sample is 23% and widows make up 12%. In extremely vulnerable (EV) households, the
likelihood of the primary decision-maker being widowed is 16% which is significantly higher than VV and
ML households, both at approximately 4%. This difference should be expected since the widowed result is
likely endogenous to the EV measure since female-headed household status is one indicator that was
collected in the poverty index (PPI) that was used to rank the vulnerability category of households.

5.2.3.3     Education of the Primary Decision-Maker
Only 12% of households reported that the primary decision-maker had received any form of schooling in
the formal education system. There was a larger percentage of primary decision-makers (26%) who reported
attending school but named Quranic or Integrated Quranic as their highest level of schooling.
Disaggregating by sex shows us that just 27% of the adult females in the sample ever attended any school
compared to 43% of the adult males.

5.2.4 Religion
The majority (84%) of the households in the full sample are Muslim. All of the households in Birnin Kebbi
LGA are Muslim but in Danko Wasagu LGA, 30% of the households are from other religions (i.e.
Christianity and Traditional). We found a small fraction of households (42 households) that reported more
than one religion among household members.

5.3 Randomization Balance Checks
Balance tests were conducted to indicate whether the randomization produced balance on various
characteristics from the baseline data across the different experimental conditions. Tables B1-B10 in
Appendix B present the results of weighted t-tests to test whether the different treatment arms and their
corresponding comparison groups are balanced at baseline. The balance checks are conducted on sixteen
key outcome indicators to examine whether the randomization processes succeeded in generating similar
treatment and comparison groups. For each balance test, sampling weights were employed to correct for
differential sampling probabilities across the EV, VV and ML vulnerability categories, where appropriate.
The checks estimate the statistical differences between the treatment and control groups before the program
implementation is rolled out. A joint test of signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates
overall balance for each of the experiments outlined in Figure 2; accordingly, any differences found after
the treatment can be attributed to the program. A discussion and tables for each balance check for each
experiment is presented in Appendix B.


5.4 Labor
5.4.1 Income-Generating Activities
The labor module records the time use for selected activities of all household members aged 15 years or
above, with emphasis on income-generating activities. We find 62% of the household sample (2,455
households) reported at least one member of their household was available for work over the past 30 days,
where the definition of work is restricted to income-generating activities (cash and/or in-kind). The
“availability for work” questioning was part of a series of screener questions that follow the LSMS guide
that gauges whether the respondent was willing and ready to work over the past 30 days. The screener
questions seek to understand whether the individual is currently working, searching for work or not part of

the labor force. We find that 38% of the sample (i.e. those individuals aged 15 years and above13) reported
they were available for work in the past 30 days. The following analysis, therefore, analyzes the income-
generating activities among those 3,547 individuals (76% males and 24% females) who reported
availability for work in the past 30 days.
Among the dual adult households, 56% of the males reported “yes” to being available to work in the past
30 days and only 19% of females reported “yes”. Among the female adult-only households, we find 22%
of the females report being available for work in the past 30 days. Overwhelmingly, females report being
“too busy with household duties and taking care of children” as reasons for not working at income-
generating activities. In follow-up surveys, we will attempt to unpack this result to understand better
whether women are engaging in unpaid labor activities so therefore are not recording it as labor, or whether
the season of the survey contributed to the low levels of participation in income-generating activities.
Among those who reported engaging in income-generating activities, most worked in the agriculture sector,
with 80% of individuals conducting farming activities on a household farm.
Agriculture is the main source of income for household: 86% of 2,455 households work in crop and animal
production. Only 11% of households reported a household member who worked in a non-farm enterprise
over the past 30 days.

5.4.2 How Large a Factor is Unemployment or Underemployment?
Thirty-eight percent of dual adult households reported that no household members worked at an income-
generating activity in the 30 days before the survey. Sixty-five percent of female adult-only households
reported no income-generating activity over the past 30 days, as did 63% of the male adult-only households.
These households were not eligible to respond to the section of the questionnaire that asked about labor.

 Note: Percentages are calculated from 5,046 individuals (aged 15 and above) who did not look for income-generating activities
 in the past 30 days. “Waiting” includes waiting for the agricultural season, waiting to be called back to employment, or on
 leave. “Others” includes traveling, religious prohibition, illiteracy etc.

Only 10% of households gave “waiting for the agricultural season” or “waiting to be recalled to work by
an employer” as reasons for not looking for an income-generating activity in the past 30 days. Dependents
within the households (i.e., those who are too young, old or sick to work) and those who are still in school
make up about 30% of the response. The majority of females in both dual adult households and female
adult only households reported housework or childcare duties as the main reason they did not look for
income-generating activities in the past 30 days.

5.4.3 Female Unpaid Labor in Agriculture
In the Women’s Survey section of the household questionnaire, we ask the main female in the household
whether they have participated in food crop farming, cash crop farming, or livestock raising within the past
12 months. Of the 3,860 women who reported information in this section, we find that 36% of women
reported participating in any one of these activities in the last year. The discrepancy of this 36% result and
the 20% that reported working in the past 30 days in the labor section could potentially be explained by the
construction of the labor question, the differing timeframe of the question, the particular season that the
baseline survey was conducted in, or, if the labor was unpaid, it may not have been recorded in the labor
section. Follow-up surveys will pay particular attention to collecting detailed information on income-
generating activities outside the home, as well as on home-based productive work and reproductive
activities.

5.4.4 Time Spent on Other Activities in the Household
Households within the sample spend a significant amount of time collecting firewood and fetching water
in a day. These activities seem to be gendered, with men spending, on average, 82 minutes during the day
prior to the interview collecting firewood, versus women, who spent 47 minutes. The gender difference in
fetching water is mostly driven by women in Danko Wasagu LGA, who spent on average 64 minutes
fetching water, compared to women in Birnin Kebbi, who spend 39 minutes. The time spent on these other
activities does not differ when we disaggregate by vulnerability category.

5.4.5 Constraints to Business Operations
Eleven percent of the households in the sample reported a household member who worked in a non-farm
enterprise over the past 30 days. The main non-farm business activities that respondents are involved in
include retail, food services, tailoring, animal feed production and taxi driving. When those individuals
were asked what the top three constraints to their business operations were, the majority named “financial”
constraints within their top three constraints.

5.5 Access to Finance
Just 1% of adults reported owning a bank account. Seven percent of the adult sample reported saving with
some other informal savings group.
Borrowing outcomes are equally very low with just 1.5% of the adult sample (139 individuals) having
borrowed from any source over the last 12 months. Those individuals who were successful in borrowing
funds typically borrow from friends and relatives. The primary reason for obtaining a loan was for
household consumption (52% among those who obtained a loan).

 Note: Percentages are calculated from the 139 adults who borrowed in the past 12 months.

As for the ability to lend to others, only 3.5% of the adult sample reported lending to friends or family over
the last 12 months. Follow-up surveys will attempt to understand further the demand and supply-side
constraints being faced by households in this region in terms of access to loans and saving options available.

5.6 Agriculture
5.6.1 Ownership of Agricultural Land
The agriculture section of the survey asks whether any household member had cultivated any agricultural
land and/or owns any agricultural land that was not cultivated since the beginning of the agricultural season.
We find 55% of households within the full sample reported owning at least one plot of land. The graphic
below suggests the number of plots owned by the household does not differ much across the vulnerability
categories – EV, VV, and ML.

 Note: Percentages are calculated from the 2772 EV, 958 VV and 246 ML households in the sample

5.6.2 Size of Agricultural Land Holding
A more accurate measure of agricultural land ownership, rather than the number of plots owned, is the size
of agricultural land holding, which is estimated by converting the farmer’s self-reported size of each plot
to common size units (hectares) and summing across all plots owned by that household. Land ownership
seemingly differs considerably across the two LGAs. The high average land size in Birnin Kebbi is driven
up by a few households who have substantial land holdings; however, on average, the households in Birnin
Kebbi own three times as much land as households in Danko Wasagu.
                               Table 13: Average Agricultural Land Sizes by LGA
          Indicator Agricultural Land Size                          Birnin Kebbi             Danko Wasagu
          Average Number Plots (all households)                           0.8                      0.6
          Average Number Plots (conditional on at least one plot)         1.3                      1.1
          Average Land Size (all households)                         3.0 Hectares             0.8 Hectares
          Average Land Size (households with at least one plot)      4.9 Hectares             1.6 Hectares
Using the self-reported measure of land size, we find that 19% of the households own more than one hectare
of land. In the PPI survey, the percentage of households who reported owning more than one hectare of
land was 36%. This discrepancy could be attributed to measurement error since it may be difficult to
estimate the size of your agricultural land. There may also have been a misunderstanding of what a hectare
might be in the PPI survey since initially the size of a “football field” was used to conceptualize one hectare
of land which could have captured a subjective understanding. After one week of PPI data collection the
interviewers were instructed to conceptualize one hectare by estimating using the ridges on farm land that
are typical in the region which was also followed in the baseline survey. Land size in general is a difficult

thing to measure accurately and many recent examinations of land measurement say that using farmer
estimates of land size usually lead to errors.14. The agricultural questions in the baseline survey were asked
to the manager of the plot (typically found to be the male decision maker in the household) whereas the PPI
was typically posed to the female decision maker which could have implications on the accuracy of the
estimate. The discrepancy between the two estimates of average landholdings is programmatically
important since land ownership greater than one hectare is typically used as ineligibility criteria for the
Feed the Future program and therefore could be excluding households who would otherwise be deemed
vulnerable.

5.6.3 Types of Responsibility for Agricultural Land
Three different measures of responsibility for agricultural plots were collected in the survey that asked the
primary manager of the plot:
      1) Measure 1: Who in the household does this plot belong to (ownership)?
      2) Measure 2: Who in the household primarily cultivates this plot?
      3) Measure 3: Who in the household makes the most decisions on this plot?
When defining responsibility based on Measure 1, we find that 95% of households solely name the
household head as the primary owner of the plot. Using Measure 2, we find that 90% of the households
name the household head as the primary cultivator of the plot. Using Measure 3, we find that 95% of the
households name the household head as the primary decision maker for the plot. This shows that when it
comes to formal ownership and making decisions with regards to agricultural land, typically, the household
head will be responsible. Other household members may help to cultivate the land but are rarely considered
owners or decision-makers.

5.6.4 Common Crops
Beans (cowpea), millet (maiwa) and rice were more commonly grown in Birnin Kebbi, whereas guinea
corn/sorghum, groundnut/peanut and maize were more commonly grown in Danko Wasagu.

5.6.5 Extension Services
Only 12% of households in the sample report access to any kind of agricultural extension service. Five
percent of households reported they received information on fertilizer use and 2% of households received
information on pest control and irrigation services. The source of the information was primarily through
lead farmers or peer farmers (neighbor or relative), with 59% of the households who received any
information citing these two as the source of information.

5.6.6 Agricultural By-products
We asked about secondary products from the farm and animals that may be used to generate income for the
households; 93% of households reported that they earned no income from agricultural by-products they
produced. Among the remaining 7% of households, the most common by-product items that were reported
included bean stem and leaves (harawa), cow dung, eggs and guinea corn stem (dry).


5.7 Consumption
Consumption data was collected in the baseline survey using a questionnaire that asked about both food
and non-food consumption and expenditures over three recall periods - in the past 7 days, past 30 days, and
past 6 months. In the food section, 34 of the most common food items in the region were listed and
households were asked questions about consumption of each item in the past 7 days. The consumption and
expenditure information will be important in assessing program impact because it is hypothesized that
vulnerable households in the program may change their diets or consume larger quantities or better quality
food items as a result of the program. Similarly, for non-food consumption, a variety of common household
items were listed; we would expect households to purchase more “luxury” items or assets once their basic
nutrition needs are met as a result of the program.

5.7.1 Most Important Goods in the Consumption Basket
The top five food and drink items consumed by the households were guinea corn/sorghum, millet, maize,
rice and water, as measured by the number of times the food items were mentioned to have been consumed
in the past 7 days. This matches with the top crops that are cultivated by the households in the sample,
suggesting that many households conduct subsistence farming. We find 6.4% of the households who did
not consume any of the 34 food items listed in the survey in the past 7 days. It is difficult to tell if this non-

response is due to food insecurity or how the question was being asked and therefore follow-up
questionnaires will be developed to try to better capture consumption patterns.
In terms of non-food items, the most commonly mentioned items were palm kernel oil used as a cooking
fuel, electricity, firewood, matches, household care items and recharge cards. In the longer recall non-food
item purchases in the last 6 months, the most commonly mentioned were purchases of clothes and shoes.


5.8 Asset Ownership
One percent of households reported owning no household assets. The most commonly owned items were
mats, beds, mattresses and radios. Just one household in the sample owned a car and 21 households owned
a motorbike. Eighty-two percent of households reported owning at least one agricultural asset. The most
commonly owned agricultural items include hoes, cutlasses, and sickles.


5.9 Animal Ownership
In Kebbi State, livestock is an important aspect of wealth and income generation for the households. We
find 25% of households own at least one animal; this percentage of ownership was similar across the
vulnerability categories. The most commonly owned animals include goats, cows, chickens and sheep. In
terms of ownership we find there are 88% of households in Danko Wasagu LGA who do not own any
animals compared to 67% in Birnin Kebbi LGA. Since field reports indicate that grazing land in Danko
Wasagu is of better quality than in Birnin Kebbi, follow-up work will attempt to estimate the value of
livestock held in both these locations.

5.10 Women’s Empowerment and the Adapted WEAI
In the FNLP baseline survey questionnaire, we included a number of decision-making questions to be able
to create an empowerment index that draws from the components of the Women’s Empowerment in
Agriculture Index (WEAI). This adaptation of the WEAI aims to measure empowerment using the WEAI
as a starting point but cannot be directly compared to WEAI collected in other countries. We will use the
empowerment index to make comparisons over time from baseline survey to follow-up surveys.

5.10.1 Indicators included in the impact evaluation baseline survey
The original WEAI includes five domains of empowerment: Production, Resources, Income, Leadership,
and Time. However, this adaptation of the WEAI excluded the Leadership domain. The questions included
in the baseline survey are sufficient to cover the four remaining domains. All the indicators within the four
domains were not included in the survey since they were either not applicable to the sample or too difficult
to collect during the baseline particularly since we were conscious of the length of the survey. The indicators
collected and their associated weights that were applied to create an empowerment score are listed below:
                      Table 15: WEAI Indicators in the Impact Evaluation Baseline Survey
                                          WEAI Indicator                 Weight
                             1   Input in productive decisions              1/4
                             2   Asset ownership                           1/12
                             3   Rights over assets                        1/12
                             4   Access to and decisions over credit       1/12
                             5   Control over use of income                 1/4
                             6   Workload                                   1/4



These six indicators have been weighted so that they sum to 100%. Note that the sample of women used to
calculate the asset ownership indicator (i.e. the denominator when calculating the percentages) differs from
the other indicators in the empowerment index since the data was collected from the asset section and the
other indicators come from data in the women’s survey section. In the data 2,615 women reported
ownership of any asset type and 3,860 women answered the women’s survey section.
Data on the remaining 4 indicators in the WEAI (satisfaction with leisure time, autonomy in production,
group membership and speaking up in public) were not collected in the Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods
impact evaluation baseline survey. Administering the full WEAI questionnaire was not possible due to
survey length, so proxies for the indicators were established from elsewhere in the data whenever possible.
Since the objective of the baseline data collection was to be able to track measures of empowerment over
time we had to forgo the opportunity to collect the full WEAI that should administer questions to the same
respondent in the same section. A drawback to the approach used in this report is that the resulting score
from the empowerment index cannot be directly compared to the WEAI created in other countries.

5.10.2 Adapted WEAI Sample Size
The questionnaire that collected most of the components of the adapted WEAI was administered to the
main female decision maker in the household across the full sample of households – we have data on the 6
indicators for 3,860 households and this is the sample that is included in the empowerment index. In our
analysis we include all women who responded to the WEAI questions and not just women in households
that reported engaging in agricultural activity since our sample is administered in rural areas. We assume
that rural livelihoods are often linked to the agricultural sector in both direct and indirect ways and so
include the full sample of women. We also include a shortened analysis for the sample restricted to just
women who had indicated engagement in agriculture activity at the time of the survey.
We calculated an adapted WEAI score that was created by taking the weighted average of the 6 indicators
that represent 4 out of 5 domains for the sample of women. The average score for the sample is 0.38. The
adapted WEAI score presented here is not directly comparable to the WEAI calculated for other countries
since some of the composites were not included in the survey. The adapted WEAI, although not comparable
to other adaptations of the WEAI, will be compared to follow-up data collected after the FNLP
implementation is completed. The individual components are presented below and can be interpreted
individually.

5.10.3 Indicator 1: Input in Productive Decisions
In Kebbi State, we found a large proportion of women who did not engage in any of the activities outlined
in indicator 1 of the WEAI. In the labor section, only 20% of female decision makers answered “yes” to
being available for work in the past 30 days, with women citing being “too busy with household duties and
taking care of children” as reasons for being unavailable to work in income-generating activities. We could
potentially be underestimating the involvement of women in these income-generating activities if the season
when the baseline survey was conducted was during a quiet time in the agricultural season. However, this
result was somewhat consistent with the result obtained from the questions analyzing a women’s adequacy
into input in productive decisions where we find that only 36% of females participated (and had at least
some input into the decision making) in at least one of the productive decisions that make up the indicator
over the last year.

Among the seven activities, questions about the first four activities (food crop farming, cash crop farming,
livestock raising and fishing) were all administered in the women’s questionnaire and followed the same
structure as the WEAI questionnaire. Questions about the other three activities – taking the crop to market,
being involved in keeping an animal, and being involved in making plot decisions – were administered
within the agricultural part of the baseline questionnaire; if the female was mentioned as a decision-maker
for any plot or animal owned by the household, then she would be deemed adequate in that particular
activity. The data was collected in this manner because administering the full WEAI questionnaire was not
possible due to survey length, so proxies for the indicators were established from elsewhere in the data
whenever possible. Figure 16 shows that most of the women had some input in food crop farming, with
22% saying they had some input into the decisions surrounding that activity. Conversely, there were just
2% of women who ever participated in taking a crop to market. We define achievement of adequacy for
this indicator to be if 1) the woman participated in at least two productive activities and 2) had some input
into the decision making. Within our sample of 3,860 women, we find that 21% of women achieved
adequacy in the Production domain based on this adequacy cutoff.

5.10.4 Indicator 2: Asset Ownership
If a woman is mentioned as a sole owner or joint owner of a particular asset in a list of household items,
agricultural items and animals, then she is deemed adequate for the asset ownership indicator. We find 68%
of the women sample (2,615 women) report sole or joint ownership of any type of asset (either household
assets, agricultural assets, animals or any combination of all three). The majority of female asset ownership
is concentrated within household assets, where 71% of women who owned an asset reported only owning
household assets and 3% of the women who owned assets were named as owners of all three types.

 Note: Percentages are calculated from the 2,615 women who reported ownership of any asset type

5.10.5 Indicator 3: Rights over Assets
If the woman reports that she can decide whether to sell, give away, mortgage, rent or purchase a new item
for any of the household and agriculture asset items presented in the questionnaire, she is deemed adequate
for this indicator. We find that 35% of women reported that they had purchase or sale rights over an asset.
This result means that 53% of the women who reported that they owned an asset didn’t necessarily have
any rights over that asset.

5.10.6 Indicator 4: Access to and Decisions over Credit
Since just 3% of households within the sample borrowed from any source over the last 12 months, we
would expect adequacy for this indicator to be very low. Only 7 women (0.2% of the sample) reported
being involved in any decisions to borrow.

5.10.7 Indicator 5: Control over Use of Income
We find 22% of women achieved adequacy for control over the use of household income, whereby they
had some input in at least one of the decisions on spending other than making minor household
expenditures. The breakdown of activities into its four components suggests that the primary driver for
adequacy is involvement in making household expenditures. Since farming work is the primary activity of
households in the study sample, we find overall low activity in non-farm and wage work. Of the 11% of
women in the sample who said they participated in non-farm income-generating activities, 72% had at least
some input into decisions about the resulting income. Of the 6% of women in the sample who participated
in wage and salary employment, 63% had at least some input into decisions regarding their earnings.

 Note: Percentages are calculated from the 3,860 women who had full data on the indicator

5.10.8 Indicator 6: Workload
The standard approach to collecting time use data that is employed in the WEAI questionnaire collects
information about activities over a 24hour period. Since it was time-consuming to collect full time-use
information, only nine activities from the WEAI were selected to be included in the survey that represent
the activities that the research team considered productive work activities appropriate for the female
respondent. The workload indicator requires that a woman works, on average, less than 10.5 hours per day
in the last week to achieve adequacy. Based on this list of nine activities that we deemed appropriate for
the study sample, we find that 75% of women achieve adequacy for the workload indicator. The average
total time spent daily for all activities for the women who achieved adequacy was 3.4 hours and for those
women who did not achieve adequacy the average was 15.9 hours. The components of the workload
indicator is presented in Figure 19.

 Note: Daily hours spent on each activity were calculated by dividing the time spent last week by seven

An analysis of each activity shows that women who did not achieve adequacy in this domain time spent a
disproportionate amount of time cooking, doing domestic work or caring for children and the elderly:
women who did not achieve adequacy spent almost 5 times longer on these three activities than women
who were defined to be adequate. Because levels of working “too much” are driven by household-based
production, yet many women in our sample did not report any labor force participation, further analysis is
needed in follow-up work to determine an appropriate cutoff.

5.10.9 Which Indicators Contribute the Most to Women’s Disempowerment?
In summary, the percentage of women who have inadequate achievements by indicator are presented in
Figure 20 below.

The breakdown of individual indicators is helpful to assess the areas that might be contributing
disproportionately to women’s disempowerment amongst the sample. Figure 20 shows the indicators where
over 50% of the women in the sample obtained inadequate achievements: Input in productive decisions;
purchase, sale or transfer of assets; access to and decisions on credit; and control over the use of income.
Improvements in any of these indicators resulting from the Feed the Future programming could potentially
have a marked effect on our measure of women’s empowerment in the study LGAs.

5.10.10           Defining Empowerment
The original WEAI defines a person as empowered if that individual has achieved adequacy in 80% or
more of the weighted indicators. However, because the FNLP baseline survey collected data on only 6 of
the 10 indicators across just 4 of the 5 domains that are included in the original WEAI, it is not possible to
calculate the WEAI according to the original methodology.
In order to establish how to best define empowerment, we first conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify
an appropriate threshold to distinguish empowerment from disempowerment.
                 Table 17: WEAI Indicators and Adequacy in the Impact Evaluation Baseline Survey

 Note: Percentages are calculated from the 3,860 women who had full data on the indicators

If we were to define empowerment as achievement of adequacy in 3 out of 4 domains then 15% of the
sample of women would be defined as empowered.

   6 indicators     0.3%

 Note: Percentages are calculated from the 3,860 women who had full data on the indicators

Similarly, if we were to define empowerment to require adequacy in at least 4 out of 6 indicators then 14.6%
of the sample of women would be defined as empowered.
The sensitivity analysis suggests that the chosen threshold can have big implications on the reported
empowerment levels of the study sample. The level of women’s empowerment in the study sample defined
by the two chosen definitions above is 15%. Any empowerment impacts from the Feed the Future program
will be analyzed across different definitions of empowerment.

5.10.11            Women Engaged in Crop Cultivation and Livestock Raising
The following analysis restricts the study sample to the 36% of women (1,360 women) in the sample who
said they were involved in either food crop farming, cash crop farming or livestock raising over the past 12
months.

 Note: Percentages are calculated from the 1,360 women who were engaged in agriculture over the last year

As one would expect, those women who are actually involved in farming practices have better decision-
making outcomes for the input in productive decisions indicator: 56% of women who are involved in
agriculture had adequate achievements in this indicator versus just 21% of the whole sample of women.
We cannot be sure on the direction of causality - women may be more empowered because they work in
agriculture, or they may work in agriculture, outside the house, because they are empowered. Control over
the use of income was slightly better for women in farming but 60% still had inadequate achievements in
the indicator. Lack of access to credit and rights over assets still contribute considerably to disempowerment
for women in agriculture.

5.10.12            Decision-Making Indicators
In the baseline survey, we included a number of decision-making questions. For each question, we assess
the percentage of women who stated that they have inadequate achievements in the particular decision out
of a total of 14 decisions. Inadequacy could be associated with the household not being involved in the
particular activity or the woman not having any input into the decision. Follow-up data collection will look
to identify the areas where the women’s input into decisions might change as a result of the program.

analyzed when looking at dynamics over time.

5.11 Poverty Profile
The following analysis looks at the poverty status of the sample at the time of the baseline survey. The
poverty profile and empowerment assessment were conducted to assign a pre-program level for the sample
in the study for which we will measure a treatment impact.

5.11.1 Poverty Line

The two international poverty lines presented in the analysis are the USD 1.25/day and the USD 1.90/day
lines. The World Bank updated the international poverty line in October 2015 to USD 1.90/day from USD
1.25/day to reflect changes in the cost of living. In the following analysis, we present tables for the USD
1.90/day poverty line but also present the equivalent USD 1.25/day level. The USD 1.25/day poverty line
identifies 85% of households as “very poor” and the USD 1.90/day poverty line identifies 92% of
households as “very poor”. The decision rule in classifying a household as “very poor” (and the “not-
very-poor”) is whether per capita daily expenditures of a household fall below (or above) the poverty line.
                     Table 19: International Poverty Lines and the Nigerian Naira Equivalents
              Poverty lines per person per day                              Value (NGN)
                        USD 1.25/day                                           107.4
                        USD 1.90/day                                           163.3
          Note: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) for Nigeria fixed in October 2015 NGN 85.9 per USD 1.


5.11.2 Measuring Daily Income and Expenditures

Throughout the analysis, we adopt three measures of income/expenditures:
        Daily wage per capita: calculated from the Labor section, we sum all the wage information of all
         household members and divide by the total number of household members.15
        Daily income per capita: calculated from Aspirations section, we obtain the reported present annual
         income of the household and divide this by the total number of household members.16
        Daily expenditures per capita: calculated from Food and Non-Food Expenditure sections, we sum
         all the expenditures and divide by the total number of household members.17




15
  The labor section was included in the household survey and asked all household members above the age of 15
years information about their participation in employment over the past 30 days. The daily wage measure is
constructed by adding up all the daily wages of the “last payment” that was received by each household member.
Only 30% of households reported a non-zero daily wage. Variables were winsorized at 0.25%.
16
  The aspirations section was included in the household survey and asked the respondents about their aspirations for
future income and includes a question on present annual income. Within this section of the questionnaire, the present
annual income of the household is recorded and then divided by the estimated number of working days in the year
(240) to get an approximate daily level.

   The food and non-food expenditure sections were included in the household survey and ask expenditure questions
covering the past 7 days, the past 30 days, and the past 6 months. Total expenditures of the household sum across all
items. Variables were winsorized at 0.25% of the cumulative distribution.

The daily expenditure per capita measure is cited throughout this document as the preferred measure of
poverty. We also discuss the limitations of each measure in section 5.11.4 below.

5.11.3 Average Income and Expenditure for the Baseline Sample

The PPP adjusted average expenditure per capita is just USD 0.74/day, which falls below both the USD
1.25/day and USD 1.90/day poverty lines. The sample consists of households that can be considered very
poor in Nigeria, by international standards.

The values presented in Table 20 shows that the average daily wage per capita for the whole sample is USD
0.86/day which is about twice the average of the daily income per capita of USD 0.41/day measure of
poverty, while the average of the daily expenditures per capita is USD 0.74/day.
The average PPI score of the total sample of households is 46.78 points with a standard deviation of 7.67.
Within the sample, the household with the lowest possible score has 24 points (least vulnerable) while the
household with the highest score has 80 points (most vulnerable).
Table 21 below displays the different poverty measures by vulnerability category. The values presented in
Panel A are simply an average of the sample from the baseline survey for EV, VV and ML and have not
been reweighted to adjust for the original sampling design. Since the EV, VV and ML categories were
originally classified within each ward then there could potentially have been some households with a certain
PPI score that were classified as VV in one ward but ML in a different ward. Therefore, we would expect
to see some overlap in the outcomes across the three vulnerability categories when analyzing the entire
sample and this could potentially help to explain why it is difficult to identify significant differences in the
figures of Panel A between the three categories.
Panel B in Table 21 presents the standardized values of the poverty measures which gives us a clearer view
of the dispersion of the data within the groups. Intuitively, the means for the EV category do not vary as
much as the means for the VV and ML categories. The dispersion of the data for the households within the
category ML varies more than for those in the EV category, especially for the outcomes of income and
expenditures.
Finally, in the last row of Table 21, we present the scores from the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI) for
the three vulnerability categories. The PPI score is a tool used to determine the likelihood that a particular
household is living below the poverty line. The PPI is comprised of a number of indicators of vulnerability
and while it is expected to be correlated with the poverty measures, they should not be expected to be exact
substitutes. The average PPI score for EV category is 51 points with a higher variation (4.61 SD) than the
VV and ML categories (the higher the PPI score, the more vulnerable the household).

The measure of daily per capita expenditures, in USD (PPP) terms, shows the least variation across the full
sample of vulnerable households. The kernel density plots in Figure 25 (axis not drawn to scale) show that
there is an aggregation of daily expenditures per capita around zero and any variation in the measure is
mainly found along the tail of the distribution. Therefore, these indicators of income or consumption at one
point in time are not sufficient as a standalone to determine the potential variation in poverty across the
sample.

5.11.4 Consumption as the Preferred Measure of Poverty

Despite the limitations discussed above about using income and consumption to measure poverty, we trust
consumption as the better indicator for poverty measurement than income. For the income measures of
poverty, the daily wage per capita measure is USD 0.86 versus USD 0.41 for the daily income per capita

measure. This large discrepancy suggests that income measures are prone to seasonality, recall and
definition issues.
The daily wage measure is constructed by adding up all the daily wages of the “last payment” that was
received by each household member. Around 30% of the households (1183 observations) reported a non-
zero daily wage, which suggests that these households are unlikely to be representative of the total sample
of households where wage employment is limited. From the sample of households that reported a non-zero
daily wage; 67% belong to the EV category, 28% belong to the VV category and 5% of the households are
part of the ML category. The daily wage households differ significantly with the households that do not
report a daily wage because, on average:
            The primary decision-maker is younger
            There is a lower proportion of married households
            There is a lower proportion of households with female as the primary decision-maker
            There is a greater percentage of polygamous households
            There is a greater percentage of households where the primary decision-maker attended school
             and knows how to read and write.
            There is a greater number of household members
            There is a greater number of agriculture plots owned by household
            There is a greater proportion of households that faced the situation where there was not enough
             food to feed the household in the past 12 months
The daily income measure is likely to suffer from lump-sum recall issues since this measure is calculated
from a question that asks the respondent for the present annual income of the household. Measures of
income over longer periods, such as a year, are likely to face recall bias issues.
The daily expenditure per capita measure is USD 0.74 (PPP). Consumption expenditures are likely to be
better measured than income: because the sample is largely made up of farming households, income flows
are likely to fluctuate during the year due to the seasonality of farming practices. The questionnaire poses
questions about both food and non-food expenditures in the past 7 days, past 30 days, and past 6 months
and we believe this gives the respondent an anchor to think about all expenditures, however small, and
allows for a better measure of the wellbeing of the household. Although the consumption measure is going
to be seasonal (for example, to the extent that there are fasting periods, or that some products are/not
available for consumption, etc.) there is likely to be more smoothing than with income or wages. Both
measures are likely to suffer if there are shares of income or consumption that are not be easily monetized
due to households consuming their own production or exchanging it for some other goods. However,
relative to income we believe consumption expenditures provide a better picture of actual standards of
living than current income, especially when income fluctuates considerably. We refer to the daily
expenditure per capita measure throughout the following analysis. One thing to note is that the measure of
income and consumption levels is reflective only of the period of seasonality in which the baseline data
was collected and is not necessarily representative of the entire year. It will therefore be important to collect
endline information in the same season as the baseline survey.

5.11.5 Number of Poor Households: The Household Count

For the household count ratio, we count the number of households that are below the poverty line. The
calculation for the USD 1.90/day poverty line is equivalent to per capita expenditures being less than NGN
163.25/day based on the PPP-adjusted exchange rate. At these values, the USD 1.90/day poverty line based
on daily expenditures per capita identifies 92% of households as “very poor”. These households are indeed
among the most vulnerable in the region as targeted by the program.

Table 23 presents the number of households below the USD 1.90/day poverty line across the three
vulnerability categories; we find no notable differences in the household count ratio for EV, VV and ML.

                   Note: Poverty is defined as USD 1.90/day

The poverty statistics within the study sample are slightly worse than those reported by the National Bureau
of Statistics (NBS) who reported that Sokoto State's poverty rate was at 86.4% in 2010 based on the USD
1.25/day poverty line.18 Estimates for the poverty rate in Kebbi State are not available from the NBS,
however, since Sokoto State is neighboring Kebbi we provide this NBS estimate on the assumption that
they have comparable poverty rates.

5.11.6 Size of the Poverty Gap: The Poverty Gap Index

The poverty gap is the mean shortfall from the poverty line (where we count the non-poor as having zero
shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as
well as its incidence. The poverty gap index estimates the depth of poverty by considering how far, on
average, the poor are from that poverty line. We find, on average, the poor have an expenditure shortfall
of 74% of the USD 1.90/day poverty line. We also find, on average, the poor have an expenditure
shortfall of 66% of the USD 1.25/day poverty line.

5.11.7 Poverty differences across the LGAs

We find a difference in the depth of poverty measurement across the two LGAs. On average, the poor
have an expenditure shortfall of 65% of the USD 1.90/day poverty line in Birnin Kebbi versus 81% in
Danko Wasagu. The poverty differences between the LGAs could be attributed to Danko Wasagu being
less well-connected than Birnin Kebbi, which has better access to Sokoto State.

5.11.8 Poverty differences across Gendered Household Type

As one would expect, the poor in female adult-only households have a greater expenditure shortfall from
the USD 1.90/day poverty line at 82%, versus 72% for dual adult (male and female) households. For the
USD 1.25/day poverty line, the poor in female adult-only households have an expenditure shortfall of
75% versus 64% for dual adult households.

5.11.9 Income Shocks faced by Vulnerable Households

Since the sample consists largely of farming households, their incomes are expected to vary a great deal
over the year. The theory that receiving cash transfers at different points in the farming season could have
different implications for expenditure decisions relies on the assumption that households are more cash and
credit constrained at particular times of the year. The baseline survey was completed at one specific time
during the farming season and we expect shorter consumption surveys to help us better track variability in
income. Along these lines, 26% of households in the sample reported experiencing an income shock in the
past 24 months, where income shock was simply defined as whether any of the events happened (see Figure
26). Although more than a quarter of households experienced economic shocks, just 1% of households (32
households) reported receiving money or in-kind benefits from any safety net program over the last year.

5.11.10             Food Security
Poverty is conventionally measured by the income or expenditure level that can sustain a bare minimum
standard of living. However, other dimensions such as health, nutrition, life expectancy, access to clean
water, and food security are also central to welfare. Consumption-based measures are therefore
complemented with measures of food security to produce a more dimensional understanding of household

Nineteen percent of households reported that in the past 12 months, they have faced a situation where there
was not enough food to feed the household. The reasons for food insecurity are expressed in terms of having
inadequate household farm-derived food stocks, with 64% of the food insecure households suggesting that
lack of food security was due to small landholdings or poor farming conditions (lack of rain, lack of other
inputs, or post-harvest crop loss).

6 Summary
The Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project impact evaluation seeks to measure the impact of the
agricultural-led program on the livelihoods of vulnerable households. This baseline survey established
baseline indicators for background characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes, and confirmed that
the sample is made up of rural, farming households with 80% of the working population engaged in crop
and animal production as their primary income activity. The finding that treatment and comparison groups
are balanced along observable characteristics at baseline adds credibility to the randomization process so
any differences emerging after the program can be attributed to the treatment. Commensurate with program
targeting criteria, the majority of households in the study sample fall below the USD 1.90/day poverty line
with 92% of households defined as “very poor” based on a measure of daily expenditures per capita. On
average, the poor in the sample have an expenditure shortfall of 74% of the USD 1.90/day poverty line.
The average household has five people, three of whom are children. Nineteen percent of households said
they faced food insecurity within the past 12 months with households suggesting they were unable to
generate enough food stocks from the land. Labor force participation is low, with 37% of the sample
reporting no persons within their household having worked at income-generating activities in the 30 days
prior to the baseline survey; however, this finding could be related to the season in which the survey was
conducted. Schooling outcomes show that just 12% of the adults in the sample attended any formal school
and self-reported literacy rates were at 40%. Fifty-five percent of households owned at least one plot of
agricultural land with self-reported average land size of 3.3 hectares. Access to finance is very low with
just 1% of adults owning a bank account. Based on a measure of the adapted WEAI, only 15% of women
in the sample were deemed empowered; women mainly lack control over the use of income and access to
and decisions on credit.

Appendix B: Balance Tables
Table B1: Comparing Feed the Future Villages with non-Feed the Future Villages
The randomization process, when comparing households in the Feed the Future treatment villages and Feed
the Future control villages (Table B1), produced balanced groups at baseline. Treatment and control villages
are balanced along observable covariates, with two exceptions: treatment households are (at the 10% level
of statistical significance) less likely to be female headed and are more likely to have literate household
heads. The extent to which more literate or dual adult households could take better advantage of program
services could introduce bias into estimates and we can control for this at endline when identifying the
impact of the interventions. A joint test of signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates
overall balance.

Table B2: Comparing Caseworker and No-caseworker Households
Table B2 gives results of the randomization balance check between the caseworker households and the no
caseworker households in the Feed the Future villages. On average, randomization created balance between
caseworker and no caseworker groups on observed characteristics. In a joint test of all variables, we cannot
reject the hypothesis that the baseline characteristics of the caseworker and no caseworker samples are
statistically identical.

Table B3: Monthly vs No Cash Transfer in Feed the Future Villages
Monthly cash transfer and No cash transfer groups in Feed the Future villages are balanced along observable
baseline characteristics, with two exceptions: Monthly cash transfer households are signiﬁcantly more
likely to have literate household heads and have a lower mean level of daily per capita expenditures. A joint
test of signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates overall balance.

Table B4: Quarterly vs No Cash Transfer in Feed the Future Villages
Quarterly cash transfer and No cash transfer groups in Feed the Future villages are balanced along
observable baseline characteristics, with one exception: Quarterly cash transfer households have on average
a larger number of plots than no cash transfer households, significant at the 5% level. A joint test of
signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates overall balance.

Table B5: All (Monthly + Quarterly) vs No Cash Transfer in Feed the Future Villages
All cash transfer households and No cash transfer groups in Feed the Future villages are balanced along
observable baseline characteristics, with three exceptions: All cash transfer households are signiﬁcantly
more likely to have literate household heads, have on average a larger number of plots and are less likely
to have no land ownership than No cash transfer households. The agricultural differences could suggest that
the cash transfer households may have better opportunities to diversify their risk with higher land ownership
either with their own production or with purchases made possible due to increased income from the
program. A joint test of signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates overall balance.

Table B6: Monthly vs No Cash Transfer in Control Villages
Monthly cash transfer and No cash transfer groups in non-Feed the Future villages are balanced along
observable baseline characteristics, with one exception: Monthly cash transfer households are signiﬁcantly

(at the 10% level) less likely to be married. A joint test of signiﬁcance (chi -squared) of mean diﬀerences
demonstrates overall balance.

Table B7: Quarterly vs No Cash Transfer in Control Villages
Quarterly cash transfer and No cash transfer groups in non-Feed the Future villages are balanced along
observable baseline characteristics, with two exceptions: Quarterly cash transfer household heads are
significantly less likely to be married and more likely to be in polygamous relationships. A joint test of
signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates overall balance.

Table B8: All (Monthly + Quarterly) vs No Cash Transfer in Control Villages
All cash transfer households and no cash transfer groups in non-Feed the Future villages are balanced along
observable baseline characteristics, with one exception: All cash transfer households are signiﬁcantly less
likely to be married. A joint test of signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates overall
balance.

Table B9: All Cash Transfer Households in All Villages vs No Cash Transfer Households in
       All Villages
The randomization process, when comparing households receiving cash transfers (monthly and quarterly)
to no cash transfers pooled across both treatment and control villages (Table B9), produced balanced groups
at baseline. All cash transfer households and no cash transfer households are balanced along observable
covariates, with two exceptions: cash transfer households are significantly less likely to be married and less
likely to have no land ownership. A joint test of signiﬁcance (chi-squared) of mean diﬀerences demonstrates
overall balance.

Table B10: All Cash Transfer Households in Feed the Future Villages vs All Cash Transfer
       Households in Control Villages
The randomization process, when comparing cash transfer households in the Feed the Future treatment
villages and control villages (Table B10), did not produce balanced groups at baseline; with four of the
sixteen key variables being significantly different. In addition, in a joint test of all observables, we reject
the hypothesis that the baseline characteristics of the cash transfer households in treatment and control
villages are statistically identical. Although individual poverty measures were balanced, household
agricultural land ownership variables showed significant imbalances where cash transfer households in
treatment villages were more likely to own land greater than one hectare, have a higher number of plots and
are less likely to have no land ownership. The agricultural differences could suggest that the cash transfer
households in treatment villages may have better opportunities to diversify risk either with their own
production on different plots or with purchases made possible due to increased income from the program.
The randomization of the cash transfers in treatment villages and control villages was done separately and
so we should not expect to find balance. However, if we wish to compare these 2 groups it will be important
to control for variables not adequately controlled for by randomization as treatment effects may be biased.
With an endline survey planned in 2018, the quantitative survey aims to support the evaluation of project
impact on outcomes and the research team will control for any observed differences in the estimation
approach.

(1) Columns (1), (2) and (3) report means with standard deviations in parentheses.
(2) Column (4) reports the test of differences of means across columns (2) and (3) for households receiving the monthly cash transfer and
      those receiving no cash transfers in Feed the Future treatment villages. We report OLS regressions which include ward-infrastructure
      stratification fixed effects and standard errors are clustered by village.
(3)   The percent of households with agricultural land greater than 1 hectare is conditional on the household owning land.
(4)   Joint test is the Chi-Sq Statistic, which is computed by jointly estimating a system of seemingly unrelated regressions where the
      explanatory variable is a dummy for treatment with standard errors adjusted for within village correlation and the regressions include
      stratification dummies.

(1) Columns (1), (2) and (3) report means with standard deviations in parentheses.
(2) Column (4) reports the test of differences of means across columns (2) and (3) for households receiving the quarterly cash transfer and
      those receiving no cash transfers in Feed the Future treatment villages. We report OLS regressions which include ward-infrastructure
      stratification fixed effects and standard errors are clustered by village.
(3)   The percent of households with agricultural land greater than 1 hectare is conditional on the household owning land.
(4)   Joint test is the Chi-Sq Statistic, which is computed by jointly estimating a system of seemingly unrelated regressions where the
      explanatory variable is a dummy for treatment with standard errors adjusted for within village correlation and the regressions include
      stratification dummies.

      infrastructure stratification fixed effects and standard errors are clustered by village.
(3)   The percent of households with agricultural land greater than 1 hectare is conditional on the household owning land.
(4)   Joint test is the Chi-Sq Statistic, which is computed by jointly estimating a system of seemingly unrelated regressions where the explanatory
      variable is a dummy for treatment with standard errors adjusted for within village correlation and the regressions include stratification
      dummies.

(1) Columns (1), (2) and (3) report means with standard deviations in parentheses.
(2) Column (4) reports the test of differences of means across columns (2) and (3) for households receiving the quarterly cash transfer and
      those receiving no cash transfers in Feed the Future control villages. We report OLS regressions which include ward-infrastructure
      stratification fixed effects and standard errors are clustered by village.
(3)   The percent of households with agricultural land greater than 1 hectare is conditional on the household owning land.
(4)   Joint test is the Chi-Sq Statistic, which is computed by jointly estimating a system of seemingly unrelated regressions where the
      explanatory variable is a dummy for treatment with standard errors adjusted for within village correlation and the regressions include
      stratification dummies.

Appendix C: Agro-climatic Context
Before the baseline survey, the research team conducted in-field observations in Kebbi in the two LGAs
where the study is taking place and found the two LGAs differ in their farming landscape (see Table 27).
The in-field observations were provided by Tijjani Ahmad, a program manager from Diamond
Development Initiative (DDI). DDI is the civil society organization (CSO) supervising the implementation
of the Feed the Future Nigeria agriculture interventions in Kebbi. The program manager has extensive
experience and knowledge working in the region and understands the farming climate/seasons in Kebbi
State. These observations were only obtained for learning purposes by the research team in preparation for
data collection activities.
