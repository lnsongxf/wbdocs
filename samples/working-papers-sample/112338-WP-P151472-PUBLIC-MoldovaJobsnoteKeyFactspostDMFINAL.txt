                                               Introduction

Moldova has experienced rapid growth and increases in living standards in the past decade.
The economy has grown by an average 5 percent a year in the past 15 years, while the national poverty
rate declined from 26 percent in 2007 to 11 percent in 2014; there are sharp declines observed in the
early 2000s as well.
However, Moldova’s growth model has relied on remittances, with limited job creation. The
World Bank (2016) report Moldova: Paths to Sustained Prosperity finds that Moldova’s growth model
triggered a cycle in which men and women migrated in search of better economic opportunities and
sent remittances home that continued to support consumption-driven growth, and that this
contributed to poverty reduction and welfare improvement among the less well off, particularly those
in rural areas. The wage differential with richer countries in Western Europe and Russia and the lack
of jobs at home were likely push factors for emigration. In fact, employment declined over the past
decade, led by falling labor force participation rates among both men and women. With high internal
demand, combined with weak industrial capacity and high obstacles for firms to invest, expand and
create jobs, remittance inflows led to an increase in imports and widening trade deficits. Under these
circumstances, many Moldovans continued to seek better opportunities abroad. More remittance
inflows were generated, and the cycle repeated itself.
The drivers of growth and poverty reduction are not sustainable. Alongside income from
remittances, pensions have also played an important role in raising incomes among the population,
mainly in urban areas. Increases in wages in the nonagricultural sectors also contributed, but given the
decline in employment the benefits were not broad-based.1 Remittances and pensions may not be able
to sustain progress: the growth in remittance inflows is expected to continue declining, limiting the
role of remittances as a driver of growth and poverty reduction. Meanwhile, the pension system is
unsustainable, and coverage and benefits are expected to decline if reforms are not undertaken. 2
Progress that relies on private and public transfers without job creation does not offer a sustainable
path for improving the living standards of the population, particularly in the context of an aging
society. The demographic pressures the country faces –with a shrinking and aging population– add to
concerns about the prospects of growth and poverty reduction.3
Given the centrality of jobs to Moldova’s past story and future prospects, this Job Diagnostic
contributes to the discussion by drawing from various sources of data to present 10 KEY
FACTS about Moldova’s labor market. These Facts, although not aiming at providing a
comprehensive view of the labor market, can shed light on the demand and supply sides of labor and
the key jobs challenges Moldova faces going forward. This note compiles background analysis
prepared by the Jobs Group for the World Bank and by Dávalos et al. (2016a) report. It relies on
various sources of data. The aggregate macroeconomic analysis uses World Development Indicators
data for sectoral gross domestic product (GDP), employment shares, and labor demographics, and

United Nations data for population projections.4 The microeconomic analysis of household labor
supply relies on Labor Force Surveys from 2006 to 2012, while the analysis of trends in the demand
for labor by firms makes use of the Financial Statements census collected by the National Bureau of
Statistics, a unique panel dataset from 2003 to 2014 that draws on company tax returns.5
The 10 facts presented in the note are as follows:
        Fact 1: Job losses are increasing overall, with productivity-driven economic growth since the
         2000s benefitting a smaller number of people who were able to find jobs
        Fact 2: Workers left agriculture and industry for services, but the 2009 global crisis dampened
         the job prospects in services.
        Fact 3: Out-migration means that Moldova failed to fully capture a demographic dividend for
         the economy, and is now an aging country
        Fact 4: Employment and wage patterns show that job outcomes are becoming less inclusive.
        Fact 5: Despite their rising educational attainments, young people face significant challenges
         finding non-farm jobs
        Fact 6: As inequality in earnings widens, post-secondary education still earns more, but is
         becoming less of a guarantee of a better job
        Fact 7: Efficient firms are raising their productivity by shedding jobs, not creating them, while
         firm entry and survival rates are low.
        Fact 8: The most productive firms (small, young, foreign, and private) firms have the most
         productive jobs, but they are not increasing their share in employment
        Fact 9: While productivity is increasing, a growing share of jobs is in less-productive firms.
        Fact 10: Firms providing employment are typically larger and older, while younger firms are
         struggling, and fewer new firms have been launched since the crisis.
It is key to continue monitoring these trends over time and, after the release of the 2014 census data,
the labor market and demographic challenges that the country faces will need to be revisited to reflect
a more current picture of the situation and the prospects.

     Fact 1: Job losses are increasing overall, with productivity-driven economic
    growth since the 2000s benefitting a smaller number of people who were able
                                      to find jobs

Rapid economic growth was not accompanied by job creation. Since the beginning of the 2000s,
the economy has experienced sustained GDP growth, with the exception of 2008–09, when real GDP
value added fell by 6.3 percent following the global financial crisis.6 Compared with a group of 18
similar, remittance-receiving lower-middle-income countries, the economy’s growth in value added
per capita during 1,370 growth
episodes in 1991–2014 was Box 1: Labor market definitions and Population data:

accompanied by a decline in labor migration of the workforce. That census provides the sampling frame for
                                        both the Household Income and Expenditure surveys and the Labor Force

share of the working-age                         Force/WAP
population in the total population,          Inactivity Rate (I): is equal to (1-LFP)

annually, a cumulative rise of 7.0
percent between 2000 and 2013. However, in response to out-migration and perhaps masking the true
number of short-term outward migrants who do not seek work in Moldova, the labor force
participation rate (the share of the working-age population employed or seeking work) fell
cumulatively by 27 percentage points in 2000–14, to reach 38.1 percent in 2014 (figure 3). These
macrodata are validated by micro labor force surveys showing that the inactivity rate rose from 50
percent to 55 percent in 2007–12.8 Moreover, the share of the working-age population categorized in
labor force surveys as employed dipped from around 47 percent to about 43 percent in 2006–12.
Although data on labor market outcomes and other economic indicators will need to be revised as the
2014 Census data is made available as well as used to improve labor force data collection, the observed
and persistent trends still provide a compelling story of deteriorating labor markets.

tightening monetary policy, and the aftermath of a large-scale bank fraud.

Those who remained in the labor force and were able to find jobs typically found better jobs,
that is, jobs that were more productive9. Among the employed, average value added per worker
rose by 6.4 percent a year, and it increased across nearly every subsector of the economy, although at
the expense of jobs in agriculture and industry (as described under Fact 2 below). Productivity per
employee in agriculture grew annually by 6.4 percent as labor left the sector. Average labor productivity
in the booming service sector rose by 4 percent annually, while productivity in industry fell by 0.2
percent.
Moldova is well above the median in the measure of changes in growth because of changes in
productivity. Compared with 46 countries in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
during 6,992 overlapping growth episodes, the growth of the Moldovan economy in 2000–13 was in
the 86th percentile of per capita GDP growth and the 95th percentile in the contribution of
productivity growth to real GDP growth, but was the poorest performer during almost 7,000 growth
episodes in the contribution of labor force participation growth to overall GDP growth. Across
sectors, the contribution of industrial job creation and productivity growth in Moldova in 2000–13
was in the 9th and 14th percentiles during the relevant 7,000 growth episodes in 46 countries.

  We define “better” jobs as those with higher labor productivity. In Moldova between 90 -92 percent of jobs are in the
informal sector, and relatively generous labor regulations afford comparatively good job security and working conditions.

 Remittances fueled the increases in productivity, which drove growth of the economy. Out-
 migration led to a rise in remittances to 30 percent of GDP, financing a boom in consumption and
 housing and fueling service-driven growth. Though, like many countries in Eastern Europe and

Note: The number for Moldova is the official labor force participation rate. It excludes from the labor force people who are
working abroad or looking for a job abroad. These people are counted as inactive in the official definition.
 Central Asia, Moldova experienced a large drop in real GDP during the global financial crisis, the
 remittance-funded boom in domestic demand and the changing economic structure it induced
 generated greater productivity in 2000–13, and the economy bounced back quickly from the global
 crisis–induced slump. A decomposition of growth in per capita income in 2000–13 shows that
 productivity contributed 6.5 percentage points to growth in per capita value added (see figure 2; table
 1). However, the declining labor force participation rate knocked 3 percentage points off annual per
 capita income growth, whereas the slight rise in the working-age population and a tiny increase in
 employment relative to the size of the labor force—the labor force fell by even more than
 employment—added 1.1 percentage points to the annual growth in real GDP per capita.

     Fact 2: Workers left agriculture and industry for services, but the 2009 global
                    crisis dampened the job prospects in services

The structure of employment across sectors has changed dramatically over the past decade
as jobs disappeared in agriculture. Moldova has been characterized as an agricultural economy not
because of the share of GDP generated by the sector, but because of the share of the labor force that
was employed in the sector. At the start of the 2000s, 51 percent of employment was in agriculture.
However, in 2000–14, there was a 56 percent fall in the total number of jobs in agriculture, and the
share of jobs in agriculture to total jobs had dropped to 29 percent by 2012 (figure 5). Agriculture’s
share has risen slightly since then.
Not all the lost jobs were reallocated to other sectors. Prior to the global crisis in 2008–09,
industrial jobs had increased by 19 percent over the 2000s, but, beginning in 2008, they fell 16 percent,
ending slightly lower in 2013 than in 2000. Service sector employment grew by only a quarter relative
to the jobs lost in agriculture and was thus unable to offer jobs to all the workers leaving agriculture.
(Figure 6 shows that net job creation among registered firms was negative in all sectors after 2008.)
Since the global crisis, the rate of losses and gains by sector have flattened out, and the gains in
agriculture and services almost equaled the losses in industrial employment.
A share of the jobs lost in agriculture reflect a move to low-productivity agriculture. Much of
the agricultural employment in Moldova is on family-owned farms and a large share in semisubsistence
and subsistence farming.10 The 2011 general agricultural census revealed that more than half the farms
cultivate less than half of an hectare, and about 95 percent have an area less than three hectares and


10   Möllers et al. (2016).

10
occupy only 27 percent of the total agricultural land. Most of these smallholders have limited
opportunities and potential to commercialize and increase the size of their farms. 11 Over the past
years, the share of people in self-employment in agriculture for own consumption who are working less than 20
hours a week –currently excluded from official employment numbers-- rose from 15 percent of those
working in agriculture in 2007 to 24 percent in 2014. This suggests that a larger share of people —
mainly older people and the less well educated—were rapidly transitioning into unpaid, low-intensity
agricultural jobs.12
Although not capturing the full labor market, job creation patterns and trends among
registered firms provide an informative view of the effect of the crisis on labor markets in each
sector. Figure 7 shows that net job creation among registered firms economy-wide was negative. This
was particularly true in agriculture prior to 2009 and, to a lesser extent, in construction. Firms in the
rest of the economy started to shed jobs especially after the economy slumped during the global
financial crisis and have not rebounded since.

            Fact 3: Out-migration means that Moldova failed to fully capture a
           demographic dividend for the economy, and is now an aging country

Moldova has started aging quite rapidly. Figures 7 and 8 compare Moldova’s demographics of
the past 16 years with future projections, and display the growth rates by age-group. Figure 8 shows
growth only in the number of people over retirement age. The number of children below working age,
dropped by 35 percent from 2000-2016, faster than the decline in the number of working age people
(which fell by 13 percent between 2000 and 2016). Consequently, youthful dependency fell from 0.35
children per worker in 2000 to 0.24 per worker in 2010. While taking into account those above
retirement age, the ratio of working age Moldovans to total dependents peaked at 2.54 workers per
dependent in 2010. The retired population started to grow fast after 2010; by 6 percent between 2010

and 2016, and it is set to rise by 10% between 2010 and 2016 and by some 22% between 2020 and
2030. The UN thus projects that by 2030, Moldova will have only 1.84 workers per dependent. That
is a decline of 0.7 workers per dependent within just one generation. When a decline in dependency
is coupled with increased working age population, labor force participation and increased employment,
a ‘demographic dividend’ can support economic growth13. However, Moldova seems to have missed
out on this dividend to some extent. As working age Moldovans migrated out, labor force
participation and employment both fell at home.
Migration has reshaped Moldova’s workforce and the economy as a whole. Most of the
working-age population lives in rural areas, and, as figure 9 shows, the majority of emigrants are from
rural areas. This means that a widening share of the remaining Moldovan workforce is urban. Though
causality cannot be determined, this raises a question: which came first, the drop in agricultural
employment or the rise in emigration from rural areas? From 2000 to 2005, the number of emigrants
nearly quadrupled. By 2008, an estimated 40 percent of Moldovans of working age were living and
working abroad. Although the global financial crisis had a dampening effect on emigration, the
number of emigrants remained at around three times the number in 2000 and was creeping higher
(figure 9). Since 2010, Moldovans have continued to migrate abroad in search of more and better jobs;
especially people in the 25–34 age-group, who are typically considered the engines of growth in a
country. Were it not for out-migration, the working-age population in Moldova would have increased
throughout the period.
In essence, Moldova traded a demographic dividend for migrant remittances as the workforce
was gradually exported. Whereas the economy could have started enjoying a significant
demographic dividend, Moldova entered the millennium not with a booming labor force and
employment, but with booming migration and remittances.14 Remittances, pre-crisis, were more than
30 percent of GDP. However, because of the rising uncertainty of employment among labor migrants
to the Russian Federation and Western Europe in 2009, the GDP share of remittances fell to only 21
percent, before recovering to 24 percent by the middle of 2013 and steadying at 23.5 percent in 2015.15

14 A demographic dividend is a boost in economic growth that occurs when there are growing numbers of people in the

workforce relative to the number of dependents. In Moldova, population and labor force numbers are clouded by official
and informal out-migration, making interpretation difficult. Based on data of the United Nations and World Development
Indicators, the ratio of the working-age population to dependents rose from 2.0 to a peak of 2.5 in 2000–10. It is expected
to decline with aging to 2.3 in 2020 and 1.8 in 2030. See WDI (World Development Indicators) (database), World Bank,

                                         Jobs and inclusion

 Fact 4: Employment and wage patterns show that job outcomes are becoming
                              less inclusive

Jobs became less inclusive between 2006 and 2012. Women, the poor, youth, and rural
residents fared less well in the labor market as employment opportunities dried up. Women of
working age are more well educated than men, a gap that has widened in recent years. In 2012, 15.5
percent of women had completed postsecondary education, compared with 12.4 percent of men. In
the same year, slightly more women (93 percent) than men (90 percent) were likely to be formally
employed. While the portion of the population that is employed does not vary greatly by sex, the
portion of the population that is out of the labor force is strikingly different. Figure 10 provides a
breakdown between the sexes by consumption decile. The differences become more visible among
the higher deciles, most likely because married women in richer households may choose not to work.
However, women who do work can expect to earn significantly less than their male counterparts, an
average sex wage gap of 17 percent has persisted.16
The majority of people in the bottom deciles are in elementary occupations with less earning power.
The share of youth employment (ages 15–24 years) across consumption deciles is highest at the lower
levels of earnings, most likely because the poorer young people cannot afford not to work. Once
employed, these youth are more likely to be in informal employment than adults.17
Disparities in job opportunities and occupations are affected by educational attainment.
People with no education or only primary education have remained in agriculture, and an increasing
share in the informal sector over the years, where earnings are lowest (figure 11).18 Jobs in the informal
sector are almost unheard among people with postsecondary educational attainment. These
differences also appear in wages. People with primary education earn 50 percent more than those with
no education, and those with postsecondary education earn 90 percent more than those no
education.19
Rural areas are mostly associated with inactivity and jobs in agriculture. Controlling for all
individual- and household-level characteristics, wage regressions show that Chisinau has 52–55
percent higher earnings relative to the central region.20 The north has 11 percent lower earnings, and
this does not change after controlling for industry or occupation. The south has 27–29 percent lower
earnings. The gap between the central region and the south decreases only slightly by industry and
occupation. Wage differences across regions also vary by sex. An average woman (given observable
characteristics) in the north earns about 8 percent less than her counterpart in the central region, while

this difference is 16 percent for a man. Similarly, women in the south earn 23 percent less than women
in the central region, while men in the south earn 36 percent less than their counterparts in the central
region. In Chisinau, the wage premium among men and women are 57 percent and 52 percent,
respectively.21

Moreover, the pattern of job destruction disproportionately affected low-skilled rural workers.
Rural areas were hardest hit by falling employment and rising inactivity; agricultural employment and
female employment probabilities fell significantly (annex figure A1). Analysis of firms in the Firm
Survey dataset shows that only firms in Chisinau did not see a drop-off in jobs, on average, in 2004–
14.


         Fact 5: Despite their rising educational attainments, young people face
                      significant challenges finding non-farm jobs

The poorest are being left behind and relegated to less profitable sectors of the economy. The
bottom 40 are more likely to be self-employed farmers, in elementary occupations in skilled
agriculture, or in crafts, and the majority are in agriculture (figure 12). The number of people employed
in agriculture sector has been decreasing since 2000.
Young people are seeking other jobs. By 2012, the share of the labor force over the age of 24
engaged in self-employed agriculture was 18.5 percent, while the share ages 15–24 engaged in the same
activity was only 11.7 percent (figure 13). Additionally, the share of youth in public wage jobs was
smaller than the corresponding share ages 24 or older, at 18 percent and 29 percent, respectively.
Nearly 46 percent of young workers were concentrated in private sector wage jobs.

The educational attainment of youth is rising, but youth face significant challenges in finding
jobs. In 2006, 24 percent of men had achieved only primary education or less, but, by 2012, this had
dropped to 21 percent. Among women, the rate fell from 26 percent to 21 percent during the same
period. However, as youth became more well educated, they still faced uncertain employment options.
In 2006, around one-fifth of youth, starting at about 20 years of age, were not engaged in employment,
education, or training (figures 14 and 15). In 2015, the rate rose to nearly one-third of all youth,
irrespective of sex. Both young women and men are taking longer to transition to work and were more
likely in 2015 than in 2005 to transition from school to inactivity. Young men were increasingly likely
to fall into inactivity, perhaps because the only sector generating net new jobs was the services. This
problem is not restricted to youth without education, though these were disproportionately
overrepresented among those who are inactive. Youth with postsecondary education were also
represented in inactivity at higher rates than the overall population.
From 2000 to 2016, the working-age population decreased by an estimated 13 percent, while the 65+
age-group expanded by 6 percent. The result of a growing retiree population, plus a decreasing
working-age population because of migration, should have been to create greater employment
prospects for those gradually more well educated young people staying in Moldova. Yet, the opposite
seems to be true: while youth were staying longer in schools, the proportion of youth ages 15–24 who
were neither in school nor working increased between 2006 and 2015.

     Fact 6: As inequality in earnings widens, post-secondary education still earns
                more, but is becoming less of a guarantee of a better job

There are labor market inequalities in earnings. The use of regression analysis (Mincerian log,
nominal) on earnings among wage workers in 2012 (see the annex for results) show that (1) women
earned less than men; this gender gap diminishes when adjusted for sectors and occupations, but stays
at 11 percent; (2) older people earned more than younger people, perhaps because of experience or
stability in the job; (3) education pays: people with postsecondary education earn significantly more
than people with no education (but not people with secondary education after adjusting for
occupation); and (4) urban jobs and work in industry (but not services) pay more than rural agricultural
work.
Inequalities seem to be widening. Comparing Mincerian returns over time among wage workers,
rural earnings fell further behind urban earnings between 2006 and 2012.22 In 2006, rural earnings
were 22–28 percent lower than urban earnings, whereas, by 2012, they were between 32 percent and
38 percent lower. Similarly, within urban areas, earnings in Chisinau are not only higher than
elsewhere, but the wage gaps were widening: compared with the central region, the wage premium in
Chisinau had risen from 38–40 percent to 52–55 percent. In terms of educational attainment, the skills
gap seems to be narrowing over time among people with postsecondary education, but remains robust
for secondary education, while the premium of industry wages over agricultural wages has widened.
However the premium of service wages over agriculture did not widen, and public wages fell further
behind private wages, on average. That urban service jobs—the only types of jobs for which firms
were hiring over the period—did not see a widening in wages relative to rural agricultural jobs and
that, adjusting for occupations, the skills gaps did not widen may be indicative of an oversupply of


22   World Bank calculations.

17
postsecondary skills in urban services relative to the relevant labor demand and a tightening in rural
labor markets as unskilled and semiskilled workers migrate. This result may suggest that postsecondary
graduates in urban areas may be relatively underemployed over time in lower wage service jobs (such
as retail trade and the hospitality industry). Those people who find a profession or a technical or a
clerical job may be able to reap the skills gap, but others may not be able to do so. If there were
sufficient demand for skills in the economy, but an insufficient supply of skills, this would show up in
a relatively greater number of the unskilled facing underemployment, while foreigners take the higher-
end jobs in the economy. There is little evidence of this.
The findings suggest that the key job challenge in Moldova may be a lack of demand for
labor, although matching skills to labor market demands is likely also a problem.

                                          Demand for labor

     Fact 7: Efficient firms are raising productivity by shedding jobs, not creating
                    them, while firm entry and survival rates are low

So why did the prospects among more well educated young people not seem to improve in an
economy in which the labor force was shrinking through out-migration? The reasons seem to lie in a
reduced demand for labor. The following messages rely on data on registered firms to explore the
demand side of the labor market. This data under-reports agricultural workers, because it excludes
informal household farming. There is coverage across all sectors for firms that file taxes. The data
suggests two thirds of employment falls into eight two-digit product categories23; retail and wholesale
trade (14 and 11 percent), land transport (10 percent), manufacturing of food (9 percent) beverages (4
percent) clothing (5 percent), crop and animal farming (7 percent) and construction (5 percent).
In line with the macroeconomic trends, firms shed jobs and experienced an overall increase
in productivity during the survey period. The increases in productivity were observed whether the
productivity is measured as output per worker, value added per worker, or total factor productivity
(figure 16). However, over the same period, firms reported negative net job creation, meaning that
businesses were shedding jobs more quickly than they were creating them (figure 17).

How did increased productivity come about? To understand how, the analysis looks at dynamic
allocative efficiency, explores the extent to which changes in aggregate firm productivity has been
derived from firms that became more productive by expanding and from firms that became less
productive by contracting.24 The results, presented in figure 18, show the following:

        The positive within-firm productivity growth term shows that surviving firms, independent
         of their labor share, became more productive over the period, with the exception of the
         years 2004 and 2012.
        Between-firm productivity effects, which occur when more (less) productive firms increase
         (decrease) their employment share, were mostly positive, but relatively small. This is the
         important term to highlight: productive firms were not able or willing to increase their
         share of the labor market; instead the greatest productivity gains arose from within-firm
         increases in productivity.
        Nonetheless, the positive gains to productivity from the between term are nearly cancelled out
         by the negative cross term. The negative cross term indicates that firms that were becoming
         more productive were decreasing their employment share in the firm census. This term had a
         negative impact on productivity across nearly all the years from 2003 to 2014, suggesting that,
         as firms became more productive, they shed labor, or, alternatively, firms may have
         become more productive by downsizing.
        The entry of new firms generated few productivity gains, while the exit of firms generally
         generated mostly negligent positive gains to changes in productivity indicating that inefficient
         firms did exit, but not nearly enough did so to make a difference.

Fact 8: The most productive firms (small, young, foreign, and private) have the
 most productive jobs, but they are not increasing their share in employment

                                 Table 2. Labor Productivity Regression Results (see the annex)
For workers who remained in
Moldova and managed to stay
employed, better jobs generally
became available. Productivity, as
measured by value added per worker,
output per worker, and total factor
productivity, was rising in all sectors,
as well as across most firm age and
size categories. However, Fact 7
reveals a productivity conundrum: the
most productive firms are not hiring
more employees.
Zooming into the profile of
productive firms shows distinctive
patterns. First, productivity is highest
among smaller firms, younger firms,
foreign and private firms, commerce
and services, and firms in Chisinau
(table 2). Second, regressions show
that productivity growth is also higher
among small firms, young firms, and
firms participating in the agricultural
sector. The last means that the
movement of labor out of agriculture
into urban centers and into jobs in
firms in commerce and in foreign
firms, or out of the country altogether
has been productivity- and growth-
enhancing for the agricultural sector,
as well as for the commerce sector and
foreign-owned firms.
However, as seen in fact 7, growth in
productivity does not appear to be
correlated with employment size. Part of the reason for this is that as overall employment in Moldova
was decreasing after 2008, employment in majority publically owned firms first increased slightly and
then remained stable. More productive domestic private firms were fewer and shrinking in
employment share after 2008, whereas the average size of a majority public firm increased. The

21
regressions in table 1 show that relative to domestic private firms, public firms are significantly less
productive, and hence the relative shift in labor shares towards publically owned firms would have
been productivity reducing. As discussed in key fact 10, World Bank (2012 and 2014) show that public
companies have greater access to State Aid, and so face significantly cheaper costs of financing than
domestic private firms.

     Fact 9: While productivity is increasing, a growing share of jobs is in less-
                                   productive firms

The more-productive firms are smaller. Regression analysis of firm size suggests that, within the
same year, location (district level), and industry (2-digit level), the more-productive firms—measured
by value added per worker—are smaller. The same results, though with a smaller magnitude of
coefficients, apply in examining firm employment growth and firm employment growth with fixed
effects. The results show that the average effect of a within-firm increase in productivity by 10 percent
contracts a firm by between 0.017 percent and 0.033 percent, a small magnitude, but significant and
negative nonetheless.
There is no relationship between firm productivity and employment size. Figure 20 graphs the
allocation of labor with respect to total factor productivity with the aim of displaying the allocation
efficiency between employment and productivity, meaning more employment is allocated to more
productive firms. A positive slope would be deemed healthy because it would indicate a positive
relationship between employment size and productivity. Over the whole of the economy, however,
the relationship between firm productivity and hiring is mostly flat, with a small spike upward at the
tail. Indeed, only firms involved in commerce have a positive slope, while agriculture has a steeply
negative slope, and the remaining sectors are mostly flat with downward movements.

  Fact 10: Firms providing employment are typically larger and older, while
 younger firms are struggling, and fewer new firms have been launched since
                                  the crisis

In the years leading up to the 2008–09 global financial crisis, the economy witnessed an
increase in microfirms, but these were deeply affected by the crisis. In 2008, at the peak of such
firms, they comprised nearly 19 percent of all registered firms in the country. However, the rate
dropped quickly because of the impact of the crisis and has not yet recovered to precrisis levels. The
largest firms were able to weather the crisis: firms of of 500 or more employees never accounted for
less than 20 percent of all employment, and firms with 50 or more employees always included 60
percent or more of the employees in the workforce.
Firms have continued to age, and older firms have increased their dominance in employment
share. In 2003, nonfarm employment in registered firms was spread across a variety of firms, varying
in size and age; the majority of workers were in young to middle-age firms (figure 21). The majority
of firms—more than 75 percent—had less than 10 employees and were neither young nor old, but in
between. Firms 10 years or older only accounted for 30 percent of the employment share, not so
surprising given that the country had only declared independence a decade earlier. By 2014, firms in
the same age bracket accounted for over 70 percent of all firms in the country, and large firms
dominated the employment landscape (figure 22). Entry-level firms (a year old) and young firms (ages
2–5 years) accounted for a negligible portion of the overall employment in registered firms (figure 22).

Employment in registered firms at entry is low, well below 5 percent by sector, and there were
few entrants during the financial crisis (figure 23). However, new service firms appear to have

24
been launched in 2011, and employment shares were again rising in services, commerce, mining,
utilities, and construction in 2013. Employment among these entrants dropped dramatically during
the crisis and has been slow to recover, further adding to the dominance of larger and older firms in
employment. Figure 24 illustrates how microfirms contributed over 60 percent of the jobs created by
entrants firms in 2008, but only 20 percent in 2014. In fact, since the crisis, a growing share of job
creation among entrants has been associated with larger entrants.

Not only do small firms struggle to enter the market, but, once they enter, they must struggle
to survive. The rate of exit among young entrants is high. Between 2003 and 2014, 55.6 percent of
firms with less than 10 employees exited before they were 5 years old, and 50 percent disappeared
within three years (table 3). The data suggest that the crisis took a disproportionate toll on these firms
and that they have not recovered since. But, like job losses, high rates of early exit were already an
issue precrisis.
Moreover, there is little upward movement among size categories (table 3). In fact, a higher
percentage of firms that have 10 to 19 employees at birth shrink to less than 10 employees (21 percent)
than those that grow to 20 or more employees (18 percent) by the age of 5, while the exit rate is even
higher (35 percent). Additionally, a safety-in-size theme emerges from a look at the exit rates of firms:
firms with 100+ employees exhibit an exit rate of only 6 percent at any moment three years later, while
half of all microfirms closed their doors during the same period.

cannot identify financing sources and must rely on the scarce funding options subsidized either by the
government or international organizations. Larger public companies are more likely to receive public
money or state aid.26 However, World Bank (2016) points to significant governance-related challenges
that affect firms across the board in Moldova and, potentially, the more vulnerable microfirms.

                                                Conclusions

Moldova could have achieved faster poverty reduction if job creation by firms had been
healthier. As the analysis shows, the economy grew quickly, while experiencing net job losses. Jobs
got more attractive because of productivity gains in services and agriculture, and a structural change
away from agriculture and into services up until the global crisis. Following the crisis, job loss occurred
across all sectors. People fortunate enough to have a job are seeing their earnings rise, especially in
industry, which, however, is not creating more jobs, and in Chisinau. These people not only receive
higher wages; but are also more likely to have job contracts, health insurance, and pensions. The few
jobs that exist are getting better on average. The problem now is how to expand the number of these
better jobs.
The economy is heading in the wrong direction, and development opportunities are being
missed. The economy is currently in the midst of a growth-enhancing demographic dividend, but is
exporting its workforce. Young, women, informal, and rural workers are becoming less likely to find
work, and their labor earnings (already lower) are falling further behind. The result is that the labor
force is not being maximized, and an already precarious situation among the most vulnerable is
becoming riskier. The pattern in the dynamics of employment means that jobs outcomes are becoming
less inclusive. This is almost certainly the motivation for out-migration, which continues to rise,
especially among people starting families (ages 25–34) and transiting out of school.
More and higher-productivity jobs need to be created especially in the private sector and
particularly because the population is aging. At present, entrant firms are starting smaller (which
is normal). It is these small, young firms that are most productive.27 However, these young small firms
are experiencing high exit rates, and nearly two-thirds have closed within the first five years. The
resulting economic landscape is dominated by larger and older firms, which show lower employment
growth rates. The finding that older, unproductive firms do not exit, while younger ones do is
troublesome and may arise because of market competition and asymmetric access to finance.
Significant challenges persist among firms in creating jobs and more equitable access to
economic opportunities. As described in World Bank (2016), Moldova needs to (1) strengthen the
rule of law and the accountability of institutions, particularly to unlock the main constraint identified
to firm growth and job creation; (2) improve the efficiency and equity of service delivery to establish
an enabling environment for firms and individuals to gain access to better economic opportunities,
especially in rural areas; and (3) increase the quality, equity, and relevance of education and training
systems, so that Moldovans may become well prepared to access productive jobs. Priority areas also
include (4) improving the business regulatory framework, (5) ensuring sound macroeconomic and
fiscal management, and (6) reforming the social protection system, particularly pensions.
Regional benchmarks confirm these challenges. The final section of the annex to this report
provides benchmarks on key aspects of Moldova’s labor regulations, investment climate and worker
education. In summary, Moldova is a regional poor performer on control of corruption, construction

productivity.

permits, insolvency, enforcing contracts, and labor market regulations. Whereas the education of
workers in Moldova is mid-ranking for the region, the minimum wage in Moldova is relatively low.
This reflects Moldova’s low per capita income. However, the minimum wage is high relative to average
value added per worker, meaning that despite having relatively high years of education workers in
Moldova have lower productivity (and lower wages)28. In addition Moldovan workers receive more
stability and better terms and conditions. Severance pay is generous compared to the region, as is the
increment for night work. Gradual loosening of labor regulations may make Moldovan workers more
attractive in future. However, it seems from the analysis of this job diagnostic that the sequence of
reforms should start with improvements to the trade and investment climate in Moldova, which calls
for addressing pressing governance-related challenges (see World Bank, 2016). This would increase
the demand for labor. A second priority is to improve the vocational relevance of Moldova’s systems
for education and skills training, as skills will be all the more important as Moldova’s workforce
continues to shrink.




28
   Regressions show that for Moldovan firms, average labor costs per worker correlate with firm level productivity, even
after accounting for fixed effects.
