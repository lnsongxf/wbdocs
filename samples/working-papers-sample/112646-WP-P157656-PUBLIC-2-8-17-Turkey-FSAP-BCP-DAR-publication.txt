INTRODUCTION 1
1.      This assessment of the current state of implementation of the Basel Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision (BCPs) in Turkey has been completed as a part of a Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) undertaken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank during 2016. It reflects the regulatory and supervisory framework in place as of
the date of the completion of the assessment. It is not intended to represent an analysis of the state
of the banking sector or the crisis management framework, which have been addressed in the broad
exercise.
2.       The Banking Regulation and Supervisory Authority (BRSA) as a member of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), is committed to the adoption of international
standards and sound practices promulgated by the BCBS, as well as other relevant
international standard-setting bodies. The BRSA has implemented, or is in the process of
implementing, all of the BCBS standards, most notably those related to capital adequacy and
liquidity with a high level of compliance. The BRSA is to be commended for its ongoing commitment
to adhering to the highest standards for supervision and regulation.
3.       Since the previous assessment conducted in 2011, the BRSA has made several
significant improvements to its supervisory framework. Turkey has built a good foundation for
banking supervision. The Banking Law (BL) provides a broadly appropriate supervision framework
with clear responsibilities and necessary supervisory powers. The established methodology for
banking supervision is comprehensive and grounded on extensive databases and on regulation
largely in compliance with international standards. The BRSA has also made vast efforts to improve
consolidated supervision, organizing supervisory colleges, signing a number of important
Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) and removing obstacles for the supervision of Turkish
banks operations in foreign countries.
4.      There are areas that still warrant improvement. These include, among others, addressing
legal provisions that undermines supervisory independence, providing a deeper risk assessment
focus to supervisory inspections and follow up, enhancing the forward looking component of the
assessments, streamlining risk management and corporate governance requirements, strengthening
the asset quality examination process and the accuracy of classification therein, strengthening the
supervisory enforcement regime, demanding recovery plans, developing group resolution plans and
increasing the ability to act at an early stage to address unsafe and unsound practices.
5.        The Assessment has been conducted in accordance with the revised BCP assessment
methodology approved by the Basel Committee. The Turkey supervisory regime was assessed
and rated against the Essential Criteria (EC). The methodology requires that the assessment be
based on (i) the legal and other documentary evidence; (ii) the work of the supervisory authority;
and (iii) its implementation in the banking sector. Full compliance requires that all these
prerequisites are met. The guidelines allow that a country may fulfill the compliance criteria in a
different manner from those suggested, as long as it can prove that the overriding objectives of

each Core Principle (CP) are achieved. Conversely, countries may sometimes be required to fulfill
more than the minimum standards, such as in the event of structural weaknesses in that country.
The methodology also states that the assessment is to be made on the factual situation of the date
when the assessment is completed. However, where applicable, the assessors made note of
regulatory initiatives that have yet to be completed or implemented.
6.      The conclusions are based on extensive discussions with staff members of the BRSA
and a review of related regulation and internal supervisory documents. The mission reviewed
the BCP self-assessment undertaken by BRSA preceding this assessment, and detailed responses to
a questionnaire addressing supervisory issues. The mission also reviewed a number of laws
governing banking supervision powers and activities, including the BL and a number of regulations
and decisions addressing prudential standards and risk management requirements. Special attention
was given to inspection reports. The mission also held meetings with senior officials of local banks,
an external auditing firm and a credit rating agency. A representative from the Turkish Treasury was
present at all meetings.
7.       An assessment of compliance with the CP is not, and is not intended to be, an exact
science. Reaching conclusions require judgments by the assessment team. Banking systems differ
from one country to another, as do domestic circumstances. Also, banking activities are changing
rapidly around the world after the crisis and theories, policies and best practices are evolving rapidly.
Nevertheless, by adhering to a common agreed methodology, the assessment should provide the
Turkish authorities with an internationally consistent measure of quality of their banking supervision
relative to the 2012 revision of the Core Principles, which are internationally recognized as minimum
standards.
8.      The assessors appreciated the cooperation received from the BRSA. The team sincerely
thanks the staff of the BRSA for their high professionalism, for the spirit of active cooperation and
for making enormous efforts to attend the information requests of the team.

INSTITUTIONAL AND MARKET STRUCTURE—
OVERVIEW
9.      The Turkish financial sector is supervised by three main regulatory and supervisory
authorities. The BRSA is the regulatory and supervisory authority for the banking industry as well as
financial leasing, factoring, financial holding companies, electronic money institutions, consumer
financing, some payment systems institutions and asset management companies; the Capital
Markets Board of Turkey (CMB) is the regulatory and supervisory authority for the securities markets;
the General Directorate of Insurance and the Insurance Supervisory Board operating under the
Undersecretariat of Treasury (Treasury) are responsible for the insurance sector. The other
authorities that have a role in the regulation and supervision of the banking system are the Central
Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) as the monetary authority, the Financial Crimes Investigation
Board (MASAK) as the authority for anti-money laundering (AML) and combating financing of
terrorism (CFT); and the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) as the deposit insurance and bank
resolution authority.

10.      Banks, holding over 90 percent of the financial system by asset ownership, are vital to
financial stability in Turkey. Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) are small by peer emerging
market levels, with insurance and pension fund assets constituting less than two percent each of the
sector (Figure 1). Capital market intermediation remains small. The overall financial system is about
122 percent of 2015 gross domestic product (GDP) by assets and has been growing significantly
faster than GDP since 2008.
11.     The banking system is of average size, although the proportion of credit financed by
non-deposit channels is larger than in peer emerging markets (Figure 2, panels A—B).
Concentration is not significant and market share is equally distributed among private domestic,
foreign-owned, and state-owned banks (Figure 2; panels C—D). Acquisition-based entry by foreign
banks in recent years has led to a substantial increase in their asset ownership share. By the end of
December 2015, there are 34 deposit taking banks, 5 participation banks and 13 development and
investment banks under the BRSA’s supervision.
12.     Capital adequacy has declined over the past five years but remains relatively high in
relation to international standards (Table 1). As nonperforming loans (NPLs) have been broadly
constant around some 3 percent of gross lending since 2012, the deterioration in capital adequacy
and returns owes to a combination of rapid balance-sheet expansion with a reorientation of lending
towards lower margin corporate lending and a policy induced squeeze on retail credit margins.

PRECONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE BANKING
SUPERVISION
Macroeconomic and Financial Sector Policies
13.      The financial sector operates in an uncertain economic environment. Growth is
dependent on external finance. During 2016, domestic demand and growth are expected to remain
relatively robust due to a 30 percent minimum wage increase, relaxation of macro prudential
regulations, and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Nevertheless, the domestic savings
rate is low, creating a dependence on external funds and making the economy vulnerable to
external shocks. Inflation has also remained high and above target.
14.     External imbalances demand attention. While the oil price decline and economic
slowdown have attenuated the current account deficit, it is expected to rise again if these factors
reverse going forward. It may rise also if term premia and funding costs decompress as the U.S.
begins monetary policy normalization. Against this backdrop, the external position demands
attention. External debt is high (at about 60 percent of GDP) and concentrated in private sector
hands, annual financing needs are high (about 27 percent of GDP), capital inflows are mainly short-
tenor and debt creating, the net international investment position (NIIP), at about -50 percent of
GDP is weak by international standards, and net foreign exchange (FX) reserves, at US$29 billion, are
low.
15.      Macroprudential policies are coordinated through the Financial Stability Committee
(FSC). The FSC is composed of the heads of all the major agencies having a stake in the
maintenance of financial stability; viz., the Undersecretary of Treasury and the heads of the CBRT,
BRSA,CMB and SDIF, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the
Undersecretariat of the Treasury. The 2015 Financial Stability Board (FSB) Peer Review concluded
that the FSC has helped to promote information sharing and the exchange of views as well as to
coordinate some policy measures among its member institutions. Importantly, the authorities have a
broad range of tools at their disposal and have used them in a proactive and flexible manner in
recent years to slow down the rise in household leverage and to encourage banks to increase core
funding. At the same time, further steps were identified to strengthen the framework in a number of
areas such as integrating the systemic risk assessment and policy framework and improving
institutional arrangements and public communication.
Public Infrastructure
16.    Business laws are based on the Civil Law, dated 8/2001 and the New Turkish
Commercial Code (TCC), dated July, 2012. The Code of Obligations, 2011, and the Competition
Law, No. 4054, 1994, also form the framework of business laws as do the Law on the Protection of
the Consumer No. 6502, 2014, and the Execution and Bankruptcy Code (EBC) of 1932 (amended
2003/4).
17.    The New TCC was promulgated 2012. The New TCC aims to harmonize the Turkish and
European Union Laws in order to strengthen foreign economic relations. One of the new features



                                                                                                   15
TURKEY



increased transparency by requiring stock companies to create a website dedicated to publishing all
data relevant for shareholders, such as annual and interim financial statements and audit reports.
The new TCC also aimed to reinforce the rights of shareholder and corporate governance.
18.      The basic principles of the independence of courts and security of judges and public
prosecutors are provided in the Constitution. The Turkish legal system does not provide for
special courts for dealing with bank or financial sector related cases, however in some big cities
specific courts are identified to deal only with banking related cases.
19.     All listed and non-listed companies are obliged to apply financial reporting standards
issued by the Public Oversight Accounting and Auditing Standards Authority (POA). POA
issues Turkish Accounting Standards (TAS) and Turkish Financial Reporting Standards (TFRS) which
correspond, respectively, to the International Accounting Standards (IAS) and the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The authorities explained that the main difference between the implementation of IFRS and TFRS in
Turkish banks is in loan loss provisioning. For loan loss provisioning, the Turkish banks apply the
BRSA’s REPL instead of the impairment requirements of TAS 39 or IAS 39. The BRSA is planning to
apply IFRS 9, including the provision rules, from 1 January 2017. By 2017, Turkish banks will be able
to recognize provisions for credit losses in accordance with TFRS 9 which is considered by the
Turkish authorities to be fully compliant with the IFRS 9 with the option of the recent amendments
to the REPL. The last amendment entitles the banks to use existing provisions of the REPL or to
apply TFRS 9. The auditing of companies is carried out in compliance with international auditing
standards by independent auditors who meet the professional competence requirements.
20.     The companies which are subject to independent audit are determined in the TCC. In
addition, the companies which fall under the Capital Markets Law or the BL are automatically subject
to the independent auditing requirement, whereas the companies such as the license holding
companies operating under the regulations of the Energy Market Regulatory Authority and public
companies under the Capital Markets Law are subject to the independent auditing requirement only
if they meet certain criteria. The external auditing firms which meet the required criteria are
authorized by POA. On the other hand, external audit activities conducted in banks and other
financial institutions are also subject to the BL and REAB.
21.     Payment and settlement systems in Turkey are well developed with a sound legal and
regulatory framework and with the roles of regulators and overseers clearly established. The
Overseers of the FMIs in Turkey are the CBRT and the CMB. In addition, the BRSA has responsibility
for payment services, payment institutions, and electronic money. The authorities have been
systematically reforming the National Payments System in Turkey covering implementation of the
necessary infrastructure, internal organization arrangements and strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework, and have achieved several critical National Payments System (NPS)
objectives—most notably, as the result of on-going modernization efforts. A conducive legal and
regulatory framework and the core components of the NPS are in place.
22.     There is one credit bureau operating in Turkey. The Credit Registry Bureau, (CRB-KKB)
was founded in 1995 as a private enterprise with the initiative of The Banks Association of Turkey
(BAT) and partnership of 11 leading banks of the sector to facilitate the exchange of information and


16
                                                                                                 TURKEY



documents between credit institutions and financial institutions. Banking Law no: 5411 Article 73/4
grants special permission to the CRB to collect information from member institutions and to
facilitate exchange of this information. In order to gather risk information about customers of credit
institutions and other financial institutions, the Risk Center was established as a part of BAT in 2012.
BAT and CRB signed a service contract, with the approval of the BRSA, in order to carry out all
operations of the Risk Center in December 2012.
23.      Statistical information availability is extensive in the Turkish banking system. The BRSA
publishes regularly (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual) data on bank and non-bank financial
institutions. Data cover balance sheet, income statement, loans, consumer loans, SME loans, as well
as deposits by type and maturity. Also fees and commissions faced by financial customers are also
published on BRSA’s web site as a tool to strengthen market discipline. Deposit interest rates and
price quotes about financial markets are available on a daily basis and are provided by related
monetary, banking and financial market regulators.
24.      The banking supervisor works closely with the deposit insurer and central bank on
crisis management issues. The previous FSAP mission highlighted the broad range of measures
that the BRSA has at its disposal to mitigate bank vulnerabilities, found the CBRT’s framework for the
provision of emergency liquidity to be sound and characterized the SDIF as broadly conforming to
best international practice. The 2015 FSB Peer Review for Turkey, 2 found that the absence of certain
resolution powers—such as bridge banks, bail-in powers and temporary stays of early termination
rights—may make it difficult for the authorities to resolve the largest banks in the system in a timely
and cost-effective manner. The review also pointed out that, impediments to cross-border
cooperation can challenge the effective resolution of banks with cross-border operations, while a
lack of recovery and resolution planning requirements undermines resolution preparedness. The
Turkish authorities have informed the mission that they are currently working to align the Turkish
resolution framework with the FSB Key Attributes for Resolution Regimes.

DETAILED ASSESSMENT
 A.    Supervisory Powers, Responsibilities, and Functions
 Principle 1             Responsibilities, objectives and powers. An effective system of banking supervision has
                         clear responsibilities and objectives for each authority involved in the supervision of
                         banks and banking groups. 3 A suitable legal framework for banking supervision is in place
                         to provide each responsible authority with the necessary legal powers to authorize banks,
                         conduct ongoing supervision, address compliance with laws and undertake timely
                         corrective actions to address safety and soundness concerns. 4

Essential criteria

EC1                  The responsibilities and objectives of each of the authorities involved in banking
                     supervision 5 are clearly defined in legislation and publicly disclosed. Where more than one
                     authority is responsible for supervising the banking system, a credible and publicly available
                     framework is in place to avoid regulatory and supervisory gaps.

Description and      The Banking Law No. 5411 (BL) establishes the BRSA as being responsible for the
findings re EC1      supervision and regulation of the banking industry as well as financial leasing, factoring and
                     consumer financing companies in Turkey.

                     The other authorities that have a role in the regulation and supervision of the financial
                     system are:

                     -          CBRT as a monetary authority;

                     -          MASAK as a specialized anti-money laundering entity established to prevent
                     money laundering and to detect anti-money laundering offences;

                     -          Treasury as the insurance supervisor;

                     -          SDIF, as the responsible for deposit insurance and banking resolution;

                     -          CMB, as responsible for the securities industry and the mortgage finance
                     corporations (MFCs).

                     Responsibilities of each entity are well established with small room for overlap or regulatory
                     gap.




3 Inthis document, “banking group” includes the holding company, the bank and its offices, subsidiaries, affiliates and
joint ventures, both domestic and foreign. Risks from other entities in the wider group, for example non-bank (including
non-financial) entities, may also be relevant. This group-wide approach to supervision goes beyond accounting
consolidation.
4 The activities of authorising banks, ongoing supervision and corrective actions are elaborated in the subsequent

Principles.
5 Such authority is called “the supervisor” throughout this paper, except where the longer form “the banking supervisor”

has been necessary for clarification.

                                                                                                                  TURKEY



EC 2                   The primary objective of banking supervision is to promote the safety and soundness of
                       banks and the banking system. If the banking supervisor is assigned broader
                       responsibilities, these are subordinate to the primary objective and do not conflict with it.

Description and        Article 93 of the BL establishes that the BRSA is responsible “for the establishment of
findings re EC2        confidence and stability in financial markets, the sound operation of the credit system, the
                       development of the financial sector and the protection of the rights and interests of
                       depositors”. The BL also obligates the BRSA “to prevent any transaction and practice that
                       could endanger the rights of the depositors and the sound and safe operation of banks
                       and severely damage the economy; and to take and implement the decisions and measures
                       in order to ensure the efficient operation of the credit system”.

                       The concept of “sound operation of the credit system” is not further developed. Nevertheless,
                       considering the role of the BRSA in the development of the financial sector, article 94 of the
                       BL states that the BRSA should ensure the profitable, efficient and rational operation of banks;
                       ensure competitiveness of the financial system; closely following up the status of international
                       banks in terms of supervision; ensure the integration of professional in the financial market;
                       and prepare the regulations pertaining to financial markets.

                       The BL does not distinguish among the objectives and seems to assign the same hierarchy to
                       the financial stability and development of the financial sector objectives. The assessors noted
                       that some BRSA decisions (e.g., loan loss provisions for some products, loan restructuring
                       rules) might be interpreted as rules that aim primarily to support financial development
                       objectives, despite the fact that the BRSA considers that some of them are within the scope of
                       macroprudential policy.

EC3                    Laws and regulations provide a framework for the supervisor to set and enforce minimum
                       prudential standards for banks and banking groups. The supervisor has the power to
                       increase the prudential requirements for individual banks and banking groups based on
                       their risk profile 6 and systemic importance. 7

Description and        The BL empowers BRSA to set and enforce minimum prudential standards. The BL (art. 43)
findings re EC3        also states that the Board is authorized to set more cautious different minimum or
                       maximum standard ratios or limits from those set for each bank or banking groups or to
                       change the calculation and reporting periods, or to set ratios or limits that have not been
                       set in general terms. This provision is applicable both on a consolidated and non-
                       consolidated basis. Please refer to CP16 for example of practical application of these
                       powers.

                  from banks and on the evaluation criteria that will be considered on examinations carried
                  out by the agency. These guidelines follow the principle of proportionality in the sense that
                  banks are expected to implement the principles according to the banks' own scales, risk
                  profiles, activities, volume, nature and complexity of their business and transactions.

EC4               Banking laws, regulations and prudential standards are updated as necessary to ensure that
                  they remain effective and relevant to changing industry and regulatory practices. These are
                  subject to public consultation, as appropriate.

Description and   The BL was established in 2005 and has been updated several times. The BRSA is authorized
findings re EC4   to issue regulations and communiqués through Board decisions to ensure that all rules and
                  regulations remain effective and relevant to changing industry and regulatory practices. The
                  agency has done so frequently to implement international standards, including Basel II/III,
                  and update the regulation appropriately.

                  According to the BL, the drafts of the secondary legislation (regulation and communiqués)
                  prepared by the BRSA need to be made public for a minimum seven days consultation
                  period to inform the public opinion and collect suggestions. In practice the period is usually
                  longer.

EC5               The supervisor has the power to:

                  a)   have full access to banks’ and banking groups’ Boards, management, staff and records
                       in order to review compliance with internal rules and limits as well as external laws and
                       regulations;
                  b)   review the overall activities of a banking group, both domestic and cross-border; and
                  c)   Supervise the activities of foreign banks incorporated in its jurisdiction.

Description and   On access to banks, the BL (art. 43, 93, 95) empowers the BRSA to have access to banks and
findings re EC5   banking group’s information for supervisory purposes. Banks are required to provide the
                  BRSA, timely and properly, any consolidated and non-consolidated information, document,
                  report or financial statements. The documents should be consistent with their accounts and
                  record keeping systems, within the framework set forth by the BRSB. BRSA supervisors also
                  have access to the staff of the banks including the board of directors.

                  On review the overall activities of the banking group, reporting and supervision
                  requirements prescribed in the regulations covers consolidated activities of banks, including
                  their cross-border activities. According to article 96 of the BL, the regulated institutions and
                  their shareholders and subsidiaries shall provide the BRSA with any information and
                  document, including those classified as confidential, if requested by the BRSA. The
                  requirements include parent banks as well as their domestic and foreign subsidiaries, their
                  jointly-controlled undertakings, their branches and representative offices.

                  On the supervision of foreign banks, Turkish banking legislation, does not separate
                  regulatory and supervisory framework according to ownership. In this context, foreign

                  banks established and operating in Turkey are subject to the same prudential, supervisory
                  and regulatory rules applied to domestic banks.

EC6               When, in a supervisor’s judgment, a bank is not complying with laws or regulations, or it is
                  or is likely to be engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or actions that have the potential
                  to jeopardize the bank or the banking system, the supervisor has the power to:

                  a)   take (and/or require a bank to take) timely corrective action;
                  b)   impose a range of sanctions;
                  c)   revoke the bank’s license; and
                  d)   cooperate and collaborate with relevant authorities to achieve an orderly resolution of
                       the bank, including triggering resolution where appropriate.

Description and   The BL provides the BRSA a broad range of tools that can be applied according to the
findings re EC6   severity of the situation. The definitions of situations when corrective actions can be taken
                  allow for timely supervisory action. Actions that could be taken include revoking the bank’s
                  license and triggering resolution. There are protocols that allow supervisors to coordinate
                  with resolution authorities.

                  Article 67 of the BL establishes that remedial action shall be taken against a bank when:

                  a)   Its assets are likely not to meet its obligations in terms of maturity or that the bank
                       does not comply with the provisions pertaining to liquidity,
                  b)   Its profitability is not at level that is sufficient to reliably perform its activities, due to
                       impaired balance and relations between revenues and expenses,
                  c)   Its own funds is inadequate pursuant to the provisions pertaining to capital adequacy, or
                       such case is likely to occur,
                  d)   The quality of its assets have deteriorated in such a manner that its financial structure
                       will weaken,
                  e)   Its decisions, transactions and practices are in violation of the BL and the applicable
                       regulations,
                  f)   It cannot establish its internal audit, internal control and risk management systems or
                       cannot operate these systems efficiently or there is a factor that impedes supervision, and
                  g)   Due to the incompetence of the management, the risks and the applicable legislation
                       have increased remarkably or have concentrated in such a manner that they may weaken
                       the financial standing.

                  If the BRSA identifies any of the situations described above, the agency may call on the
                  board of directors of relevant banks to increase the amount of the bank’s own funds or to
                  suspend the distribution of profits temporarily and transfer such to the reserves; or to
                  increase the provisions, or to stop extending loans to shareholders; or to ensure liquidity by
                  selling off assets; or to restrict or stop new investments; or to restrict payment of fees and
                  other types of payments; or to stop long-term investments. It can also call on eliminating
                  the violations, reviewing the loan policies and avoiding and stopping risky transactions, as
                  well as taking the necessary measures to mitigate the maturity, exchange rate or interest




                                                                                                                         21

         rate risks encountered. These measures or other measures deemed appropriate by the BRSA,
         needs to be implemented by banks within a time period set by the BRSA.

         When the bank fails to implement the determined corrective measures the agency may
         require the bank’s board of directors to take and promptly implement any measure,
         including the following:

         a)   to correct the financial structure, to raise one or both of the capital adequacy or
              liquidity levels, to sell off long-term or fixed assets, to restrict operational and
              management expenditures, to stop any payments to employees other than the regular
              payments and to restrict or prohibit the provision of cash or non-cash loans to certain
              persons, institutions, risk groups or sectors,
         b)   to eliminate violations; to call on the general assembly to convene extraordinarily to
              change one or several or all of the members of board of directors or to appoint new
              members or to remove from office the responsible employees; to prepare short,
              medium and long-term plans to be approved by the Board.

         The BRSA can also impose restrictive measures when banks fail to take the measures laid
         down above, or if the situation is judged severe enough by the Board. In those cases, the
         BRSA board shall require the bank to take and implement one or more of the following
         measures:

         a)   Restrict or temporarily suspend its activities, as inclusive of all the organization of the
              relevant activity, or the domestic or overseas branches to be deemed necessary or the
              relations with correspondent banks;
         b)   Impose any restriction or limitation pertaining to the collection and extension of funds,
              including interest rates and maturity limitations;
         c)   Dismiss some or all of the general manager, deputy general managers, relevant unit
              and branch directors including board of directors and obtain the approval of the
              Agency for persons to be appointed or selected in place of the persons removed from
              office;
         d)   Provide long-term loans to an extent that is not more than the amount of deposit or
              participation funds that is subject to insurance, with adequate guarantee to be
              provided from the shares of dominant partners and other assets;
         e)   Restrict or suspend the activities that are causing losses and liquidate the low-efficient
              and inefficient assets;
         f)   Merge with another willing bank or banks;
         g)   Find new shareholders to be deemed appropriate, in order to increase own funds; and
         h)   Deduct the arising loss from the own funds.

         Finally, according to Article 71 of the BL when the BRSA determines that the conditions for
         intervention are met in relation to a bank, it has two options: to revoke the bank’s operating
         permission (Article 106 of the BL) or to transfer the shareholder rights and its management
         and control to the SDIF (Article 107 of the BL). The conditions defined in the BL for
         intervention are the following:

                                                                                                           TURKEY



                  a)   The bank has not taken, either partially or completely, the requested restrictive
                       measures within the appropriate period or, even if having taken these measures, the
                       financial structure has not been strengthened or, it is considered that it cannot be
                       strengthened;
                  b)   The continuation of the bank’s activities will endanger the rights of the owners of
                       depositors and participation funds as well as the security and stability of the financial
                       system;
                  c)   The bank has not fulfilled its obligations as they fall due;
                  d)   The total value of the liabilities of the bank exceeds the total value of its assets; and
                  e)   The dominant partners or managers of the bank fraudulently use the resources of the
                       bank directly or indirectly in their own or others’ favor in such a manner that the sound
                       operation of the bank will be at stake, thus causing a loss for the bank;

                  There is regular exchange of information between the BRSA and the SDIF that enables the
                  SDIF to access supervisory information on individual banks. A Coordination Committee has
                  been established between the two institutions. This Committee meets at least once every
                  three months to further promote the exchange of information and high-level cooperation
                  between the two institutions. Furthermore, the BL determines that the BRSA and the SDIF
                  shall have access to jointly-agreed databases of each other within the principles of
                  confidentiality.

                  In addition, according to protocol signed between the BRSA and the SDIF, the BRSA notifies
                  the SDIF that a bank has been required to take corrective, rehabilitative, or restrictive
                  measures (Articles 68, 69, and 70). The timely notification allows SDIF to develop a
                  Resolution Action Plan. Please also refer to CP3.

                  Please also refer to CP11 for additional discussion on the use of these powers in practice.

EC7               The supervisor has the power to review the activities of parent companies and of companies
                  affiliated with parent companies to determine their impact on the safety and soundness of
                  the bank and the banking group.

Description and   The BL provides powers for the BRSA to supervise both banks and controlling parents of the
findings re EC7   bank. Supervision is performed on a consolidated and non-consolidated basis. Article 96 of
                  the BL includes among those obligated to provide information the shareholders of the
                  banks and banking groups therefore including parent companies.

Assessment of     Largely Compliant.
Principle 1

Comments          The BL provides a broadly appropriate framework for regulating and supervising banks. It
                  also provides clear responsibilities and adequate powers to the BRSA. However, the lack of
                  appropriately defined hierarchy among the objectives of financial stability and development
                  of the financial sector may cause potential conflicts and be harmful to the safety and
                  soundness of banks. The assessors noted that some BRSA decisions (e.g., differentiations in
                  loan loss provisions and loan restructuring rules) might be interpreted as rules that aim
                  primarily to support financial development objectives. Such measures might hinder the



                                                                                                                   23

                     reputation of the supervisors and convey the message of forbearance. In order to be fully
                     compliant with this principle the objective of development of the financial sector should be
                     explicitly subordinated to financial stability in the BL.

Principle 2          Independence, accountability, resourcing and legal protection for supervisors. The
                     supervisor possesses operational independence, transparent processes, sound governance,
                     budgetary processes that do not undermine autonomy and adequate resources, and is
                     accountable for the discharge of its duties and use of its resources. The legal framework for
                     banking supervision includes legal protection for the supervisor.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The operational independence, accountability and governance of the supervisor are
                     prescribed in legislation and publicly disclosed. There is no government or industry
                     interference that compromises the operational independence of the supervisor. The
                     supervisor has full discretion to take any supervisory actions or decisions on banks and
                     banking groups under its supervision.

Description and      Article 82 of the BL explicitly states that the BRSA:
findings re EC1
                     - has been established as a public legal person with administrative and financial autonomy;

                     - shall independently perform and use the regulatory and supervisory duties and rights
                     assigned thereto by the BL and the applicable legislation, under its own responsibility;

                     - shall independently use the financial resources allocated thereto within the framework of
                     the related laws, to the extent its duties and powers necessitate within the framework of the
                     principles and procedures set out in its own budget;

                     - shall employ adequate number of personnel with required qualifications in order to
                     efficiently fulfill its duties and powers.

                     However, the BL also establishes a few provisions that might undermine independence in
                     practice. Article 93 requires the BRSA to consult the related Ministry (Deputy Prime Minister),
                     before putting into force regulatory procedures other than internal regulations, in order to
                     check the harmony with the sector strategy and policies. Furthermore, the BL also allows the
                     relevant ministry to challenge BRSA’s regulatory decisions, allowing it to file a lawsuit for the
                     cancelation of the BRSA Boards’ regulatory decisions (art. 105). The BRSA has informed the
                     assessors that there is a draft amendment to the BL proposing the revocation of article 105.

                     On accountability and governance, the BRSA must brief the Council of Ministers
                     regarding its policies every six months. The Agency must also inform the Plans and Budget
                     Commission of the Turkish Grand National Assembly about its activities annually. The BL
                     (art. 97) also determines the BRSA to publish quarterly reports regarding the
                     developments in the financial sector as well as regular reports regarding the aggregated
                     performance of the financial institutions. Nevertheless, the assessors did not see evidence of
                     transparent scrutiny of the BRSA activities in relation to its goals and responsibilities, i.e., a
                     third part aiming to ensure that the powers delegated to the BRSA are exercised

                         appropriately and that its operations are effective and in line with its mandates and
                         objectives.

EC2                      The process for the appointment and removal of the head(s) of the supervisory authority
                         and members of its governing body is transparent. The head(s) of the supervisory authority
                         is (are) appointed for a minimum term and is removed from office during his/her term only
                         for reasons specified in law or if (s)he is not physically or mentally capable of carrying out
                         the role or has been found guilty of misconduct. The reason(s) for removal is publicly
                         disclosed.

Description and          The governing body of the BRSA is the board (BRSB) whose seven members including one
findings re EC2          Chairman, (also the Chairman of the BRSA), and one Deputy Chairman (co-Chairman) who
                         are appointed by the Council of Ministers.

                         The BL (Art. 84) establishes requirements for appointment of the members of the Board.
                         Board members should broadly meet the same conditions required for the founders of a
                         private bank and, additionally, cannot hold shares of the entities related to the sectors
                         which are under the regulatory and supervisory scope of the BRSA, engage in commerce,
                         carry out stock exchange transactions or to be directors or members of the board of
                         auditors of any company (Art. 86). Detailed obligations, prohibitions, incompatibilities, and
                         liabilities are established in the Regulation on Principles of Professional Conduct to be
                         Observed by the Members of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Board and by the
                         Staff of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, which binds the BRSB members
                         and the BRSA employees by rules on impartiality, conflicts of interest, confidentiality,
                         compatible activities outside the BRSA, acceptance of gifts as well as principles to be

                         The chairman and/or members of the BRSB are appointed for a 5 years term that can be
                         renewed once (BL, art. 85). The conditions for board members being removed from office
                         are established in the BL and cover issues such as medical conditions or not being able to
                         meet conditions for appointment. The removal depends upon approval of the Prime
                         Minister, but the law does not require the disclosure of the reasons.

Description and          According to Article 88 of the BL, the BRSB is responsible for determining the strategic plan,
findings re EC3          performance criteria, goals and objectives of the BRSA. The planning process comprises of
                         the determination of the goals, objectives and methods of the institution including the
                         human and financial resources. The resulting plan is published every three years.

                         The accountability arrangements are established in the BL. The BRSA must prepare and
                         submit an annual report of its activities to the Council of Ministers (art. 97). The report that
                         covers goals, organizational structure, regulatory and supervisory activities and agency
                         resources among other issues should be published in conjunction to its audit final accounts.

                  The BRSA is also required to inform the Plans and Budget Commission of the Turkish Grand
                  National Assembly about its activities once a year. As explained in EC1, the assessors did
                  not see evidences of independent and transparent scrutiny of the BRSA activities.

EC4               The supervisor has effective internal governance and communication processes that enable
                  supervisory decisions to be taken at a level appropriate to the significance of the issue and
                  timely decisions to be taken in the case of an emergency. The governing body is structured
                  to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest.

Description and   The BL establishes the BRSB as the decision-making organ of the BRSA. The Board main
findings re EC4   duties and powers are:

                  - take corrective, rehabilitating and restrictive measures against banks;

                  - revoke the operation permission of Banks;

                  - prepare the secondary legislation in harmony with the international standards and principles
                  regarding the sector or area which they are authorized to regulate and supervise and take
                  decisions to this effect;

                  - set the strategic plan, performance criteria, goals and objectives and service quality standards
                  of the Agency; to establish the human resources and working policies; to provide suggestions
                  regarding the Agency’s service units and their duties;

                  - debate and decide on the proposed budget of the Agency that is prepared in tune with the
                  Agency’s strategic plan and goals and objectives;

                  The chairman, who is the top rank manager of the Agency, is responsible for administering
                  and representing the Agency. The Chairman may assign some of his duties and powers,
                  which are not related to the Board, to his subordinates, provided that the boundaries of
                  such assignment are clearly put down in writing.

                  In practice, important decisions such as granting or revoking a bank’s license, significant
                  changes in a bank’s ownership structure and imposing severe measures to a bank are taken
                  by the BRSA Board. The level of the decisions to be taken is determined in the BL and in sub
                  regulations.

                  Operationally, all supervisory findings that might demand an action by the BRSA are sent to
                  the enforcement department which analyzes the available evidence and suggests an action
                  to the Board or other competent body.

                  Please refer to EC2 to information on conflict of interest.

EC5               The supervisor and its staff have credibility based on their professionalism and integrity.
                  There are rules on how to avoid conflicts of interest and on the appropriate use of
                  information obtained through work, with sanctions in place if these are not followed.

Description and   Board members and agency personnel are subject to regulation on Professional and Ethical
findings re EC5   Principles that aims to ensure professionalism and integrity. The principles provide, for
                  example, rules regarding impartiality, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, compatible

                  activities outside the BRSA, acceptance of gifts as well as principles to be observed while
                  leaving the BRSA.

                  Additionally, the BL states that the Board chairman and other personnel shall not disclose
                  confidential information regarding the Agency to any person even if they leave the office.
                  Also according to Article 92 professional staff cannot assume for at least two years any duty
                  in a bank where they conducted on-site and off- site supervision process or practice during
                  the past two years.

                  Banks expressed their respect for the professionalism and integrity of the BRSA staff.

EC6               The supervisor has adequate resources for the conduct of effective supervision and
                  oversight. It is financed in a manner that does not undermine its autonomy or operational
                  independence. This includes:

                  a)   a budget that provides for staff in sufficient numbers and with skills commensurate
                       with the risk profile and systemic importance of the banks and banking groups
                       supervised;
                  b)   salary scales that allow it to attract and retain qualified staff;
                  c)   the ability to commission external experts with the necessary professional skills and
                       independence, and subject to necessary confidentiality restrictions to conduct
                       supervisory tasks;
                  d)   a budget and program for the regular training of staff;
                  e)   a technology budget sufficient to equip its staff with the tools needed to supervise the
                       banking industry and assess individual banks and banking groups; and
                  f)   a travel budget that allows appropriate on-site work, effective cross-border
                       cooperation and participation in domestic and international meetings of significant
                       relevance (e.g., supervisory colleges).

Description and   The expenses of the BRSA are financed from contributions paid by the supervised
findings re EC6   institutions. The amount collected as contribution cannot exceed three per ten thousand of
                  the total assets of the institutions. Excess revenues of the Agency at the end of the financial
                  year are transferred to the general budget. The ratio, decided by the BRSA board, is
                  substantially below the limit, given the agency room for maneuvering.

                  The BRSA staff on supervisory functions number grew from approximately 220 in 2013 to
                  265 in 2015 mainly due to the creation of the Department of Information Systems
                  Compliance and the Department of Data and System management. Also refer to CP 9.

                  BRSA personnel can be hired under contract or permanent position. Senior management,
                  including Vice chairmen, department heads, directors, chairman’s advisors and the
                  professional staff are employed under contracts signed for their positions. This arrangement
                  exempts their remuneration from following the Civil Servants Law.

                  Board Chairman shall be paid a monthly salary that is equal to the amount of financial and
                  social rights paid to the Prime Ministry Undersecretary. The remuneration of Board members
                  is equal to ninety-five percent of the Board Chairman. The salaries and other social and




                                                                                                                27
TURKEY



                  financial rights of the permanent contracted personnel of the Agency are determined by the
                  Board, on the condition that they will not be more than the maximum amount indicated to the
                  chairman.

                  BRSA non contractual personnel follow the public sector salary scales. The salary level tends
                  to be lower than the private sector especially for the middle and upper management levels.
                  The average compensation at the entry level is higher than the private sector.

                  The BRSB is empowered to hire new employees observed the limits fixed by the BL. The BL
                  limits are reasonably higher than the current staff, allowing room for additional staff if the
                  Agency consider necessary. Entry conditions are not attractive for mid-career professionals
                  that provides practical constraints to the hiring of experienced staff. In practice new hires
                  are mostly recently graduate professionals that are trained in the agency. The absence of an
                  effective option to recruit mid-career staff might represent a challenge particularly if the
                  agency loses a substantial number of experienced staff.

                  The BRSA has a budget and a program for regular training of the staff. Records show a
                  comprehensive number of trainings activities in terms of topics and number of participants
                  that were developed domestically and abroad.

                  Technology expenditures are made to keep the staff equipped with the tools needed to
                  supervise the banking industry. BRSA has memberships at online learning environments,
                  market data providers (Reuters, Bloomberg and etc.) and buys specialized hardware and
                  software (about reporting systems, risk measurement tools etc.) to supervise the industry.

                  The BRSA explained that the travel budget is adequate for their supervisory work and
                  cooperation initiatives with other supervisors. As an example, it mentioned that BRSA staff
                  represents BRSA in a number of committees and subgroups of the Financial Stability Board
                  and the Basel Committee. The BRSA also claimed that adequate resources are allocated for
                  the participation in supervisory colleges and on-site supervision of subsidiaries abroad.

Description and   BRSA board is responsible for defining the strategic plan for the agency. The plan sets three

                  Training needs to bridge gaps are assessed annually during the development of the BRSA
                  Annual Training Plan. The process collects training needs from the different departments
                  and proposes events to address them. The plan is discussed with the Human Resources
                  Committee and the Chairman.

                  When additional human resources are considered necessary, head of departments make a
                  request to the Human Resources Committee. After an evaluation, the final decision for
                  hiring new personnel is made by the chairmanship.

EC8               In determining supervisory programs and allocating resources, supervisors take into
                  account the risk profile and systemic importance of individual banks and banking groups,
                  and the different mitigation approaches available.

Description and   The BRSA determines its supervisory plan with a dynamic risk focus approach. Resources are
findings re EC8   allocated mainly based on the sector share of bank’s total risk (Credit, Market and
                  Operational) and the bank’s rating determined by the supervisory team. A larger amount of
                  resources are allocate to more risky and systemic important banks. See detailed discussion
                  in CP8.

                  The supervisory plan is continuously revised, which may change the allocation of resources
                  during the year. These are discussed constantly between the frontline analyst teams and the
                  BRSA’s senior management.

EC9               Laws provide protection to the supervisor and its staff against lawsuits for actions taken
                  and/or omissions made while discharging their duties in good faith. The supervisor and its
                  staff are adequately protected against the costs of defending their actions and/or omissions
                  made while discharging their duties in good faith.

Description and   The BL provides legal protection for the supervisors. Article 104 estates that lawsuits against
findings re EC9   the Chairman, Board members and staff for actions taken in good faith in the exercise of
                  their responsibilities are subject to the permission of relevant Minister for the Chairman and
                  Board members and the permission of the Chairman for the Agency staff.

                  The law also establishes that for the initiation of any investigation of offenses alleged to
                  have been committed by the chairman, Board members and Agency personnel in
                  connection with their duties there must be a clear and solid evidence indicating that such
                  members or personnel have acted for acquiring interests for themselves or third persons
                  and for causing damages on the Agency or third persons and have acquired interests for
                  themselves or third persons and caused damages as a result of their acts.

                  The law also establishes a framework to protect staff from the costs of litigation connected
                  to their duties in the BRSA even if they have left office. The legal fees for such lawsuits as
                  well as the attorney’s fees are financed from the budget of the Agency.

                  Finally, the law provides protection against legal action for compensation of damages,
                  payment of receivables and executive proceedings. As long as the action is connected with
                  the duties of the Agency, both during and after the staff terms in office, the legal action
                  should be considered to have been taken against the Agency. There were no civil law cases
                  against officers and managers of the BRSA within the scope of this provision in the last five
                  years.

Assessment of     Materially Non-compliant
Principle 2

Comments          The legal protection of the supervisor is broadly adequate. Nonetheless the institutional
                  framework contains shortcomings that should be improved.




                                                                                                                 29

                     The BL establishes the BRSA as an independent body but it contains provisions that might
                     undermine independence in practice. There are several channels of interaction between the
                     BRSA and the government that, considered together, may accommodate political influence:
                     i) the appointments of the Chair and Board members are made by the Council of Ministers
                     without any confirmation process by other independent body; ii) before putting into force
                     regulatory procedures the BRSA needs, by law, to consult the related Ministry; iii) the Prime
                     Minister can approve the removal, if the conditions specified in the BL are met, of members
                     of the Board without publishing the reasons; iv) the relevant minister may permit lawsuit
                     against board members; and v) the BL allows the relevant ministry to file a lawsuit for the
                     cancelation of the Boards regulatory decisions (art. 105). These possible channels of political
                     influence over the Agency, particularly considering the large role played by state owned banks in
                     Turkey, might cause conflicts of interests that might undermine financial stability.

                     The authorities should therefore review the legislation to limit the cases that require the
                     Minister’s involvement. In particular, it seems appropriate to establish a third party to
                     perform a stronger role in the checks and balances framework such as, making regulatory
                     consultation procedures more transparent, so that BRSA proposals and Ministry comments
                     are published, introducing a process for appointments for the BRSB to be confirmed by a
                     nonexecutive government body and removing the related minister permission for lawsuits
                     for the cancelation of the BRSB regulatory decisions.

                     There also seems to be room for improving the accountability framework. Despite the
                     periodic briefings from the BRSA to the Council of Ministers, the assessors could not see
                     evidence of a third part aiming to ensure that the powers delegated to the BRSA are
                     exercised appropriately and that its operations are effective and in line with its mandate and
                     objectives.

                     Finally, in relation to resourcing, entry conditions to the BRSA are not attractive for the
                     hiring of mid-career professionals and provide practical constraints in the event of a
                     shortfall in experience levels.

Principle 3          Cooperation and collaboration. Laws, regulations or other arrangements provide a
                     framework for cooperation and collaboration with relevant domestic authorities and foreign
                     supervisors. These arrangements reflect the need to protect confidential information. 9

Essential criteria

EC1                  Arrangements, formal or informal, are in place for cooperation, including analysis and
                     sharing of information, and undertaking collaborative work, with all domestic authorities
                     with responsibility for the safety and soundness of banks, other financial institutions and/or
                     the stability of the financial system. There is evidence that these arrangements work in

                  institutions for timely and consistent responses. The SRAG members are the FSC member
                  institutions’ deputies, with the BRSA acting as the secretariat. The SRAG meets at least four
                  times a year, and the minutes and outcomes of the meetings are reported to the FSC.

                  The Financial Sector Commission (FSEC), consisting of the representatives of BRSA, Ministry
                  of Finance, the Treasury, CBRT, CMB, SDIF, Competition Board, SPO, Istanbul Gold
                  Exchange, securities stock exchanges, Futures and Options Markets and the associations of
                  institutions is responsible for establishing and ensuring confidence, stability and the
                  development of the financial markets. This Commission is meant to ensure exchange of
                  information, cooperation and coordination among institutions and propose joint policies. It
                  meets once every six months and shall brief the Council of Ministers regarding the results of
                  its meetings.

                  The article 98 of the BL, also determines the BRSA, Treasury Undersecretary, State Planning
                  Organization Undersecretary, the SDIF and CBRT to exchange views regarding the
                  implementation of monetary, credit and banking policies. Article 98 also contains provisions
                  allowing the BRSA, SDIF and the CBRT to have access to the jointly-agreed databases of
                  each other.

                  The Coordination Committee (CC) composed by the BRSA and the SDIF aims to ensure
                  cooperation in bank resolution. The committee meets quarterly to exchange views about
                  the banking sector and other common issues.

                  Particularly relevant for the supervision of conglomerates are protocols signed for
                  information sharing between BRSA and other local authorities. These authorities includes
                  the Treasury, CMB, SDIF, CBRT, General Directorate of Criminal Registration and Statistics,
                  MASAK, Republic of Turkey Social Security Institution; TÜRKSAT A.Ş., Central Registration
                  Institution and Turkish Competition Authority.

                  There is evidence that these arrangements have been operating and discussing relevant
                  issues. Bilateral protocols like the one signed by the BRSA and the Treasury seem particular
                  relevant for exchange of information such as summaries of inspection reports between
                  supervisors while committees such as the FSC and FSEC focus on more broad issues.

EC2               Arrangements, formal or informal, are in place for cooperation, including analysis and
                  sharing of information, and undertaking collaborative work, with relevant foreign

                  supervisors of banks and banking groups. There is evidence that these arrangements work
                  in practice, where necessary.

Description and   The legal basis for formal cooperation and information sharing by the BRSA with other
findings re EC2   foreign supervisory authorities is found in Article 98 of the BL.

                  The BRSA has signed MoUs with supervisory authorities of 34 countries. According to these
                  agreements supervisors commit themselves to use their best endeavors to cooperate in
                  routine supervisions and to notify and provide each other relevant information in a prompt
                  and timely manner regarding any material supervisory concerns. Discussions on MoUs are
                  underway with authorities of 5 additional countries.

                  Article 98 of the BL authorizes the BRSA to cooperate with foreign supervisory authorities
                  even in the absence of an MoU. In this case, eventual requests from foreign authorities are
                  subject to BRSB’s approval considering the principle of reciprocity.

                  The BRSA conducts on-site inspections in foreign jurisdictions in which Turkish banks and
                  their subsidiaries operate and foreign supervisors conduct inspections in Turkey on the
                  basis of reciprocity. When BRSA supervisors conduct on-site examination of banks in a
                  foreign jurisdiction, findings are always shared with foreign supervisory authorities through
                  official correspondence or meetings.

                  Turkish supervisors also participate in supervisory colleges in foreign jurisdictions upon
                  invitation. The BRSA, as a host supervisor authority, is an observer in some supervisory
                  colleges of the global banks which also operate in Turkey.

                  There is evidence of collaborative work. Refer to CP 13 for additional discussion.

EC3               The supervisor may provide confidential information to another domestic authority or
                  foreign supervisor but must take reasonable steps to determine that any confidential
                  information so released will be used only for bank-specific or system-wide supervisory
                  purposes and will be treated as confidential by the receiving party.

Description and   The framework for the protection of confidential information is established in the article 73
findings re EC3   of the BL that lays down the restrictions not only for domestic authorities but also foreign
                  supervisors. In essence all data obtained by the BRSA by virtue of its supervisory activity are
                  covered by professional secrecy.

                  Nevertheless, the BL establishes several working arrangements that allow the exchange of
                  information with other domestic and foreign authorities as long as the principle of
                  confidentiality is appropriately maintained (see EC1 and EC2 above). The BRSA requires
                  other supervisors to commit themselves to protect the information, including signing
                  memorandums of understanding with specific confidentiality clauses. According to the BL,
                  the agency does not share confidential information if it has any reason to believe that the
                  counterparties will not maintain the confidentiality. The BL also forbids the BRSA to share
                  confidential information with anyone who is not authorized by the BL or may use the
                  information for own benefit

EC4               The supervisor receiving confidential information from other supervisors uses the
                  confidential information for bank-specific or system-wide supervisory purposes only. The
                  supervisor does not disclose confidential information received to third parties without the
                  permission of the supervisor providing the information and is able to deny any demand
                  (other than a court order or mandate from a legislative body) for confidential information in
                  its possession. In the event that the supervisor is legally compelled to disclose confidential
                  information it has received from another supervisor, the supervisor promptly notifies the
                  originating supervisor, indicating what information it is compelled to release and the
                  circumstances surrounding the release. Where consent to passing on confidential
                  information is not given, the supervisor uses all reasonable means to resist such a demand
                  or protect the confidentiality of the information.

Description and   According to the article 73 of the BL, the BRSB is responsible for keeping the confidentiality
findings re EC4   of information and documents obtained within or outside the scope of MoUs. Confidential
                  information and documents obtained by the Agency may be used for the purposes of
                  licensing, supervision, monitoring compliance with legislation and for administrative
                  lawsuits filed against the decisions of the Board. The confidential information and
                  documents obtained by the BRSA cannot be disclosed to any person or entity, other than
                  the public prosecutors and criminal courts if and when needed in the course of criminal
                  proceedings and prosecutions.

                  Additionally, protocols on information exchange that the BRSA has signed with other
                  domestic authorities contain provisions establishing the confidentiality clauses of the BL. As
                  explained in EC3, all data obtained by the BRSA by virtue of its supervisory activity are
                  covered by professional secrecy.

                  MoUs with foreign authorities contain clauses stating that the provided information is
                  subject to confidentiality and should be used only for supervisory purposes. These clauses
                  also establish that when the supervisor is legally compelled to disclose confidential
                  information it has received from another supervisor, the supervisor promptly notifies the
                  originating supervisor.

EC5               Processes are in place for the supervisor to support resolution authorities (e.g., central
                  banks and finance ministries as appropriate) to undertake recovery and resolution planning
                  and actions.

Description and   The Turkish resolution authority for credit institutions, including the branches and
findings re EC5   subsidiaries of foreign banks established in Turkey, participation banks (“Islamic banks”) and
                  financial holding companies is the SDIF. The role of the BRSA in the resolution process is to
                  initiate the resolution and decide on the transfer of a failed bank to the SDIF either by
                  revoking its operating license or by transferring its management and control as defined in
                  the article 71 of the BL. As described in EC1, the CC created by the BL ensures coordination
                  between the two authorities on bank resolution.

                  Following the notification of the BRSA that a bank is asked to take corrective, rehabilitative,
                  or restrictive measures the SDIF develops a bank-specific Resolution Action Plan. The

TURKEY



                     Resolution Action Plan includes alternative bank-specific resolution plans, a verification
                     process for determining the amount of insured deposits to be covered and plans for the
                     rapid deployment of the personnel for the purpose of safeguarding the information
                     technology (IT) systems and data of the bank.

                     However, there is no framework for ex ante recovery and resolution planning in Turkey. The
                     BRSA and the SDIF have formed a joint working group that is currently in the process of
                     developing policy proposals and necessary amendments to the legislation.

Principle 3

Comments             Legal provisions as well as operational frameworks for cooperation and collaboration with
                     domestic and foreign authorities are in place. Protections on confidentiality appear
                     appropriate. Regarding the lack of processes for recovery and resolution planning, the
                     assessors do not see their absence as reflecting a lack of collaboration between authorities.
                     See also CP9.

Principle 4          Permissible activities. The permissible activities of institutions that are licensed and subject
                     to supervision as banks are clearly defined and the use of the word “bank” in names is
                     controlled.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The term “bank” is clearly defined in laws or regulations.

Description and      The term “bank” is defined in the BL Article 3 as deposit banks, participation banks and
findings re EC1      development and investment banks.

                     Deposit banks are defined as the institutions operating primarily for the purpose of
                     accepting deposit and granting loan in their own names and for their own accounts.
                     Participation banks are those operating primarily for the purposes of collecting fund through
                     special current accounts and participation accounts and granting loan. Finally, development
                     and investment banks are those operating primarily for the purposes of granting loan or to
                     fulfill the duties assigned by their special laws, other than accepting deposit or participation
                     funds.

EC2                  The permissible activities of institutions that are licensed and subject to supervision as
                     banks are clearly defined either by supervisors, or in laws or regulations.

Description and      The BL defines the activities that banks are permitted to perform and prohibited to carry
findings re EC2      out.

                     According to article 4, banks may perform a broad range of activities including accepting
                     deposits or participation funds, granting loans, either cash or non-cash, carrying out any
                     type of payment and collection transactions, including cash and deposit payment and fund
                     transfer transactions, correspondent bank transactions, or use of check accounts,
                     purchasing transactions of commercial bills, safe-keeping services, issuing payment

                    money market instruments, trading of precious metals and stones, trading and
                    intermediation of forward, future and option contracts, purchase and sale of capital market
                    instruments and repurchasing or re-sale commitments, intermediation for issuance or
                    public offering of capital market instruments, transactions for trading previously issued
                    capital market instruments for intermediation purposes, guarantee transactions like
                    undertaking guarantees and other liabilities in favor of other persons, investment
                    counseling services, portfolio operation and management, primary market dealing for
                    purchase-sales transactions, factoring, financial leasing services, insurance agency and
                    individual private pension fund services.

                    The BL also allows banks to perform “other activities to be determined by the Board”. The
                    BRSA has explained that these activities are mostly on advisory services and operational
                    support, particularly for subsidiaries. Banks’ requests to perform other activities are
                    analyzed according to the supervisory opinion on the specific case and principles settled by
                    the BRSB.

EC3                 The use of the word “bank” and any derivations such as “banking” in a name, including
                    domain names, is limited to licensed and supervised institutions in all circumstances where
                    the general public might otherwise be misled.

Description and     According to the article 150 of the BL legal persons who do not have a license are
findings re EC3     prohibited to use the business title of a bank in notices, advertisements and public
                    statements. It is also prohibited to use other words and expressions which could create the
                    impression that they were accepting deposits or participation funds or acting as a bank.
                    Penalties for the breach of these rules are imprisonment and judicial fines for real persons
                    and close of the business places where the offense is committed.

EC4                 The taking of deposits from the public is reserved for institutions that are licensed and
                    subject to supervision as banks. 10

Description and     Art. 60 of the BL establishes that only credit institutions, that are supervised by BRSA are
findings re EC4     permitted to accept deposits or participation funds. Accepting deposits without permission
                    of the BRSA is legally punishable.

EC5                 The supervisor or licensing authority publishes or otherwise makes available a current list of
                    licensed banks, including branches of foreign banks, operating within its jurisdiction in a
                    way that is easily accessible to the public.

Description and     The list of licensed banks and branches is published and updated regularly on the BRSA’s
findings re EC5     website. According to the Article 10 of the BL, the permissions granted shall be published in
                    the Official Gazette.




10The Committee recognizes the presence in some countries of non-banking financial institutions that take deposits
but may be regulated differently from banks. These institutions should be subject to a form of regulation
commensurate to the type and size of their business and, collectively, should not hold a significant proportion of
deposits in the financial system.

Principle 4

Comments             The BL provides clear definitions of activities that are only permitted to be conducted by
                     registered banks, including taking deposits from the public.

Principle 5          Licensing criteria. The licensing authority has the power to set criteria and reject
                     applications for establishments that do not meet the criteria. At a minimum, the licensing
                     process consists of an assessment of the ownership structure and governance (including the
                     fitness and propriety of Board members and senior management) 11 of the bank and its
                     wider group, and its strategic and operating plan, internal controls, risk management and
                     projected financial condition (including capital base). Where the proposed owner or parent
                     organization is a foreign bank, the prior consent of its home supervisor is obtained.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The law identifies the authority responsible for granting and withdrawing a banking license.
                     The licensing authority could be the banking supervisor or another competent authority. If
                     the licensing authority and the supervisor are not the same, the supervisor has the right to
                     have its views on each application considered, and its concerns addressed. In addition, the
                     licensing authority provides the supervisor with any information that may be material to the
                     supervision of the licensed bank. The supervisor imposes prudential conditions or
                     limitations on the newly licensed bank, where appropriate.

Description and      The BL identifies the BRSA as both the licensing and supervisory authority in Turkey.
findings re EC1      According to article 6 of the BL, the establishment of a bank in Turkey or the opening up of
                     the first branch in Turkey by a bank established abroad needs to be approved by the BRSB.

                     The licensing of banks in Turkey is a two-step process that includes on-site supervisors and
                     several prudential conditions that needs to be fulfilled by banks. The whole process is
                     conducted by the BRSA. See a description in EC2.

                     During the last five years four banks were granted a license to operate in Turkey.

EC2                  Laws or regulations give the licensing authority the power to set criteria for licensing banks.
                     If the criteria are not fulfilled or if the information provided is inadequate, the licensing
                     authority has the power to reject an application. If the licensing authority or supervisor
                     determines that the license was based on false information, the license can be revoked.




11 This document refers to a governance structure composed of a board and senior management. The Committee

recognizes that there are significant differences in the legislative and regulatory frameworks across countries
regarding these functions. Some countries use a two-tier board structure, where the supervisory function of the
board is performed by a separate entity known as a supervisory board, which has no executive functions. Other
countries, in contrast, use a one-tier board structure in which the board has a broader role. Owing to these
differences, this document does not advocate a specific board structure. Consequently, in this document, the terms
“board” and “senior management” are only used as a way to refer to the oversight function and the management
function in general and should be interpreted throughout the document in accordance with the applicable law within
each jurisdiction.

                       internal audit system.

                  Additionally, any bank established abroad should meet the following conditions to be
                  allowed to operate a branch in Turkey:

                  a)   Its primary activities must not have been prohibited in the country where they are
                       headquartered,
                  b)   The supervisory authority in the country, wherein the headquarters of the bank is located

                  f)   The banking group must have a transparent partnership structure.

                  The BRSA assess these conditions through documents provided by the applicants. The
                  necessary documentation is listed in Regulation on Transactions Subject to Permission and
                  Indirect Shareholding (RTSPIO), Article 4.

                  In addition to the establishment permission, banks need to request the BRSA permission for
                  operation. The banks that have an establishment permission are required to meet additional
                  criteria including:

                  a)   Their capital should have been paid in cash and must be at a level that enables the
                       execution of the planned activities,




                                                                                                                   37

                       b)   At least one fourth of the system entrance fee, equivalent to ten percent of the
                            minimum capital requirements, should have been paid to the account of the deposit
                            insurance fund (SDIF),
                       c)   Their activities should be in compliance with corporate governance provisions and have
                            the required personnel and technical infrastructure,
                       d)   Their managers should bear the qualifications set out in the corporate governance
                            provisions, and
                       e)   The Board should comment that they bear the qualifications required for executing the
                            activities.

                       The article 10 of RTSPIO provides additional information about the assessment process for
                       granting operating license. The conditions are assessed in on-site examinations. BRSA examines
                       among other issues whether the capital of the bank has been paid in cash in an arm‘s
                       length basis, whether it has technical equipment, hardware and adequate staff capable of
                       performing such operations, whether its staff in managerial positions meet fit and proper
                       criteria and whether necessary arrangements have been made to ensure compliance of its
                       operations with the principles of corporate management.

                       The establishment permission of a bank can be revoked by a Board decision in case of one
                       or more of the following conditions (BL, art. 11):

                       a)   The permission is based on non-factual declarations,
                       b)   Failure to apply for operating permission within nine months following the
                            issue of the establishment permission,
                       c)   Clearly stating the decision to waive the establishment permission,
                       d)   Losing the eligibility qualifications for permission until commencement of operation,
                       e)   Failure to obtain the operating permission,
                       f)   Voluntary waiver from the whole activities allowed for banks,
                       g)   Completion of bank merger and acquisition transactions, and
                       h)   Completion of liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings under Article 106 of this Law.

                       The BRSB can also revoke the operating permissions of banks in case the Agency
                       determines, as a result of supervision, that appropriate conditions have not been fulfilled
                       (see CP1, EC 6 for discussion).

                       During the last five years one licensed was surrender. None have been revoked.

EC3                    The criteria for issuing licenses are consistent with those applied in ongoing supervision.

Description and        As described in EC 2, the BL provides criteria for authorization and registration that are
findings re EC3        consistent with those applied for ongoing supervision.

EC4                    The licensing authority determines that the proposed legal, managerial, operational and
                       ownership structures of the bank and its wider group will not hinder effective supervision
                       on both a solo and a consolidated basis. 12 The licensing authority also determines, where

                  appropriate, that these structures will not hinder effective implementation of corrective
                  measures in the future.

Description and   Among the criteria imposed by the BL for the establishment of banks it is set out that the
findings re EC4   ownership structure required does not hamper effective supervision on both a solo and a
                  consolidated level. There are also criteria for clear ownership structures that do not hinder
                  the implementation of corrective measures (see EC2 above for details).

EC5               The licensing authority identifies and determines the suitability of the bank’s major
                  shareholders, including the ultimate beneficial owners, and others that may exert significant
                  influence. It also assesses the transparency of the ownership structure, the sources of initial
                  capital and the ability of shareholders to provide additional financial support, where
                  needed.

Description and   The BL (article 8) establishes criteria for bank’s founders and natural person shareholder of
findings re EC5   the legal person founder with qualified shares of banks. These criteria include:

                  a)   not have been declared bankrupt;
                  b)   not have qualified shares or not hold control in banks that have been subjected to
                       restrictive measures;
                  c)   not have qualified shares or not hold control in banks subjected to liquidation, in
                       development and investment banks whose operating permissions have been revoked,
                       or in credit institutions whose shareholder rights have been transferred to the SDIF;
                  d)   have not been sentenced to heavy imprisonment;
                  e)   have necessary financial strength and reputation; and
                  f)   have the honesty and competence required for the business.

                  The BL also demands that, in case of legal person and banks established abroad,
                  partnership structure should be open and transparent.

                  In order to assess the above mention criteria, the BRSA (RTSPIO Art. 4) demands a series of
                  documents such as tables showing the shareholding structure of legal entity founders until
                  their natural partners, lists showing shareholder eventual privileged shares, legal documents
                  stating that qualified shareholders have not been declared bankruptcy, criminal records of
                  qualified shareholders, reports on the financial status of qualified shareholders and
                  commitments to declare the source of capital.

                  The enforcement department of the BRSA analyses all the documents following internal
                  manuals that list topics that should be considered, including when assessing financial
                  strength of the shareholders.

                  In terms of initial capital, according to Article 7of RTSPIO, the Agency examines whether the
                  capital of the bank applying for operating permission has been paid in cash in a manner
                  free of any fictitious transactions and whether it is in an appropriate level. The initial capital
                  of the bank that is transferred to the bank accounts is checked by on-site supervisors that
                  also assess whether the amount of capital is sufficient to fulfill the planned activities.

EC6               A minimum initial capital amount is stipulated for all banks.



                                                                                                                 39

Description and          BRSA has stipulated a minimum capital amount of 300 million USD for all banks (see EC2
findings re EC6          above).

EC7                      The licensing authority, at authorization, evaluates the bank’s proposed Board members
                         and senior management as to expertise and integrity (fit and proper test), and any potential
                         for conflicts of interest. The fit and proper criteria include: (i) skills and experience in
                         relevant financial operations commensurate with the intended activities of the bank; and
                         (ii) no record of criminal activities or adverse regulatory judgments that make a person unfit
                         to uphold important positions in a bank. 13 The licensing authority determines whether the
                         bank’s Board has collective sound knowledge of the material activities the bank intends to
                         pursue, and the associated risks.

Description and          As described in EC2 the conditions for the establishment of banks in Turkey includes fit and
findings re EC7          proper criteria for board members. The BL establishes that the majority of the board of
                         directors should meet the qualifications for general manager that includes: not have been
                         declared bankrupt, have not been sentenced to heavy imprisonment or convicted of serious
                         crimes, have at least undergraduate degrees in suitable disciplines and have at least ten
                         years of professional experience in the field of banking or business administration.

                         The Deputy general managers must have at least seven years of professional experience
                         and at least two thirds of them must have at least undergraduate degree in suitable
                         disciplines. Even if employed with different position titles, other executives whose authority
                         and duties are comparable to a deputy general manager or who occupy higher executive
                         positions are subject to the provisions pertaining to deputy general managers.

                         The suitability criterion is evaluated through documents attesting the educational and
                         professional background. The documentation that should be provided to the BRSA is
                         specified in regulation (RSMOD). Apart from educational and professional background, the
                         BRSA also checks if there is no record of criminal activities or adverse regulatory judgments
                         that make a person unfit to uphold managerial positions in a bank.

                         The BRSA does not impose requirements and does not assess if the board of the bank has a
                         collective sound knowledge of the material activities the bank intends to pursue.

EC8                      The licensing authority reviews the proposed strategic and operating plans of the bank. This
                         includes determining that an appropriate system of corporate governance, risk
                         management and internal controls, including those related to the detection and prevention
                         of criminal activities, as well as the oversight of proposed outsourced functions, will be in
                         place. The operational structure is required to reflect the scope and degree of sophistication
                         of the proposed activities of the bank. 14

Description and          As noted in EC2, the criteria for the establishment of banks in Turkey include the harmony
findings re EC8          of the envisaged activities with planned financial, managerial and organizational structure.

                   The BL also demands the applicant bank to submit to the BRSA the work plans for the
                   envisioned fields of activity, the projections regarding the financial structure of the
                   institution including capital adequacy, the budgetary plan for the first three years and an
                   activity program including internal control, risk management and internal audit system.

                   The RTSPIO demands applicants to send “an operational program, which analyzes benefits
                   expected from establishment of the bank, indicates operations to be carried out and
                   operational plans containing methods of achieving internal supervision, internal control and
                   risk management and incorporates the financial structure of the organization in a manner
                   also containing the capital adequacy of the relevant projections, thereof.“

                   The projections and operational program of the proposed bank is assessed and reviewed
                   with comparison to existing banks in Turkish banking sector that engages in similar
                   activities and have a similar structure. Internal manuals guide the process listing issues that
                   should be considered by supervisors. Compliance with corporate governance regulations,
                   including risk management and internal control systems and IT systems are assessed in on-
                   site supervision before the operating permission is granted.

EC9                The licensing authority reviews pro forma financial statements and projections of the
                   proposed bank. This includes an assessment of the adequacy of the financial strength to
                   support the proposed strategic plan as well as financial information on the principal
                   shareholders of the bank.

Description and    The BL demands the founders of banks to have the necessary financial strength and
findings re EC9    reputation. These criteria and financial projections of the proposed bank are assessed by
                   the BRSA during the licensing process (please also refer to EC 2 for details).

EC10               In the case of foreign banks establishing a branch or subsidiary, before issuing a license, the
                   host supervisor establishes that no objection (or a statement of no objection) from the
                   home supervisor has been received. For cross-border banking operations in its country, the
                   host supervisor determines whether the home supervisor practices global consolidated
                   supervision.

Description and    The criteria for the establishment of foreign banks in Turkey includes that the bank primary
findings re EC10   activities must not have been prohibited in the country where they are headquartered and
                   that the home supervisor do not have negative views regarding its operation in Turkey. In
                   order to assess these requirements, the BRSA requires a “no objection letter” from the
                   home supervisor (RTSPIO). Nevertheless, there is no determination that the home
                   supervisor practices global consolidated supervision.

EC11               The licensing authority or supervisor has policies and processes to monitor the progress of
                   new entrants in meeting their business and strategic goals, and to determine that
                   supervisory requirements outlined in the license approval are being met.

Description and    During the license approval process, banks are instructed on issues that need improvements
findings re EC11   and eventual recommendations to correct deficiencies are shared with on-site supervisors
                   who are responsible for following them up. As explained in EC2, licensing is a two-step




                                                                                                                41

                     process. The period between the establishment permission and the operation permission is
                     a monitoring phase with a special focus on governance and operational requirements.

                     Once the bank starts operating, supervision procedures follow the ones applicable to all
                     banks. These procedures include assessing the actual performance of banks in relation to
                     their business plans.

Assessment of        Largely Compliant
Principle 5

Comments             Provisions in the laws and regulations related to licensing and the process followed by the
                     BRSA provide a comprehensive framework to assess the adequacy of new registrations for
                     banks, including foreign bank branches. The BRSA seems to have a broadly sound process
                     to assess applications in practice. However, in order to maintain a licensing process fully
                     compliant with the principle, the BRSA needs to additionally: i) impose requirements and
                     assess if the bank’s board has a collectively sound knowledge of the material activities the
                     bank intends to pursue; and ii) for cross-border banking operations, determine whether the
                     home supervisor practices global consolidated supervision.

Principle 6          Transfer of significant ownership. The supervisor 15 has the power to review, reject and
                     impose prudential conditions on any proposals to transfer significant ownership or
                     controlling interests held directly or indirectly in existing banks to other parties.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws or regulations contain clear definitions of “significant ownership” and “controlling
                     interest”.

Description and      According to the Article 3 of the BL, “control” is defined as “the power to appoint or remove
findings re EC1      from office the decision-taking majority of members of board of directors through direct or
                     indirect possession of the majority of a legal entity’s capital irrespective of the requirement
                     of owning minimum 51 % of its capital; or by having control over the majority of the voting
                     right as a consequence of holding privileged shares or of agreements with other
                     shareholders although not owning the majority of capital”.

                     The concept of “Significant ownership” is referred in the BL as “qualified shares” and is
                     defined as “the shares that represent, directly or indirectly, 10 % or more of the capital or
                     voting rights of an undertaking or that yield the privilege to appoint members to board of
                     directors even though such rate is below 10 %”. The BL also define “dominant partner” as
                     “natural or legal entities that directly or indirectly, individually or jointly control an
                     undertaking”.

EC2                  There are requirements to obtain supervisory approval or provide immediate notification of
                     proposed changes that would result in a change in ownership, including beneficial

issues might be addressed by a separate licensing authority.

                  ownership, or the exercise of voting rights over a particular threshold or change in
                  controlling interest.

Description and   The BL establish requirements for approval of changes in ownership. Article 18 of the BL
findings re EC2   requires the permission of the BRSA for:

                  a)   Any acquisition of shares that result in the acquisition by one person directly or
                       indirectly of shares representing 10 % or more of the capital of a bank or if shares held
                       directly or indirectly by one shareholder exceed 10 %, 20 %, 33 % or 50 % percent of
                       the capital as a result thereof, and assignments of shares that result in shares held by
                       one shareholder falling below these percentages.
                  b)   Assignment and transfer of preferential shares with the right of promoting a member
                       to the board of directors or audit committee or issue of new shares irrespective of
                       limits.
                  c)   The transfer of shares of legal entities directly or indirectly, who own 10 % or more of
                       the capital of a bank, under terms and conditions of a).

                  Article 18 of the BL also establishes that the permission might be given on the condition
                  that the person who acquires the shares bears the qualifications required for the founders
                  (see CP5). In cases where the shares are transferred without the permission of the BRSB, the
                  shareholder rights of the legal entity stemming from these shares, other than dividends,
                  shall be exercised by the SDIF.

                  The documents that are required to be submitted for transfer of ownership are listed in
                  Article 11 of Regulation on Transactions Subject to Permission and Indirect Shareholding
                  (RTSPIO).

EC3               The supervisor has the power to reject any proposal for a change in significant ownership,
                  including beneficial ownership, or controlling interest, or prevent the exercise of voting
                  rights in respect of such investments to ensure that any change in significant ownership
                  meets criteria comparable to those used for licensing banks. If the supervisor determines
                  that the change in significant ownership was based on false information, the supervisor has
                  the power to reject, modify or reverse the change in significant ownership.

Description and   The BRSA has the power to reject any proposal for a change in significant ownership,
findings re EC3   (article 18 of the BL), as each material change (according to predefined thresholds) requires
                  its permission (see also EC2).

                  According to the Article 18 of the BL, the shareholders with qualified shares who do not
                  bear the conditions required for founders any more shall not benefit from the shareholder
                  rights other than dividends. In such cases, other shareholder rights shall be exercised by
                  SDIF, upon the notification of BRSA. Such shareholders shall not use their preferential rights
                  until the rate of their direct or indirect shares in the capital fall below 10 %.

                  If BRSA determines that the change in significant ownership was based on false information,
                  according to the article 155 of BL, those persons may be sentenced to imprisonment from
                  one year to three years and a judicial fine which shall not be less than 1,500 days.

EC4               The supervisor obtains from banks, through periodic reporting or on-site examinations, the
                  names and holdings of all significant shareholders or those that exert controlling influence,
                  including the identities of beneficial owners of shares being held by nominees, custodians
                  and through vehicles that might be used to disguise ownership.

Description and   Banks are required to submit their detailed shareholders structure on a monthly basis by
findings re EC4   means of a surveillance report. This report covers name and country of the owner, the size
                  of holding, share percentage, control type (qualified, preferred shares, jointly control, non-
                  controlling share etc.) and the way of ownership (directly owned, from public offering).
                  Additionally, in order to evaluate qualified legal entity shareholders’ ownership structure,
                  the BRSA requires one additional surveillance report semiannually.

EC5               The supervisor has the power to take appropriate action to modify, reverse or otherwise
                  address a change of control that has taken place without the necessary notification to or
                  approval from the supervisor.

Description and   According to the Article 18 of the BL, transferring of shares affected without permission
findings re EC5   shall not be recorded in the book of shares. Any records made in the book of shares in
                  breach of the foregoing provision shall be null and void. Furthermore, article 18 also
                  establishes that in cases where the shares are transferred without the permission of the
                  Board, the shareholder rights of the legal entity stemming from these shares, other than
                  dividends, shall be exercised by the SDIF.

EC6               Laws or regulations or the supervisor require banks to notify the supervisor as soon as they
                  become aware of any material information which may negatively affect the suitability of a
                  major shareholder or a party that has a controlling interest.

Description and   According to 11(5) of RTSPIO “The board of directors is under obligation to take actions
findings re EC6   and measures for determination of whether a prior consent of the [BRSA] Board is taken for
                  participants of bank general assembly meetings within the frame of obligations arising out
                  of Article 18 of the Law, except for third, seventh and eighth paragraphs thereof.”

                  The BRSA explained that in order to fulfill the determination of the RTSPIO mentioned
                  above as well as the determinations of article 18 of the BL, banks notify the BRSA when a
                  shareholder no longer meets the criteria for major shareholders.

principle 6

Comments          The power given to the supervisor by laws and regulations as well as the current procedures
                  provide broadly sound control and oversight regarding significant ownership of a bank and
                  a controlling company.

Principle 7       Major acquisitions. The supervisor has the power to approve or reject (or recommend to
                  the responsible authority the approval or rejection of), and impose prudential conditions
                  on, major acquisitions or investments by a bank, against prescribed criteria, including the

                     establishment of cross-border operations, and to determine that corporate affiliations or
                     structures do not expose the bank to undue risks or hinder effective supervision.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws or regulations clearly define:

                     a)   what types and amounts (absolute and/or in relation to a bank’s capital) of acquisitions
                          and investments need prior supervisory approval; and
                     b)   cases for which notification after the acquisition or investment is sufficient. Such cases
                          are primarily activities closely related to banking and where the investment is small
                          relative to the bank’s capital.

Description and      Turkish laws and regulations require that all banks investments, with the exception of banks
findings re EC1      trading operations, need supervisory approval.

                     Cross border investments of banks require the BRSA approval according to the article 14 of
                     the BL and article 9 of RTSPIO. In order to be allowed to make a cross border investment,
                     banks’ practices should be in line with corporate governance and safeguarding provisions
                     of the BL. Furthermore, there should be no obstacles in gathering information and
                     executing supervision on the cross border company.

                     Previous permission for participating or establishing a domestic partnership is required by
                     the article 8 of the RTSPIO. Additionally, article 57 of the BL prohibits banks to invest in
                     entities whose main field of activity is property trading, except for mortgage financing
                     institutions and real estate investment trusts.

                     The mentioned provisions of RTSPIO are not applied on investments made on shares for
                     trading purposes, or on acquisition of shares solely for collection and recovery of
                     receivables, or on participation in capital increases of partnerships.

                     Finally, article 56 of the BL limits the acquisition of shares by banks at undertakings other
                     than credit institutions and financial institutions at an amount of 15% of its own funds, and
                     the total amount of its shares in these undertakings shall not be more than 60 % of its own
                     funds. Any investment in excess of the above limits is deducted from bank’s equity for
                     capital adequacy purposes.

EC2                  Laws or regulations provide criteria by which to judge individual proposals

Description and      The regulatory framework determines that the investment of banks domestically and
findings re EC2      abroad needs to comply with corporate governance and protective provisions.

                     According to article 14 of the BL, banks established in Turkey may open branches or
                     representative offices abroad, including off-shore banking regions, set up undertakings or
                     participate in existing undertakings on the condition that they comply with the corporate
                     governance and protective provisions, such as capital and liquidity adequacy or large
                     exposures limits (article 43, 44, 45, 46, 54, 57 of BL).

                     According to the article 8 of RTSPIO, banks established in Turkey may set up undertakings
                     or participate in existing undertakings at home as long as they comply with the corporate

                    governance and protective provisions, such as capital and liquidity adequacy or large
                    exposures limits (article 43, 44, 45, 46, 54, 57 of BL) and the principles established by BRSB.
                    The permission to allow the investments is decided by the BRSA board.

                    Article 9 of RTSPIO requires banks planning to invest in or establish foreign entities to
                    submit to the BRSA a detailed feasibility study indicating sums of funds necessary, an
                    analysis of costs and benefits concerning the proposed activity, estimated balance sheets,
                    cash flows and profit/loss schedules which set forth targets for three years from foundation.

                    The assessors could see examples showing that in practice the application of articles 8 and
                    9 of RTSPIO require the applicant banks to be compliant with management, internal
                    systems, financial reporting and prudential requirements such as capital adequacy, liquidity,
                    asset quality, provisioning and large exposures limits as stipulated in the BL and regulations.
                    The BRSA also verifies that there should be no obstacles in gathering information and
                    conducting supervision of the cross border company. If needed, the BRSA may require an
                    MoU with the host supervisory authority.

EC3                 Consistent with the licensing requirements, among the objective criteria that the supervisor
                    uses, is that any new acquisitions and investments do not expose the bank to undue risks or
                    hinder effective supervision. The supervisor also determines, where appropriate, that these
                    new acquisitions and investments will not hinder effective implementation of corrective
                    measures in the future. 16 The supervisor can prohibit banks from making major
                    acquisitions/investments (including the establishment of cross-border banking operations)
                    in countries with laws or regulations prohibiting information flows deemed necessary for
                    adequate consolidated supervision. The supervisor takes into consideration the
                    effectiveness of supervision in the host country and its own ability to exercise supervision
                    on a consolidated basis.

Description and     The BRSA analyses, as part of the approval process, the risks posed by new acquisitions and
findings re EC3     investments to the banking group. The analysis is performed mainly by the evaluation of a
                    detailed feasibility study submitted by banks. Compliance with prudential measures such as
                    capital and liquidity adequacy is also verified. Please also refer to EC2.

                    Powers attributed to the BRSA by the BL allows effective supervision of domestic
                    undertakings (see CP 1 and 12 for discussion). Consistent with the licensing criteria,
                    according to Article 9 of RTSPIO, there should be no obstacles in gathering information and
                    conducting supervision of the cross border company and, where necessary, the BRSA may
                    require an MoU with the host supervisory authority. Nevertheless, there is no explicit
                    consideration about the effectiveness of supervision in the host countries.

EC4                 The supervisor determines that the bank has, from the outset, adequate financial,
                    managerial and organizational resources to handle the acquisition/investment.




16In the case of major acquisitions, this determination may take into account whether the acquisition or investment
creates obstacles to the orderly resolution of the bank.

Description and         Based on the laws and regulations explained in EC 2, banks are required to submit a
findings re EC4         detailed feasibility study indicating necessary resources, costs and benefits analysis of the
                        proposed activity, estimated balance sheets and cash flows and profit/loss estimates for the
                        following three years from foundation. The BRSA evaluates the submitted study during the
                        process of granting permission. The regulation (RTSPIO) is explicit about the required study
                        only for cross border investments, but the assessors also observed examples where
                        domestic investments were analyzed in similar terms. Additionally, Article 8/7 of RTSPIO
                        requires banks to submit a report explaining the reasoning behind the proposed domestic
                        investment.

EC5                     The supervisor is aware of the risks that non-banking activities can pose to a banking group
                        and has the means to take action to mitigate those risks. The supervisor considers the
                        ability of the bank to manage these risks prior to permitting investment in non-banking
                        activities.

Description and         The assessment of the risks that non-banking activities can pose to a banking group is
findings re EC5         mostly assessed in the CAMELS rating process (see CP8). The process involves the
                        assessment of many topics, including the risk that subsidiaries and other entities of the
                        group may represent to the bank. The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process of
                        Banks (ICAAP) and its revision by the supervisor also address risks from non-banking
                        activities. The opinion formulated on these assessments is reflected in the decision to
                        permit banks to invest in non-banking activities.

                        Finally, the BL sets limit for investing in non-financial activities. According to article 56 of BL,
                        a bank shall not acquire shares in entities other than credit institutions and financial
                        institutions in excess of 15 % of its own funds, and the total amount of such investments
                        shall not be more than 60 %of its own funds. Any investment in excess of the above limits
                        reduce bank’s equity for capital adequacy purposes.

AC1                     The supervisor reviews major acquisitions or investments by other entities in the banking
                        group to determine that these do not expose the bank to any undue risks or hinder
                        effective supervision. The supervisor also determines, where appropriate, that these new
                        acquisitions and investments will not hinder effective implementation of corrective
                        measures in the future. 17 Where necessary, the supervisor is able to effectively address the
                        risks to the bank arising from such acquisitions or investments.

Principle 7

Comments                The regulatory framework subjects major acquisitions and investments by banks and
                        controlling companies to prior approval by the BRSA. The BRSA also has well established
                        supervisory practices to limit and monitor risks arising from such activities. Going forward,

                     supervisors should consider more extensively and formally the effectiveness of supervision
                     in host countries.

Principle 8          Supervisory approach. An effective system of banking supervision requires the supervisor
                     to develop and maintain a forward-looking assessment of the risk profile of individual
                     banks and banking groups, proportionate to their systemic importance; identify, assess and
                     address risks emanating from banks and the banking system as a whole; have a framework
                     in place for early intervention; and have plans in place, in partnership with other relevant
                     authorities, to take action to resolve banks in an orderly manner if they become non-viable.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The supervisor uses a methodology for determining and assessing on an ongoing basis the
                     nature, impact and scope of the risks:

                     a)   which banks or banking groups are exposed to, including risks posed by entities in the
                          wider group; and
                     b)   which banks or banking groups present to the safety and soundness of the banking
                          system
                     The methodology addresses, among other things, the business focus, group structure, risk
                     profile, internal control environment and the resolvability of banks, and permits relevant
                     comparisons between banks. The frequency and intensity of supervision of banks and
                     banking groups reflect the outcome of this analysis.

Description and      The supervisory approach of the BRSA is defined in the RAA as a dynamic risk-focused (RFS)
findings re EC1      one that aims to ensure efficiency, continue adequacy of supervision and efficient allocation
                     of supervisory resources. The approach proposes to shape supervision form, scope, time,
                     content and intensity based on the risk profile and adequacy of internal controls and risk
                     management systems of each institution.

                     The BRSA’s methodology for ongoing supervision of banks, established in the Supervisory
                     Manual on Banking Supervision Process (SMBSP) is organized in supervisory cycles that last
                     one year.

                     Main Players

                     Three different departments play major roles in the supervisory cycle:

                     - The audit departments are responsible for on-site inspections. That includes special
                     inspections, complementary inspections and the Camels rating system (see below).

                     - The off-site department analyzes various indicators related to bank’s financial
                     performance in different periods and prepares periodical reports on issues of concern. The
                     analysis made by the off-site team aims to provide feedback and early warning mechanism
                     for emerging risks for on-site inspections.

                     - The enforcement department is responsible for the formal communication between banks
                     and the BRSA in relation to corrective measures. Findings of the audit and off-site

department are analyzed by the enforcement department that proposes supervisory actions
to the BRSB or another competent authority within the BRSA.

Planning

The first phase of the cycle is the strategic planning. Based on previous accumulated
knowledge this phase sets a high level plan for on-site inspections, listing the banks that
will be assessed and broadly allocating the personal for each activity. The plan is elaborated
by the heads of the audit departments and is approved by the chairman.

One of the main inputs of the planning phase is the risk profile of the bank, represented by
its supervisory rating and its systemic importance. More specifically, the SMBSP determines
that the minimum frequency of inspections depends on:

- The sector share (SS) of bank’s total risk weighted exposure amount,

- Bank’s final rating which is assigned by the supervision team at the end of the supervision
process. (10 is the worst, 1 is the best rating)

Banks are mapped into three different categories, “red”, “yellow” and “green”, based on the
above indicators and the following matrix:

        Category of Banks         Final Rating

                                  10,9,8,7,6     4,5              3,2,1

                       SS≥3       Red            Red              Yellow
        Sector Share




                       3>SS≥0,5   Red            Yellow           Green

                       0,5>SS     Yellow         Green            Green

Banks in the “red” category are examined on-site annually, banks in the “yellow” category
are examined at least once every two years and the banks in “green” category are examined
at least once every three years. The BRSA explained that even though the rule would allow
some of the largest banks to be assessed every other year, in practice they are examined
annually due to its systemic importance.

Identification of Risk Areas (IRA)

Banks selected to be assessed on-site are subject to the IRA phase of the supervisory cycle.
The IRA aims to provide a snapshot of the risks of different areas of the bank. This phase is
meant to be a short initial assessment based mainly on previous available information,
including the latest risk matrix and profile, CAMELS rating, internal capital adequacy
assessment process (ICAAP) report, special and complementary inspections and off-site
reports. The IRA produces an initial opinion about the riskiness of different areas of the
bank and a supervision plan identifying the specific areas that are going to be subject to
special inspections. Camels rating assessment is performed in all other areas.

Special Inspections (SI)




                                                                                              49
TURKEY



         Special Inspections (SI), as described in the Supervisory Manual on Special Inspections
         Report, are detailed on-site inspections meant to assess risks and quality of management in
         a particular area under inspection. SI are meant to reveal problems that have the potential
         to affect the financial soundness of the bank and identify measures that should be required
         from banks to resolve eventual problems and mitigate risks. The number of Special
         Inspections conducted in 2014 and 2015 were 61 and 44 respectively. Among these 105 SI,
         there were 70 SI conducted on loan portfolios in 27 different banks.

         SIs are deep evaluations performed in three levels. The first level checks the adequacy of
         internal evaluations made by banks aiming to determine whether or not the bank manages
         well its activities and risks arising from those activities. The second level contrasts banks
         practices with BRSA best practice guidelines and finally, the last level examine specific
         transactions and operations through sampling methodology looking for potential issues
         that might affect the financial soundness of the bank.

         SIs may have different themes, for instance, specific credit portfolios, business model and
         profitability, information systems, liquidity management and derivatives among others.

         CAMELS rating and risk profile

         The CAMELS rating phase of the supervisory cycle is conducted by analyses of the financial
         soundness of the bank and the assessment of the efficiency of the bank's general risk
         profile, risk management and internal control and internal audit systems. The analyses is
         guided by a series of almost five hundred questions, contained in the Annex of the General
         Assessment Report (GAR), that supervisors are required to answer using as inputs the IRA
         evaluation, SI and ICAAP reports, banks data and discussion with bank managers. Relevant
         information is scanned and included in system in order to substantiate the response to the
         questions. The results of this phase are a financial structure and rating report, risk matrix,
         risk profile and their view of the ICAAP report submitted by banks.

         Complementary analyses.

         Once the SI and rating processes are completed, the BRSA executes a series of additional
         on-site inspections that usually have a stronger compliance nature. These inspections cover
         issues such as legal concerns, policies and processes on anti-money laundering and
         combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and follow up on supervisory findings and
         consumer complaints. Also see CP 29 to discussion on AML/CFT inspections.

         Additionally, supervision teams may also perform thematic reviews considering
         developments and trends in the banking sector or significant specific changes to the
         operation of the bank.

         Banks not been assessed on-site

         Banks within “yellow” and “green” categories, that are not been assessed on-site in one
         particular year (e.g., have not been submitted to IRA, SI, rating and complementary
         inspections) should be assessed by the supervision teams of the audit department at least
         every six month (green category) or quarterly (yellow) through off-site reports including

                                                                                       TURKEY



"Monthly Report of Follow-Up of Compliance with Legal Limits", "Monthly Report of Ratios
Follow-Up" and "Monthly Report". The SMBSP manual requests that the evaluations shall
not be limited to the mentioned surveillance reports but also take into account the effects
of current macroeconomic developments on the financial soundness of the bank, as well as
the changes in shareholder structure and similar issues.

Off-site supervision

During the whole process, on-site supervision teams from the audit department have access
to off-site reports regarding banks and other financial companies on a solo and
consolidated basis. These reports include stress test and various prudential ratios of the
bank and its peers. Additionally, during on-site inspections, supervisors have easy access to
comprehensive databases with information of banks and its groups. See CP 10 for
additional information.

Furthermore, within the scope of the off-site supervision function, the BRSA monitors
individual banks and the banking sector as a whole, evaluates potential risks and informs
on-site teams and upper management about present or emerging vulnerabilities. Bank
surveillance reports, periodic and non-periodic thematic reports, stress tests and banking
sector presentations are the main outputs of off-site supervision (also refer to CP 9).

Practice

The assessors reviewed examples of inputs, working papers and outputs of the different
phases of the supervisory cycle. The review suggested that the practical implementation of
the supervisory manuals face challenges that might hinder the quality of the process and its
products. One of the shortcomings is an excessive compliance nature of the inspections.
Although the declared goal of all the different inspections is to evaluate the risks faced by
the bank, in practice the inspections appear to focus extensively on establishing compliance
with the different regulations. The inspections seem to fall short of developing a clear view
on the risks faced and posed by the bank and particularly important on the potential need
for broader and more forceful supervisory action. To support this process, supervisors need
to establish and highlight the implications of the findings of specific inspections for the
broader risk assessment of the bank, which frequently does not seem to be the case.

Another point that needs to be considered is the strength and weaknesses of the CAMELS
rating process. The process is comprehensive and requires supervisors to collect a large set
of information to be able to provide answers on almost five hundred different criteria.
Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that, by its own nature, the analyses executed by
the supervisor during the rating process cannot be as deep and comprehensive as the ones
performed, for example, during special inspections. The relatively limited nature of the
ratings is expected and is not necessarily a problem if supervisors frequently take more
detailed approaches to inspect the bank. It is not enough to inspect a number of issues only
during the ratings process. BRSA should not take excessive comfort from the fact that some
issues are analyzed during this phase. From time to time, the scope of special inspections




                                                                                              51
TURKEY



                  needs to encompass issues that currently seem to be addressed only during the ratings
                  phase.

                  Regarding banks that have not been selected to be inspected in one particular year, it was
                  not possible to verify what kind of supervisory attention is given to them due to the fact
                  that the supervisors’ analyses of off-site reports, do not typically deliver a formal
                  assessment. Nevertheless, the possibility embedded in the current methodology of leaving
                  some banks without a structured supervisory assessment for up to three years seems
                  inadequate.

                  Finally, the BRSA has not started to assess the resolvability of banks.

EC2               The supervisor has processes to understand the risk profile of banks and banking groups
                  and employs a well-defined methodology to establish a forward-looking view of the profile.
                  The nature of the supervisory work on each bank is based on the results of this analysis.

Description and   As described in EC 1 and in the Supervisory Manual on Banking Supervision Process
findings re EC2   (SMBSP), the BRSA has a process to understand the risk profile of the banks. Different
                  phases of the supervisory cycle aim to deepen the understanding of the banks risks. From
                  the initial IRA until the Camels rating, the results of the previous phases are used to guide
                  the work that is done subsequently.

                  The criteria for risk assessment are well established in the Supervisory Manual on Risk
                  Assessment Criteria (SMRAC). The final products of the supervisory cycle, particularly the
                  risk matrix and risk profile aims to show the risk types and levels which the banks are
                  exposed to.

                  The most important forward looking element of the methodology is the ICAAP assessment
                  that involves capital projections, by banks, for the following three years under different
                  economic scenario. Nevertheless, the revision of supervisors’ working papers and discussion
                  with banks suggested that the process still is in a learning phase. The quality of banks
                  reports and the scrutiny of the reports by supervisors need to develop further before the
                  results can be more extensively used.

                  Furthermore, as part of the off-site supervision efforts, the BRSA performs top-down stress
                  testing analyses (please refer to CP9). The methodology could provide an important
                  forward looking tool to deepen the assessment of the risk profile of banks and drive
                  supervisory action but the assessors saw little evidence of its use currently during the banks’
                  assessment process.

                  Finally, the CAMELS rating system and the matrix used to summarize the risk profile of the
                  banks does not have an explicit forward looking component that provides an indication of
                  future trends in the soundness of the bank.

EC3               The supervisor assesses banks’ and banking groups’ compliance with prudential regulations
                  and other legal requirements.

Description and   The BL provides an appropriate framework for the BRSA to conduct compliance inspection
findings re EC3   in banks as part of its regular inspection activities. These inspections include compliance
                  with the BL, sub-regulations issued by the BRSA and other regulations applied to banks,
                  including anti-money laundering.

                  The BRSA utilizes a number of tools to assess compliance of banks and banking groups with
                  prudential and other requirements. As described in EC1, on-site supervisors conduct several
                  compliance inspections during the complementary analysis phase of the supervisory cycle.
                  Additionally, the rating process also involves the analysis of banks compliance with
                  regulation and prescribed best practices.

                  Finally, the off-site department generates monthly reports to confirm banks’ consolidated
                  and non-consolidated compliance with prudential regulations and other legal requirements.
                  There is an off-site reporting template supporting a legal requirements check list. When a
                  breach is detected, the BRSA takes necessary actions including demand the correction and
                  applying penalties.

EC4               The supervisor takes the macroeconomic environment into account in its risk assessment of
                  banks and banking groups. The supervisor also takes into account cross-sectoral
                  developments, for example in non-bank financial institutions, through frequent contact with
                  their regulators.

Description and   The BRSA develops macroeconomic analysis that includes local and global conditions that
findings re EC4   might affect the banking system. These analyses are inputs for bank inspections.

                  According to Supervisory Manual for Identifying Risky Areas and Supervision Planning
                  (SMIRASP), inspection teams are expected to examine the diversity and scope of the bank's
                  activities and products, risk appetite, place in the sector, growth plan and strategies. They
                  are also expected to understand the corporate culture of the bank and to have an opinion
                  about the bank's financial soundness and risk profile on a consolidated basis. While forming
                  this opinion, the latest developments affecting all the institutions belonging to the group
                  and its major shareholders, including non-bank activities, should be considered in
                  conjunction with the latest trends and general macroeconomic conditions.

                  As part of the off-site monitoring function, the BRSA develops reports regarding the banks’
                  derivative transactions, CDS spreads, equity prices, that are used by supervision staff and
                  senior management. Depending on market developments and risk factors, specific analysis
                  and reports are also prepared.

                  The macroeconomic environment is also considered in stress testing studies. Top down
                  macro stress testing studies employ a baseline and an adverse scenario and try to estimate
                  how banks and the industry will be affected within a two years’ time frame. Macro variables
                  such as GDP growth, FX rates, interest rates and unemployment rates in alternative
                  scenarios are modeled and related with banks financial structure in terms of credit risk,
                  interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and contagion risk. These analyses help to take account
                  of the macroeconomic environment in both bank supervision and systemic risk analysis.

                  Regarding cross-sectoral developments, the rating process includes a section called
                  consolidated supervision containing questions that aims to evaluate relationship among the
                  bank and other financial and non-financial entities of the group. Additionally, some specific
                  reports are prepared by off-site supervision in order to assess the banking sector as a
                  whole. As mentioned in EC1, the rating process analyses are limited by its own nature.

                  BRSA also participates in a number of committees and working arrangements that allow the
                  collaboration among different financial market supervisors (see CP 1 and 3 for details). In
                  particular, BRSA, Treasury and CMB meet annually to share their findings and concerns and
                  coordinate the supervision efforts toward insurance firms, investment firms, pension fund
                  firms and others which are affiliated with banks.

EC5               The supervisor, in conjunction with other relevant authorities, identifies monitors and
                  assesses the build-up of risks, trends and concentrations within and across the banking
                  system as a whole. This includes, among other things, banks’ problem assets and sources of
                  liquidity (such as domestic and foreign currency funding conditions, and costs). The
                  supervisor incorporates this analysis into its assessment of banks and banking groups and
                  addresses proactively any serious threat to the stability of the banking system. The
                  supervisor communicates any significant trends or emerging risks identified to banks and to
                  other relevant authorities with responsibilities for financial system stability.

Description and   The BRSA requires banks to submit information on a number of issues and converts them in
findings re EC5   a meaningful database for analyzing the financial system. Concentrations and trends are
                  monitored through reports generated from this database.

                  The BRSA off-site supervision function monitors and assesses asset quality, profitability,
                  capital adequacy and liquidity of the individual banks and banking system as a whole by
                  means of periodic reports such as: Bank Surveillance Reports, Weekly Banking Sector
                  Report, Potential Non-Performing Loans Report, Monthly Key Indicators Report, Banking
                  Sector Outlook, Stress Test Report, Country Risk Report, Credit Bureau Individual Credit
                  Rating Results Report, etc.

                  In addition to periodic reports, ad-hoc analysis about emerging risks and tendencies facing
                  the banking sector are also prepared. It was mention, as an example, that because of the
                  size of the open positions of the corporations, FX lending was a potential emerging risk
                  factor for the sector. In the second half of 2015 a survey was conducted on FX loans which
                  covered 2,527 biggest firms (71 % of total FX loans) and gathered information about FX
                  assets, liabilities, income generation capacity and derivatives for hedging FX risks.

                  BRSA findings are discussed in a number of committees with other authorities. Particularly
                  relevant are the FSC and FSEC. See CP 1 and 3 for additional information.

EC6               Drawing on information provided by the bank and other national supervisors, the
                  supervisor, in conjunction with the resolution authority, assesses the bank’s resolvability
                  where appropriate, having regard to the bank’s risk profile and systemic importance. When
                  bank-specific barriers to orderly resolution are identified, the supervisor requires, where
                  necessary, banks to adopt appropriate measures, such as changes to business strategies,

                                                                                                           TURKEY



                  managerial, operational and ownership structures, and internal procedures. Any such
                  measures take into account their effect on the soundness and stability of ongoing business.

Description and   According to the BL, the two authorities with roles in bank resolution are the BRSA and the
findings re EC6   SDIF. They regularly meet to exchange information and discuss measures and policies about
                  banks (please refer to CP3). Additionally, BRSA and SDIF are the members of FSC and FSEC
                  which are formed to increase the coordination, cooperation and information sharing among
                  these institutions.

                  Under the current legislative framework, resolution options and tools are evaluated when
                  the bank is asked to take corrective actions. These options are analyzed taking into account
                  high level considerations such as safeguarding confidence and financial stability, prevailing
                  market conditions and cost-effectiveness of resolution.

                  The BRSA and the SDIF have established a joint working group to analyze the eventual need
                  to change the current resolution regime and align it with FSB’s Key Attributes of Effective
                  Resolution Regimes. As part of this process, the two institutions have agreed to include
                  resolvability assessment into the legislation. The joint working group is still formulating
                  policy proposals and necessary legislative amendments on these issues. For the time being,
                  banks are not required to develop recovery plans and supervisors have not started to assess
                  banks’ resolvability.

EC7               The supervisor has a clear framework or process for handling banks in times of stress, such
                  that any decisions to require or undertake recovery or resolution actions are made in a
                  timely manner.

Description and   The BRSA has the authority to take an appropriate range of remedial actions which are
findings re EC7   stated in the Articles of 68, 69 and 70 of BL. The range of measures is broad and allows
                  appropriate escalation according to the situation (see CP 1 for detailed description).

                  Supervisory procedures are also intensified when banks are under stress. The frequency of
                  inspections increase with the deterioration of the rating of the bank and the number of
                  topics covered in the inspections may also increase due to the number of meaningful
                  weaknesses identified (see details in EC1).

                  When the BRSA decides to initiate the resolution, the process involves either the revocation
                  of the bank’s operating permission (Article 106 BL) or the transfer of the management and
                  control of the bank to the SDIF (Article 107 BL). The decision about the process is based on
                  general considerations, such as the structure of the balance sheet, the amount of deposits
                  and potential wider impact of the different options. After the bank is transferred to the
                  SDIF, the SDIF decides which actions to take in line with its mandate and powers specified
                  in the BL.

                  If the bank is resolved under Article 106, the operating license of the failed bank is revoked
                  and the SDIF makes a pay-out to the insured depositors and apply to the courts for a
                  decision as to whether a bankruptcy proceeding should be initiated for the remainder of




                                                                                                                55

                  the failed bank. If the court rejects the application, the SDIF may start liquidation
                  proceedings through a decision of the SDIF Board.

                  In cases where the BRSA transfers management and control of a bank to the SDIF, the SDIF
                  has wide powers under Article 107 of BL, including to suspend the activities of the bank and
                  manage it, transfer assets and liabilities, take over its shares and restructure it, sell or merge
                  it with another bank, and request the BRSA to revoke the operating license of the bank. The
                  SDIF may also provide financial support to a failing bank if it has acquired all or the majority
                  of its shares.

                  One issue that should be considered in the effectiveness of the framework is that the
                  sharing of communication responsibilities between the audit and the enforcement
                  departments seems to generate a fragmented process that increases the risks that the
                  messages conveyed to the bank do not reflect appropriately supervisory concerns. The
                  speed of actions and decisions might also be affected. Please refer to CP9.

                  As explained in EC6, authorities are studying changes in the current resolution framework to
                  harmonize it with the FSB’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes.

EC8               Where the supervisor becomes aware of bank-like activities being performed fully or
                  partially outside the regulatory perimeter, the supervisor takes appropriate steps to draw
                  the matter to the attention of the responsible authority. Where the supervisor becomes
                  aware of banks restructuring their activities to avoid the regulatory perimeter, the
                  supervisor takes appropriate steps to address this.

Description and   Bank-like activities without the authorization of BRSA are legally punishable. BRSA initiates
findings re EC8   investigations in case of file of complaints or information provided on potentially bank-like
                  activities being performed without required permission. If needed, findings are submitted to
                  the responsible authority for further proper legal actions, including reporting to the
                  prosecutor’s office.

                  The restructuring of a bank that involves establishing a subsidiary or investing in a joint
                  venture requires a prior approval by the BRSA, where the bank needs to provide detailed
                  information regarding structures and activities of the new undertaking. The BRSA explains it
                  would not approve the application if it results in avoidance of the regulatory perimeter.
                  Furthermore, the BRSA receives call reports on the structured of the banking groups and
                  analyze group structure issues during on-site inspections.

Assessment of     Materially Non-compliant
Principle 8

Comments          The BRSA has an established and comprehensive methodology to supervise banks. This
                  methodology is documented on a number of manuals and grounded on comprehensive
                  databases and a broadly appropriate regulatory framework. Nevertheless, the practical
                  implementation of the process is subject to shortcomings that needs to be addressed:

                  •   The inspections need to develop a more profound and forward-looking risk assessment
                      nature, producing a clear view of the risks faced by and posed by the bank. Current



56
                                                                                                                 TURKEY



                          conclusions tend to focus mostly on compliance issues and do not identify and make
                          clear if there is need for broader and more forceful supervisory action. Supervisors also
                          need to derive and highlight the implications of the specific findings for the broader
                          risk assessment of the bank.

                     •    The BRSA should not take excessive comfort from the fact that issues are analyzed
                          during the ratings process. By its own nature, and as currently applied by the BRSA, the
                          ratings process is not deep enough to generate firm and actionable conclusions. From
                          time to time, the scope of special inspections needs to encompass issues that are
                          currently addressed only during the ratings phase.

                     •    The BRSA needs to enhance the forward-looking components of its assessments.
                          Results of the ICAAP need to be more thoroughly analyzed and discussed with banks.
                          Stress tests results should play a larger role in the assessment framework. In addition,
                          the ratings methodology could explicitly incorporate the expected trend for each
                          component.

                     •    Banks, particularly the systemic important ones, should be required to develop recovery
                          plans and the BRSA should assess their resolvability.

                     The assessors understand that the BRSA is already developing actions to address some of
                     the above issues and encourage the authorities to keep working to improve the efficiency
                     of the process.

Principle 9          Supervisory techniques and tools. The supervisor uses an appropriate range of techniques
                     and tools to implement the supervisory approach and deploys supervisory resources on a
                     proportionate basis, taking into account the risk profile and systemic importance of banks.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The supervisor employs an appropriate mix of on-site 18 and off-site 19 supervision to
                     evaluate the condition of banks and banking groups, their risk profile, internal control
                     environment and the corrective measures necessary to address supervisory concerns. The
                     specific mix between on-site and off-site supervision may be determined by the particular
                     conditions and circumstances of the country and the bank. The supervisor regularly
                     assesses the quality, effectiveness and integration of its on-site and off-site functions, and
                     amends its approach, as needed.

Description and      The principles and procedures for the supervision of the institutions under the scope of the
findings re EC1      BRSA are determined by RAA. More specifically, article 5 of the RAA defines that the BRSA


18 On-site work is used as a tool to provide independent verification that adequate policies, procedures and controls
exist at banks, determine that information reported by banks is reliable, obtain additional information on the bank
and its related companies needed for the assessment of the condition of the bank, monitor the bank’s follow-up on
supervisory concerns, etc.
19Off-site work is used as a tool to regularly review and analyze the financial condition of banks, follow up on
matters requiring further attention, identify and evaluate developing risks and help identify the priorities, scope of
further off-site and on-site work, etc.



                                                                                                                         57

         will conduct risk focus supervision (RFS). The RFS approach aims to shape the scope and
         intensity of the supervision taking into consideration the risk profile and the existence and
         adequacy of internal controls and risk management systems of banks.

         The BRSA’s supervision system is composed of two essential activities, on-site and off-site
         supervision which aims to complement and support each other.

         On-site supervision

         On-site supervision covers issues that might have an impact on the financial safety and
         soundness of the bank, including a comprehensive risk assessment of the bank to identify
         its risk profile. On-site supervisors frequently perform: i) comprehensive reviews of the loan
         portfolio and the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control systems; ii) evaluation
         of the compliance of the financial statements and accounts with national and international
         accounting standards; iii) assessment and analysis of the consolidated group; iv) analysis of
         the adequacy and reliability of the information systems of the bank; and v) alignment of the
         operations of the bank with all relevant legislation, among other activities. Bank‘s inherent
         risks are analyzed taking into account its risk management framework as well as its
         compliance with corporate governance principles. Corrective measures are recommended
         when problems are identified. See CP8 for detailed discussion on the supervisory cycle and
         description of on-site main inspections. CP 11 discusses corrective measures.

         Currently there are approximately, 75 on-site examiners assigned to conduct on-site bank
         inspections and 17 examiners assigned to non-bank financial institutions. Another 29
         examiners are responsible for conducting specific examinations regarding customer
         complaints, alleged criminal activities of bank staff, etc, and 8 more are in the internal
         review team. There are also 13 on-site examiners working in the Risk Management and
         Financial Consumer Relations Departments, who are not included in regular bank or non-
         bank institutions’ examinations but they do perform ad hoc examinations that complement
         the regular supervision. Other expert personnel of the BRSA, including law experts and IT
         experts who can also be assigned to these groups when it is deemed necessary. The team
         head usually leads the inspection of the same set of banks for three years while the
         examiners assigned for the team change every supervisory cycle. There are also 50
         examiners that do not belong to the audit departments who are responsible for specific
         inspections not related to prudential issues.

         Off-site supervision

         Off-site supervision activities are carried out analyzing various indicators related to bank’s
         financial performance in different periods and preparing periodical reports on issues of
         concern. Data sources include surveillance call reports, regulatory reports, on-site
         supervision and external audit reports, CBRT and Credit Bureau data, rating agency reports
         and media. Conclusions are immediately reported to other departments and senior
         management.

         The analysis made by the off-site team aims to provide feedback and early warning
         mechanism for emerging risks for on-site inspection. The off-site supervision department



58
                                                                                                         TURKEY



                  produces various periodic reports and analysis on demand, including stress tests (see CP
                  10). Off-site supervision activities are performed by 22 supervisors (average 3 banks per
                  banking expert). These activities have been organized under a separate department aiming
                  to strengthen the off-site function, improve efficiency and ensure standardization.

                  Quality assessment

                  The quality assurance system is defined in the article 7 of RAA. According to this article,
                  quality assurance system comprises all processes in the supervision framework and ensures
                  the improvement of quality in BRSA’s inspections as well as the consistency in inspection
                  reports and their alignment with the standards set forth by the BRSA. The quality assurance
                  system aims to continuously improve the inspection standards. The BRSA assesses the
                  compliance of audit systems and products to internationally-accepted principles and
                  standards as a non-integrated part of quality assurance system and provides them to be
                  subject to an independent analysis.

                  The current quality assurance system seems to be focused on the results of individual on-
                  site inspections, ensuring that the procedures followed by the supervisors are in compliance
                  with the relevant manuals. The BRSA has yet to develop policies and processes to assess
                  more broadly the effectiveness and integration of on-site and off-site functions, and to
                  address any weaknesses that are identified.

EC2               The supervisor has a coherent process for planning and executing on-site and off-site
                  activities. There are policies and processes to ensure that such activities are conducted on a
                  thorough and consistent basis with clear responsibilities, objectives and outputs, and that
                  there is effective coordination and information sharing between the on-site and off-site
                  functions.

Description and   According to Article 10 of RAA, inspection plans are prepared by team leaders, evaluated by
findings re EC2   the heads of departments and submitted to the approval of the Chairman with the assent of
                  the Vice-Chairman.

                  As described in CP8, the specific scope and extent of the supervision process is determined
                  at the strategic planning phase of the supervisory cycle taking into consideration the
                  findings of previous inspections and current risks evaluations. Inspection plans also include
                  the terms of assignment of the examiners and the duties that they are required to perform.

                  The consistency of the supervisory procedures and process are determined by several
                  supervision manuals. These manuals describe the methods and processes for data
                  collection and evaluation as well as other relevant procedures including the report.
                  According to Article 17 of RAA, at the end of the inspection process, the team prepares an
                  inspection report, or a paper formally explaining the opinions of the examiner or a brief
                  information paper, depending on the nature of the inspection.

                  Inspection reports are reviewed by the heads of the audit departments for their compliance
                  with the regulations and guidelines. Inspection products with deficiencies or wrong




                                                                                                                59

                        interpretations are returned to the related expert personnel for correction (article 18 of
                        RAA).

                        Bank’s data, audit reports and internal and external information sources are used and
                        analyzed as part of off-site supervision activities. The process generates individual bank
                        analysis and sector based thematic reports that are shared with the on-site teams and
                        related enforcement departments. As described on CP 10, the off-site team also monitors
                        the quantitative information provided by banks and notifies the on-site examiners of
                        problems responsible for the bank when needed.

                        Supervisory Manuals also include references to off-site reports to be taken into account
                        during the on-site inspection process. For example, SMCEP requires the on-site inspection
                        team to review the off-site reports during the inspection of the loan portfolio of the bank.
                        Additionally, on-site teams are informed about the names and contact information of the
                        banking experts in the off-site supervision function responsible for the bank under
                        examination.

                        In practice there seems to be a large set of off-site reports as well as a comprehensive
                        database available for the supervision work. On-site supervisors refer to it as a tool to
                        facilitate the comparison of financial information; nevertheless, the assessors could not
                        observe many examples of a deeper exchange of information between the on- and off-site
                        supervisors or joint analyses and projects.

EC3                     The supervisor uses a variety of information to regularly review and assess the safety and
                        soundness of banks, the evaluation of material risks, and the identification of necessary
                        corrective actions and supervisory actions. This includes information, such as prudential
                        reports, statistical returns, information on a bank’s related entities, and publicly available
                        information. The supervisor determines that information provided by banks is reliable 20 and
                        obtains, as necessary, additional information on the banks and their related entities.

Description and         The BRSA is empowered by the BL to require banks to submit information on their financial
findings re EC3         condition, performance, and risks on both solo and consolidated basis. These reports
                        provide information on different issues such as on- and off-balance sheet assets and
                        liabilities, profit and loss accounts, capital adequacy, liquidity, large exposures, asset
                        concentrations, asset quality, loan loss provisioning, related party transactions, interest rate
                        and market risk, FX positions and securities positions. The process of collecting and
                        analyzing information from banks is based on a predetermined frequency (daily, monthly,
                        quarterly, semiannually or annually) commensurate with the nature of the information
                        requested and the size, activities and risk profile of the individual bank. In order to make
                        meaningful comparisons between banks and banking groups, the BRSA collects data from
                        all banks and all relevant entities covered by consolidated supervision on a comparable
                        basis and related to the same dates and periods. These data forms a database which can be
                        easily accessed by supervisors.

                  A number of control procedures are applied to improve data quality. The data source is
                  checked in terms of reliability, correctness and consistency. In this respect, banks’ call
                  reports are checked from different sources and verified throughout the supervision process.
                  The control procedures are applied on both client and server sides to provide consistency
                  of the data. To maintain a regular reporting cycle, the system produces and sends the
                  required warnings to institutions such as expected reports, reporting latency, errors in
                  consistency checks and so on. Completed and consistent reporting sets are locked to
                  protect the data from unauthorized changes.

                  Please refer to CP10 for detailed discussion on information available for the supervision
                  process.

EC4               The supervisor uses a variety of tools to regularly review and assess the safety and
                  soundness of banks and the banking system, such as:

                  a)   analysis of financial statements and accounts;
                  b)   business model analysis;
                  c)   horizontal peer reviews;
                  d)   review of the outcome of stress tests undertaken by the bank; and
                  e)   analysis of corporate governance, including risk management and internal control
                       systems.
                  The supervisor communicates its findings to the bank as appropriate and requires the bank
                  to take action to mitigate any particular vulnerabilities that have the potential to affect its
                  safety and soundness. The supervisor uses its analysis to determine follow-up work
                  required, if any.

Description and   During the supervisory cycle a large number of tools are used to assess and monitor the
findings re EC4   safety and soundness of banks. See CP 8 above.

                  Using a variety of tools, on-site and off-site supervision perform analysis of financial
                  statements and accounts. Business model analyses are performed in special inspections
                  and, to some extent, within the rating process. Off-site reports with peer group
                  comparisons on a number of subjects are available for on-site supervisors who also conduct
                  horizontal analysis in complementary inspections. The outcome of stress tests undertaken
                  by the banks is reviewed within the context of the ICAAP assessment. Finally, analysis of
                  corporate governance, including risk management and internal control systems are carefully
                  taking into consideration by the on-site team in several phases of the supervisory cycle.

                  Supervisors conduct formal and informal meetings with the bank management as well as
                  other relevant bank personnel and share their opinions on issues such as risk management
                  systems, banks’ financial performance, capital adequacy and any other relevant subject. On-
                  site inspection team members are in contact with institutions’ middle and senior
                  management during the supervision process.

                  The on-site inspection team follows up the correction and/or mitigation of any vulnerability
                  identified during the supervision framework. The supervisory findings, corrected by the
                  bank under inspection prior to the finalization of the supervision cycle, are communicated



                                                                                                                61

                  by the bank to the inspection team. Any uncorrected deficiencies are scrutinized in the
                  inspection reports. These reports are sent to the enforcement department that is
                  responsible for the formal correspondence of examination reports which are sent to the
                  bank. Related inspection teams are informed about bank’s actions with regard to the
                  correction of deficiencies.

                  The assessors observed the communication process between banks and supervisors and
                  consider that there is room for improvement. Initially, communication with the bank’s board
                  could be strengthened. It would be helpful, for instance, setting policies establishing at least
                  one annual meeting between supervisors and the board of the bank. The end of the rating
                  process, when the supervisor summarizes the opinion about the bank, might be an
                  appropriate occasion to explain the supervisors’ views and concerns to the board.
                  Additionally, other important analyses done by the BRSA, such as the stress testing
                  exercises could also be more formally discussed with the banks. Finally, the sharing of
                  communication responsibilities between the audit and the enforcement departments seems
                  to generate a fragmented process that increases the risks that the messages conveyed to
                  the bank do not reflect appropriately supervisory concerns.

EC5               The supervisor, in conjunction with other relevant authorities, seeks to identify, assess and
                  mitigate any emerging risks across banks and to the banking system as a whole, potentially
                  including conducting supervisory stress tests (on individual banks or system-wide). The
                  supervisor communicates its findings as appropriate to either banks or the industry and
                  requires banks to take action to mitigate any particular vulnerabilities that have the
                  potential to affect the stability of the banking system, where appropriate. The supervisor
                  uses its analysis to determine follow-up work required, if any.

Description and   Stress tests are conducted as a part of the off-site supervision activities. Mainly it is a top
findings re EC5   down macro stress testing study to assess the resilience of Turkish Banks and the Turkish
                  Banking System to extreme but plausible events. It is based on the Macro Stress Testing
                  Model developed by European Central Bank’s Technical Assistance in 2011. It has been
                  modified to fit the data, needs and approaches peculiar to Turkish banking system. It has
                  also been customized with satellite models.

                  There are two macro scenarios in the model, the baseline scenario and the adverse scenario.
                  Macro scenarios include GDP growth, FX rates, Interest Rates and Unemployment rates. The
                  goal is to estimate how the Turkish banking industry might be affected within a two years
                  period. Each bank is considered in the stress tests on solo basis. Individual results are
                  aggregated to build the industry assessment.

                  The “baseline scenario” is formed by using market expectations extracted from information
                  sources such as CBRT Market Survey and Bloomberg expectations and expert judgment.
                  The “adverse scenario” depends on a “sudden stop” scenario based on a serious increase in
                  rollover in government and private borrowing and a slowdown in international capital flows.
                  This 1st year shock causes pressure on markets and increase interest rates and FX rates,
                  resulting in an economic slowdown. The effects last for 2 years.

Main risks included are credit risk, interest rate risk (duration method for trading book,
income method for the banking book), exchange rate risk and contagion effects.

A major part of the stress testing approach is the satellite (auxiliaries) models used to
estimate the growth in the loan portfolio and the increase in the non-performing loans as a
function of the macro scenarios for the following two years. The model uses quarterly panel
data to estimate growth rates broken down by commercial and retail portfolios.

Final results are summarized using changes to the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) that are
compared to the 8% and 12% regulatory prescriptions. If the resulting CARs are below
these levels, the banks are highlighted together with their potential capital need. On-site
inspection teams are informed of the findings of stress tests. Moreover, Core Tier I, Tier I
and CAR are evaluated as well. In addition to the Macro Stress Testing Model, several
sensitivity and what if analyses are performed. Short term FX and interest rate sensitivities
of the Turkish Banking Sector are tested separately. The process includes tests of 10% to
30% increases in FX rates and 100 bps to 300 bps increases in interest. Moreover, loan
losses threshold high enough to reduce banks’ CAR below 8% and 12% are examined.
Additionally, the effects of “what if all loans under follow up are classified as NPL” are
measured for each bank.

Stress tests are conducted on a quarterly basis. They are reported internally twice a year and
presented to the Chairman, Vice Chairmanships of Supervision and Enforcement. Results are
evaluated by on site, off site supervisors and the related BRSA staff internally.

Liquidity Tests are only conducted when required by the BRSB. Liquidity tests use the
“Implied Cash-flow Test” which tries to estimate how the banking system will be affected
under two scenarios applied on a bank by bank basis. The first scenario assumes that there
will be no deposit withdrawal within the industry, but there will be a reduction in the non-
deposit liabilities due to unrolled foreign funding (1 month remaining maturity foreign
borrowings are not renewed). The second scenario adds the assumptions of deposit
withdrawals (10% for TRL, 20% for FX deposit) to the first Scenario. In addition, 15% to 50%
haircuts are considered for liquid assets.

Finally, as part of the ICAAP, banks have to maintain their stress testing programs. This
regulation requires banks to have detailed stress testing programs consistent with their size
and complexity. Tests for market risk, counterparty credit risk and liquidity risks are required
to be conducted at least once a month and bank wide extensive stress tests with all risk
factors are required to be conducted at least once a year. Banks are also required to apply
the BRSA’s scenarios if given. The RICAAP regulation maintains an interaction between
banks’ stress testing results and internal capital adequacy calculations. The BRSA is
authorized to enforce banks to mitigate risk or to hold additional reserve depending on the
stress test results. ICAAP results with stress testing outputs are collected and examined in
the supervision process.

The BRSA does not disclose the results of the stress tests to banks.

EC6               The supervisor evaluates the work of the bank’s internal audit function, and determines
                  whether, and to what extent, it may rely on the internal auditors’ work to identify areas of
                  potential risk.

Description and   An effective internal audit system is one of the requirements for the establishment of a
findings re EC6   bank in Turkey. According to the article 29 of the BL, banks are obliged to establish and
                  operate adequate and efficient internal audit systems that are compatible with the scope
                  and structure of their activities. The BL also determines the internal audit systems to involve
                  all banks’ units, branches and undertakings subject to consolidation. Banks’ internal auditors
                  must investigate the conformity of the banking activities to the legislation, articles of
                  association, internal regulations and banking principles. Internal audit activities should be
                  performed in an impartial and independent manner exercising due professional care by the
                  adequate number of auditors.

                  Further principles and procedures for the establishment and functioning of the internal
                  control, internal audit, and risk management systems are established in the RICAAP. The
                  RICAAP also gives banks the obligation to report to the BRSA a number of issues related to
                  the internal audit function including but not limited to their internal regulations,
                  organizational structure, audit plans and reports submitted to the board of directors.

                  Compliance with all requirements set out in RICAAP are verified by the BRSA‘s supervisors
                  that according to article 14 of the RAA should analyze the adequacy and efficiency of the
                  risk management, internal control and internal audit systems of the banks. During the on-
                  site inspection, supervisors examine whether the internal audit function has sufficient
                  resources, appropriate independence, full access to and communication with any member
                  of staff, employ a methodology that identifies the material risks and prepares an audit plan
                  based on its own risk assessment and allocates its resources accordingly. Financial
                  Soundness Analysis Software Package (FSASP) includes a number of criteria to evaluate the
                  internal audit function of the bank.

EC7               The supervisor maintains sufficiently frequent contacts as appropriate with the bank’s
                  Board, non-executive Board members and senior and middle management (including heads
                  of individual business units and control functions) to develop an understanding of and
                  assess matters such as strategy, group structure, corporate governance, performance,
                  capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, risk management systems and internal controls.
                  Where necessary, the supervisor challenges the bank’s Board and senior management on
                  the assumptions made in setting strategies and business models.

Description and   On-site examiners have frequent formal and informal meetings with different personnel of
findings re EC7   the bank during their analysis inspections and follow-up. In these meetings conducted with
                  the bank management as well as other relevant bank personnel, supervisors share their
                  opinions on issues such as risk management systems, banks’ financial performance, bank’s
                  strategies, group structure, corporate governance, liquidity, asset quality, capital adequacy
                  and any other relevant subjects. In cases where some important issues are detected, they

                  are immediately reported to BRSA management and the BRSA management organizes
                  formal meetings with the bank upper management to discuss such issues.

                  Additionally, the RAA provides a framework for more official contact. Heads of audit
                  departments are formally responsible for organizing official meetings to be held with
                  institutions under the supervisory and regulatory framework of the BRSA and with
                  institutions providing service to these institutions. It also stipulates that, within the
                  framework of carrying out risk evaluations and building up the risk profile of the
                  institutions, inspections should be preceded by introductory meetings with the
                  management of the bank. Along the same lines, according to SMBSP, in the process of IRA,
                  the on-site inspection team collects the information required for completing the
                  supervision plans and makes introductory meetings with the bank management.

                  There are also explicit requirements for inspection findings to be shared with the bank
                  management in conclusion meetings under the coordination of the Group Head. The
                  purpose of the conclusion meeting is to receive the opinions of the bank management
                  about inspection findings and conclude the inspection report taking into account these
                  opinions to the extent necessary.

                  Banks confirmed that supervisors maintain regular communications with them. Although it
                  was clear that supervisors have access to all levels of staff in the bank, as discussed in EC4,
                  there is opportunity for improvement in terms of frequency of meetings with the board and
                  in the issues disclosed and discussed.

EC8               The supervisor communicates to the bank the findings of its on- and off-site supervisory
                  analyses in a timely manner by means of written reports or through discussions or meetings
                  with the bank’s management. The supervisor meets with the bank’s senior management
                  and the Board to discuss the results of supervisory examinations and the external audits, as
                  appropriate. The supervisor also meets separately with the bank’s independent Board
                  members, as necessary.

Description and   As discussed in EC 4, 5 and 7, the BRSA maintains regular communication with the bank by
findings re EC8   means of written reports and through discussion with the management. Nevertheless, as
                  previously mentioned, there seems to be room for improvement, particularly concerning
                  establishing a policy for minimum frequency of meetings with board members and
                  communication of off-site findings like stress test results.

EC9               The supervisor undertakes appropriate and timely follow-up to check that banks have
                  addressed supervisory concerns or implemented requirements communicated to them. This
                  includes early escalation to the appropriate level of the supervisory authority and to the
                  bank’s Board if action points are not addressed in an adequate or timely manner.

Description and   The BRSA has a broad range of powers to impose remedial actions and escalate it as
findings re EC9   needed. For a detailed discussion see CP1.

                  Remedial measures are addressed to the banks’ Board in a written document and banks are
                  required to prepare a rehabilitation plan within a time period and a framework approved by




                                                                                                                 65

                   the BRSA. The bank should submit regular written progress reports according to the plan
                   that is approved and the severity of the matter. Progress reports are regularly monitored by
                   the BRSA and shared with the supervision departments to follow up whether remedial
                   actions have been completed satisfactorily.

                   When important issues have not been addressed, they are immediately reported to BRSA
                   management that takes the appropriate measures.

EC10               The supervisor requires banks to notify it in advance of any substantive changes in their
                   activities, structure and overall condition, or as soon as they become aware of any material
                   adverse developments, including breach of legal or prudential requirements.

Description and    The regulatory framework in Turkey demands banks to notify the BRSA in a number of
findings re EC10   changes and material developments. Article 43 of the BL demands notification in case the
                   restrictions and threshold related to the standard ratios set in BL are breached.

                   The RICAAP requires banks to notify or to submit to the BRSA a number of topics including:
                   i) appointment or resign of the internal systems manager or committee members, the
                   members of the audit committee, and the senior managers of the units included within the
                   scope of these systems; ii) changes to internal regulations concerning the duties, powers
                   and responsibilities of the audit committee and of the internal systems manager and the
                   organizational structure, duties, powers and responsibilities of the internal audit unit, the
                   risk management unit and the internal control unit; iii) changes in their approved risk
                   management policies and implementation procedures as well as their new strategy and

                   Additionally, the RICAAP demands banks to promptly submit to the BRSA an action plan
                   when the current capital adequacy ratio is below the internal capital requirement ratio
                   (ICRR). The plan enters into practice after being approved by the Agency. At the end of the
                   period foreseen in the plan, a new ICAAP Report is prepared and results of the action plan
                   are submitted to the Agency.

EC11               The supervisor may make use of independent third parties, such as auditors, provided there
                   is a clear and detailed mandate for the work. However, the supervisor cannot outsource its
                   prudential responsibilities to third parties. When using third parties, the supervisor assesses
                   whether the output can be relied upon to the degree intended and takes into consideration
                   the biases that may influence third parties.

Description and    According to Article 95 of the BL, the chairman of the BRSA has the authority to commission
findings re EC11   independent audit firms to examine specific matters that require expertise where he or she
                   deems necessary. However, the BRSA is not legally authorized to outsource its prudential
                   responsibilities to third parties.

                   Third parties are not extensively used for supervision purposes. Information Systems is one
                   of the few areas where there is a more relevant reliance on external audit firms. External

                   auditors are utilized for annual audits which are defined in RITEA after being previously
                   approved by the BRSA. Their reports are evaluated by BRSA experts that subsequently send
                   an official letter informing banks about the evaluation results and deadlines for the
                   corrective actions.

                   The BRSA has the authority to monitor the quality of work done by external auditors for
                   supervisory purposes. According to Article 17 of the Regulation on the External Audit of
                   Banks (REAB), external audit firms are obliged to send to the BRSA all information and
                   documents related to their audit when it is demanded and should keep them ready for the
                   BRSA supervision.

EC12               The supervisor has an adequate information system which facilitates the processing,
                   monitoring and analysis of prudential information. The system aids the identification of
                   areas requiring follow-up action.

Description and    The BRSA utilizes an information system specially designed to support the whole
findings re EC12   supervisory cycle. The FSASP supports all the steps of process including IRA, SI and CRRE.
                   The software comprises both risk assessment and CAMELS rating modules in harmonization
                   with the supervision manuals. It also includes criteria (via questions) to be assessed during
                   the on-site inspection process. The FSASP stipulates the working papers to be recorded. It
                   also allows supervisors to produce risk profile and risk matrix of the banks. In addition, the
                   final rating of the bank is also derived from the assessments in that software. This
                   information is used for follow up actions.

                   Banks data are also stored in appropriate databases that allow supervisors to develop
                   queries for analyzing prudential issues relatively easily.

                   Please also refer to the BCP 10 for detailed reporting structure.

Additional
criteria

AC1                The supervisor has a framework for periodic independent review, for example by an internal
                   audit function or third party assessor, of the adequacy and effectiveness of the range of its
                   available supervisory tools and their use, and makes changes as appropriate.

Principle 9

Comments           The BRSA employs an array of tools and techniques to carry out its supervisory
                   responsibilities. On-site and off-site functions are relevant and well developed. The different
                   departments also share their findings with each other, but their work seems to be
                   conducted in parallel with little coordination. The departments do not seem to have joint
                   projects and supervisors rarely exchange views beyond written reports. As required by EC1,
                   it is important for the BRSA to develop policies and processes to assess the effectiveness




                                                                                                               67

                         and integration of on-site and off-site functions, and to address any weaknesses that are
                         identified. Increasing the rotation between on- and off- site supervisors could also help the
                         integration of the areas.

                         Communication with banks could also be improved. The BRSA should consider setting
                         policies establishing at least one annual meeting between supervisors and the board of the
                         bank. The end of the CAMELS rating process, when the supervisor summarizes its opinion of
                         the bank, might be an appropriate occasion to explain to the board the views and concerns
                         of the BRSA. The assessors understand that this is frequently done, but not systematically
                         with all banks. Additionally, other important analyses done by the BRSA, such as the stress
                         testing exercises could also be more clearly discussed with banks.

Principle 10             Supervisory reporting. The supervisor collects, reviews and analyses prudential reports and
                         statistical returns 21 from banks on both a solo and a consolidated basis, and independently
                         verifies these reports through either on-site examinations or use of external experts.

Essential criteria

EC1                      The supervisor has the power 22 to require banks to submit information, on both a solo and
                         a consolidated basis, on their financial condition, performance, and risks, on demand and at
                         regular intervals. These reports provide information such as on- and off-balance sheet
                         assets and liabilities, profit and loss, capital adequacy, liquidity, large exposures, risk
                         concentrations (including by economic sector, geography and currency), asset quality, loan
                         loss provisioning, related party transactions, interest rate risk, and market risk.

Description and          Articles 95 and 96 of the BL authorize the BRSA to obtain information from the institutions
findings re EC1          under the scope of the law on both a solo and consolidated basis. Banks are required to
                         provide the BRSA, timely and properly, any consolidated and non-consolidated information,
                         document, report or financial statements. The information should be provided consistently
                         with their accounts and record keeping systems, within the framework of the principles and
                         procedures set forth by the BRSB.

                         The BL also authorizes the BRSA to request any information including those classified as
                         confidential, where they are deemed necessary for the provisions of the BL, from banks and
                         their subsidiaries, from the undertakings where they hold qualified shares, from the
                         undertakings they control jointly, their branches and representative offices, their
                         outsourcing institutions and from other real and legal entities; to review their ledgers,
                         records and documents including the ones related to taxation; keep their ledgers, records
                         and documents ready for inspection; make their information systems available to the expert
                         staff of the BRSA responsible for on-site supervision; ensure the security of their data; and
                         submit all the ledgers, records and statements that they have to keep as well as the
                         microchips, micro film, magnetic tapes, compact disks and other records for inspection.


21 In the context of this Principle, “prudential reports and statistical returns” are distinct from and in addition to

required accounting reports. The former are addressed by this Principle, and the latter are addressed in Principle 27.
22   Please refer to Principle 2.

Based on these provisions of the BL, the BRSA require banks to periodically transmit data on
solo and consolidated reports, including reports of their subsidiaries operating abroad and
their shareholders.

Banks’ reporting frequencies varies from daily to annually. The periodicity of the requested
reports is determined taking into consideration basic elements such as the information
needs on supervision activities of the bank, the importance of data in analyzing the financial
performance or risk structure of the banks, the importance or the size of the bank in the
financial system, and the product diversity of the financial institution.

The most important data reported by banks on consolidated and solo basis to the BRSA’s
database, are as follows:

Surveillance Reporting Set: includes broad range of summary and detailed information on
daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual intervals in order to monitor the
financial conditions of banks as well as their compliance with relevant regulation. The BRSA
receives on a daily basis, for example, reports on the stock volume of some major on and
off balance sheet items, details of the securities portfolio, the transaction based derivatives
details, the custody services regarding securities, and the volumes and currency type of
foreign currency transactions. The BRSA also receives some reports on weekly basis
providing information about foreign currency position, consumer loans types and volumes,
liquidity positions, details of securities kept in the banks’ accounts, including the names of
the banks and the customers, details of repo transactions. In addition to these daily and
weekly reports, monthly reports cover the largest part of the surveillance reporting set. The
main financial tables are balance sheet, income statement, and various detailed and
aggregated reports of loan portfolio, detailed information on subsidiaries, securities
issuance and shareholders, general ledger, related parties and positions with other financial
institutions.

Basel Reporting Set: includes own funds, capital adequacy, LCR and sub forms related to
different risk categories (credit, market, operational etc.). Additionally, BRSA requires banks
to prepare a detailed form named “Detailed Credit Risk Assessment Form-AKRİF” to see the
steps for risk weighted asset calculation for credit risk. Since the size of the report is too
large, banks keep it ready for on-site inspection.

Cross Border Organizations Reporting Set: includes narrow range of summary and detailed
information on quarterly intervals for cross border financial subsidiaries and off-shore
branches of banks established in Turkey (balance sheet, profit/loss, loans, financial sector
relations, derivatives, interest rates, investments in associates, capital adequacy, repo, FX
position etc.).

Banks’ Shareholders Reporting Set: includes main financial tables (balance sheet and
income statements), shareholders list and ratio of each bank shareholder, and the set
should be reported for both domestic and foreign shareholders.




                                                                                                 69
TURKEY



                  Non-Bank Financial Institutions Reporting Set: includes information, on a quarterly basis, in
                  order to monitor the financial conditions of non-bank financial institutions as well as their
                  compliance with relevant regulation.

                  External audit reports and notes to financial statements are the main sources of
                  consolidated information about asset concentrations by economic sector, geographical
                  location and currency type. The BRSA does not collect regular reports directly from non-
                  financial subsidiaries of the banks. However, semiannual consolidated reports include non-
                  financial subsidiaries and affiliates which are prepared with a wider scope in addition to
                  quarterly consolidated reports.

EC2               The supervisor provides reporting instructions that clearly describe the accounting
                  standards to be used in preparing supervisory reports. Such standards are based on
                  accounting principles and rules that are widely accepted internationally.

Description and   Based on the provisions of the BL, the RAP establishes the Turkish banking system‘s
findings re EC2   accounting practices in line with the TFRS which is issued by the POA as the Turkish
                  transposition of the IFRS. The BCP assessors were informed that the main difference
                  between the implementation of IFRS and TFRS in banks and financial institutions is in loan
                  loss provisioning standards. For loan loss provisioning Turkish banks apply REPL instead of
                  impairment requirements of TAS 39 or IAS 39. The BRSA is planning to apply IFRS 9,
                  including the impairment rules from 1 January 2017. By 2017, Turkish banks may choose to
                  implement either the REPL or amended REPL that allows the use of TFRS 9.

                  The content and format of each report that banks are required to submit to the BRSA are
                  appropriately documented in template files and instructions manual. Instructions for
                  supervisory reporting and public disclosure of financial statements clearly demand the use
                  of the TFRS.

EC3               The supervisor requires banks to have sound governance structures and control processes
                  for methodologies that produce valuations. The measurement of fair values maximizes the
                  use of relevant and reliable inputs and is consistently applied for risk management and
                  reporting purposes. The valuation framework and control procedures are subject to
                  adequate independent validation and verification, either internally or by an external expert.
                  The supervisor assesses whether the valuation used for regulatory purposes is reliable and
                  prudent. Where the supervisor determines that valuations are not sufficiently prudent, the
                  supervisor requires the bank to make adjustments to its reporting for capital adequacy or
                  regulatory reporting purposes.

Description and   As described in EC2, Turkish banks apply TFRS that are a transposition of IFRS. Valuation
findings re EC3   procedures also follow TFRS.

                  The BRSA provides banks further guidance on valuation methodologies on “Guideline On
                  Fair Value Measurement” (GFVM). The guidelines require banks to maintain a broad set of
                  practices compatible with international practices on governance, internal controls,
                  independent validation, use of data, determination of valuation adjustments, dealing with
                  uncertainties of the valuation process and consistent use of the results. In addition to this,

                  there is a section specific to financial instrument fair value practices at Guideline on The
                  Assessment Criteria Considered in the Audits to be Performed by the Agency (GAA).

                  Supervisory procedures established in the GAR include the assessment of the valuation
                  process. The assessment includes the adequacy of information and documentation, the
                  appropriateness of the banks’ management governance on the valuation process, including
                  the understanding of the methodologies and deficiencies in the process.

                  During inspections, if the team determines that valuations are not sufficiently prudent, the
                  bank is instructed to make necessary adjustments to its regulatory reporting based on
                  Article 37(3) of BL and Article 31(2) of Regulation on Measurement and Assessment of
                  Capital Adequacy of Banks (RCA). Additionally, according to Article 12(1) of the Regulation
                  on the Principles regarding the Authorization and Activities of Valuation Firms (RAAVF), the
                  BRSA is authorized to require the bank to verify its valuation framework by an independent
                  valuation firm, where it is deemed necessary.

EC4               The supervisor collects and analyses information from banks at a frequency commensurate
                  with the nature of the information requested, and the risk profile and systemic importance
                  of the bank.

Description and   Based on the provisions of the BL, the BRSA requests, collects and analyses several
findings re EC4   information reports. As explained in EC1, reporting frequencies varies from daily to
                  annually. The frequency of the requested reports is determined taking into consideration
                  basic elements such as the nature of the information, the information needs on supervision
                  activities of the bank, the importance of data in analyzing the financial performance or risk
                  structure of the banks and the product diversity of the financial institution.

                  The report frequencies stipulated in the regulation do not differ among banks, except from
                  reports related to the type of bank. However, the analysis of information differs depending
                  on general market conditions, the individual condition of the bank, risk profile and size of
                  the bank. As way of example, while normal frequency for off-site financial condition report
                  is on a quarterly basis, in case of a market turbulence or existence of a problem related to
                  the financial condition of a specific bank, off-site reports can be prepared on a daily basis.

                  In addition to periodic reporting and analyzing, on demand reporting and monitoring can
                  also be intensified in case of institution specific or sector wide risks. Authorities mentioned
                  that during the political crisis between Turkey and Russian Federation in the last quarter of
                  2015, some banks were required to submit detailed risk assessments about their Russia
                  related country risks and the recent financial condition of their financial subsidiaries in
                  Russia. An off-site supervision report called “Turkish Banking Sector-Russia Risks” was also
                  prepared in order to see the extent of country risk.

EC5               In order to make meaningful comparisons between banks and banking groups, the
                  supervisor collects data from all banks and all relevant entities covered by consolidated
                  supervision on a comparable basis and related to the same dates (stock data) and periods
                  (flow data).

                         frequency.

EC6                      The supervisor has the power to request and receive any relevant information from banks,
                         as well as any entities in the wider group, irrespective of their activities, where the
                         supervisor believes that it is material to the condition of the bank or banking group, or to
                         the assessment of the risks of the bank or banking group or is needed to support resolution
                         planning. This includes internal management information.

Description and          As described in EC1, the BL provides the BRSA the power to obtain information from the
findings re EC6          institutions under the scope of the BL on both a solo and consolidated basis, including
                         those classified as confidential, where they are deemed necessary to fulfill its mandate.

                         This access to information include banks and their subsidiaries, the undertakings where they
                         hold qualified shares, the undertakings they control jointly, their branches and
                         representative offices, their outsourcing institutions and from other real and legal entities.
                         Most supervisory reports are required on both solo and consolidated versions and
                         compiled on the same date, providing comparable information for analysis.

EC7                      The supervisor has the power to access 23 all bank records for the furtherance of supervisory
                         work. The supervisor also has similar access to the bank’s Board, management and staff,
                         when required.

Description and          The BRSA has a full and wide access to records about the institutions under its supervision
findings re EC7          pursuant to Articles 95 and 96 of the BL (see EC 1 and 6 for details).

                         Access to banks’ staff is also facilitated in practice by the on-going presence of the BRSA
                         within individual institutions. Please refer also to CP9.

EC8                      The supervisor has a means of enforcing compliance with the requirement that the
                         information be submitted on a timely and accurate basis. The supervisor determines the
                         appropriate level of the bank’s senior management is responsible for the accuracy of
                         supervisory returns, imposes sanctions for misreporting and persistent errors, and requires
                         that inaccurate information be amended.

Description and          Article 39 of the BL addresses the responsibility for the accuracy of supervisory returns. The
findings re EC8          requested financial reports prepared by banks shall be signed, with names, surnames and
                         titles indicated, by the chairman of the board of directors, the members of the audit
                         committee, general manager, deputy general manager responsible for financial reporting as
                         well as the relevant unit manager or equivalent authorities. They must declare that the
                         financial report is in compliance with the legislation pertaining to financial reporting and
                         with the accounting records. The signing responsibility shall be fulfilled by the members of
                         the board of branches in Turkey of banks established abroad.

                       Pursuant to Article 146 of the BL, the BRSA is authorized to impose administrative fines
                       from 5,000 TL to 15,000 TL 24 in cases of failure to submit the information requested by the
                       BRSA, from 5,000 TL to 10,000 TL in case of late submission of such information, and from
                       5,000 TL to 15,000 TL in case of missing information, control errors or recurring control
                       errors. Late and non submitted reports are detected by the electronic data transfer system,
                       while erroneous information is checked using cross controls.

                       The Communiqué on the Principles and Procedures for the Administrative Fines to be
                       Imposed on Reportings Made Within the Scope of Banking Data Transfer System (CAFBDTS)
                       explains how and when administrative fines are applied. The BRSA has applied
                       administrative fines to banks breaching the regulation several times.

EC9                    The supervisor utilizes policies and procedures to determine the validity and integrity of
                       supervisory information. This includes a program for the periodic verification of supervisory
                       returns by means either of the supervisor’s own staff or of external experts. 25

Description and        BRSA receives most periodic reports via electronic data transfer system and automatic
findings re EC9        controls procedures are applied to each received report. These controls consist of formal,
                       logical and mathematical checks within and cross different forms. After passing through
                       intra form controls successfully and reaching the BRSA’s database, reports are subject to
                       cross controls and, if there are no reporting errors, the system sends a confirmation
                       message to the sender of the data informing on the successful transfer of the data. If the
                       system detects errors, banks are required to correct them.

                       The BRSA also perform special inspections that aim to guarantee the quality of the data
                       provided by banks. Additionally, if errors are found during off-site and on-site inspections,
                       banks are instructed to correct them immediately. Banks reporting erroneous information
                       are also subject to administrative fines.

EC10                   The supervisor clearly defines and documents the roles and responsibilities of external
                       experts, 26 including the scope of the work, when they are appointed to conduct supervisory
                       tasks. The supervisor assesses the suitability of experts for the designated task(s) and the
                       quality of the work and takes into consideration conflicts of interest that could influence the
                       output/recommendations by external experts. External experts may be utilized for routine
                       validation or to examine specific aspects of banks’ operations.

Description and        See also CP9. Article 95 of the BL allows the BRSA to supplement its audits by external
findings re EC10       experts. The Chairman has the authority to commission external audit firms to examine
                       specific matters that require expertise where it is deemed necessary. This can either be an
                       expansion of the normal audit, or a special audit. The work is commissioned by the BRSA

26 Maybe external auditors or other qualified external parties, commissioned with an appropriate mandate, and

is ultimately the supervisor that must be satisfied with the results of the reviews conducted by such external experts.

                   but paid for by the bank. The auditors of external audit firms bear the powers restricted
                   only to audit-related matters, and shall be subject to the obligation of keeping the
                   confidentiality of information and documents conveyed by the BL.

                   According to Article 33 of the BL, among the audit firms authorized by POA, BRSA has the
                   authority to set additional criteria for the firms that will perform external audits on banks.
                   REAB sets the additional criteria for firms that will audit banks’ financial reports. The audit
                   firms which meet the additional criteria are licensed by the BRSA and the list of the licensed
                   firms are disclosed to the public in BRSA website. The regulation also defines the scope of
                   the external audit as well as the roles and responsibilities of external audit firms. If, as a
                   result of supervision, it is determined that the audit firm does not comply with the
                   regulation, the license of the firm is revoked by BRSA. According to the same regulation,
                   external audit firms may conduct special audit activities, upon the request by the BRSA
                   pursuant to Article 95 of the BL mentioned above. The external audit firms that may
                   conduct information systems audit are also licensed by BRSA. Please also refer to CP9, EC11.

EC11               The supervisor requires that external experts bring to its attention promptly any material
                   shortcomings identified during the course of any work undertaken by them for supervisory
                   purposes.

Description and    Article 33 of BL and article 17 of the REAB requires external auditors to promptly inform the
findings re EC11   BRSA of any material shortcomings identified during the course of their work.

EC12               The supervisor has a process in place to periodically review the information collected to
                   determine that it satisfies a supervisory need.

Description and    The BRSA periodically reviews the information collected, but the process could be better
findings re EC12   structured. Coordination within the BRSA generally occurs through receiving a new report
                   or a new data set due to additional informational needs. As a result, data sets in the
                   database are subject to frequent updates. Any data or report can be ended due to the
                   cease of supervisory needs for the data or due to the fact that a more detailed information
                   is already been collected.

                   The BRSA also makes an effort to catch and follow new product types or to analyze their
                   effects to the financial conditions of the banks. As an example, authorities mentioned the
                   derivative transactions form as one of the most updated forms recently.

Assessment re      Compliant
Principle 10

Comments           The regulatory framework requires banks and controlling companies to periodically submit
                   a broad range of information. Regulatory and supervisory processes exist to ensure
                   accuracy and comparability of submitted returns. Developed procedures for analyzing
                   collected information and feeding into supervisory activities are in place.

                   Going forward the BRSA could consider formalizing the review of the information collected,
                   to determine that it remains appropriate and satisfies its needs.

Principle 11         Corrective and sanctioning powers of supervisors. The supervisor acts at an early stage
                     to address unsafe and unsound practices or activities that could pose risks to banks or to
                     the banking system. The supervisor has at its disposal an adequate range of supervisory
                     tools to bring about timely corrective actions. This includes the ability to revoke the banking
                     license or to recommend its revocation.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The supervisor raises supervisory concerns with the bank’s management or, where
                     appropriate, the bank’s Board, at an early stage, and requires that these concerns be
                     addressed in a timely manner. Where the supervisor requires the bank to take significant
                     corrective actions, these are addressed in a written document to the bank’s Board. The
                     supervisor requires the bank to submit regular written progress reports and checks that
                     corrective actions are completed satisfactorily. The supervisor follows through conclusively
                     and in a timely manner on matters that are identified.

Description and      The BRSA maintains a constant communication between inspection teams and the
findings re EC1      representatives of the different levels of the bank. According to supervision manuals,
                     inspection teams are expected to communicate their findings to bank’s top management,
                     audit committee members and some of the directors before finalizing their report during
                     special inspections, CAMELS rating or risk assessment. Additionally, the BRSA sends an
                     official letter after inspection reports are finalized.

                     As discussed in CP1 and EC2 bellow, the BRSA has broad powers to determine corrective
                     and remedial actions. In these situations, supervisory determinations are addressed to the
                     banks’ board in a written document. Banks are expected to respond preparing a
                     rehabilitation plan within a time period and a framework determined by the BRSA. Finally,
                     the bank should submit regular written progress reports that are used to monitor if the
                     remedial actions were implemented satisfactorily.

                     Nevertheless, the review of supervisory files, including feedback and corrective actions, as
                     well as discussion with banks by the assessors have not provided evidence of a supervisory
                     approach that raises concerns at an early stage to enable them to be addressed, particular
                     on issues that are more dependent of supervisory judgment. The assessors could see
                     several examples of letters requiring banks to make adjustments but the scope of the letters
                     were mostly limited to specific issues that were in out of line with the regulation. Actions
                     addressing more broad supervisory concerns about banks’ financial soundness or unsafe
                     practices at an early stage were not observed. Asked about feedback from supervisors,
                     banks mentioned the result of the CAMELS rating as important information but they were
                     unable to point to criticisms made by supervisors arising out of the process.

                     The supervisory review process within the BRSA also seems to play a role that limits the
                     issues that supervisors raise with banks. On-site supervisory reports are subject to a number
                     of reviews within the audit department and the enforcement department. Although reviews
                     of supervisory reports are necessary, the current process seems long and relatively skewed
                     towards checking compliance rather than supporting supervisory judgements and actions.



                                                                                                                75

                         Supervisors are much more likely to be questioned and challenged when suggesting a
                         corrective measure than when they do not raise concerns. Consideration could also be
                         given to integration of supervision and enforcement which might support a more risk
                         focused and less compliance based supervisory approach.

EC2                      The supervisor has available 27 an appropriate range of supervisory tools for use when, in the
                         supervisor’s judgment, a bank is not complying with laws, regulations or supervisory
                         actions, is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or in activities that could pose risks to
                         the bank or the banking system, or when the interests of depositors are otherwise
                         threatened.

Description and          The BRSA has available an appropriate range of supervisory tools for use when, in the
findings re EC2          supervisor’s judgment, a bank is not complying with laws, regulations or supervisory
                         decisions, or is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices. These tools include the ability to
                         require a bank to take prompt remedial action (Article 68, 69, 70 of BL) and to impose
                         administrative fines (Article 146-148 of BL).

                         As described in CP1, the situations defined in the BL when the BRSA can take corrective
                         actions are broad and allow for early measures. The bank subject to remedial and corrective
                         actions, should prepare a rehabilitation plan within the framework determined by the BRSA.
                         The bank should submit regular written progress reports that are used to monitor if the
                         remedial actions were implemented satisfactorily.

                         In practice the remedial and corrective actions provided for in the law are rarely used.
                         During the last five years there was just one case. The BRSA seems to rely more heavily on
                         administrative fines whose scope of application is more clearly defined in the BL.

EC3                      The supervisor has the power to act where a bank falls below established regulatory
                         threshold requirements, including prescribed regulatory ratios or measurements. The
                         supervisor also has the power to intervene at an early stage to require a bank to take action
                         to prevent it from reaching its regulatory threshold requirements. The supervisor has a
                         range of options to address such scenarios.

Description and          According to Article 67 of the BL, the corrective measures laid down in the BL Articles 68, 69
findings re EC3          and 70 shall be taken promptly against the relevant bank if, as a result of consolidated or
                         non-consolidated supervision, it is determined that:

                         a)   Its assets are likely not to meet its obligations in terms of maturity or that the bank
                              does not comply with the provisions pertaining to liquidity,
                         b)   Its profitability is not at level that is sufficient to reliably perform its activities, due to
                              impaired balance and relations between revenues and expenses,
                         c)   Its own funds is inadequate pursuant to the provisions pertaining to capital adequacy,
                              or such case is likely to occur,
                         d)   The quality of its assets have deteriorated in such a manner that its financial structure
                              will weaken,

                  e)   Its decisions, transactions and practices are in violation of the BL and the applicable
                       regulations,
                  f)   It cannot establish its internal audit, internal control and risk management systems or
                       cannot operate these systems efficiently or there is a factor that impedes supervision.
                  g)   Due to the incompetence of the management, the risks defined in the BL and the
                       applicable legislation have increased remarkably or have concentrated in such a
                       manner that they may weaken the financial standing.

                  As explained in EC3, despite the power to act, in recent periods these measures have been
                  rarely used, although they were in the period from 1999 to 2004 when the financial system
                  went through a crisis.

EC4               The supervisor has available a broad range of possible measures to address, at an early
                  stage, such scenarios as described in essential criterion 2 above. These measures include the
                  ability to require a bank to take timely corrective action or to impose sanctions
                  expeditiously. In practice, the range of measures is applied in accordance with the gravity of
                  a situation. The supervisor provides clear prudential objectives or sets out the actions to be
                  taken, which may include restricting the current activities of the bank, imposing more
                  stringent prudential limits and requirements, withholding approval of new activities or
                  acquisitions, restricting or suspending payments to shareholders or share repurchases,
                  restricting asset transfers, barring individuals from the banking sector, replacing or
                  restricting the powers of managers, Board members or controlling owners, facilitating a
                  takeover by or merger with a healthier institution, providing for the interim management of
                  the bank, and revoking or recommending the revocation of the banking license.

Description and   As described in EC3 the range of scenarios defined in the BL for supervisory remedial
findings re EC4   actions allow measures to be taken at an early stage. The bank subject to these actions,
                  should prepare a rehabilitation plan within a framework determined by the BRSA.

                  As described in CP 1, remedial and corrective actions set by article 68, 69 and 70 of the BL
                  allow their application according to the gravity of the situation. The broad range of possible
                  actions also allows supervisors to appropriately set prudential objective and act to
                  safeguard the banking system.

                  The measures listed in article 68 of the BL includes, among other provisions, that the BRSA
                  is allowed to require banks to increase the amount of the bank’s own funds, suspend the
                  distribution of profits, increase loan loss provisions, ensure liquidity by selling off assets,
                  restrict or stop new investments and restrict payments. Additionally, according to article 71
                  of the BL, the BRSA board is authorized to revoke the operating permissions of that bank or
                  to transfer the shareholder rights except dividends, and the management and supervision
                  of the bank to the SDIF, for the purposes of transferring, selling or merging them partially
                  or fully, on condition that the loss will be deducted from the capital of the existing
                  shareholders.

EC5               The supervisor applies sanctions not only to the bank but, when and if necessary, also to
                  management and/or the Board, or individuals therein.



                                                                                                                    77

Description and   There are several provisions in the BL that allows the BRSA to impose sanctions not only to
findings re EC5   the bank but also to management and the Board.

                  Article 147 of the BL allows the BRSA to impose financial penalties against relevant persons
                  if they commit certain violations.

                  Article 69 of the BL, provides the possibility to apply sanctions to individuals. The BRSA may
                  require a bank to call on the shareholders meeting to convene extraordinarily to change
                  one or more of the members of board of directors, or to appoint new members by
                  increasing the number of board members, if the members have responsibility in the
                  decision taken, transactions made and practices applied, or to dismiss responsible
                  employees. Also, according to restrictive measures in article 70, BRSA may request a bank to
                  dismiss some or all of the general managers, deputy general managers, relevant unit and
                  branch directors including board of directors, and to get the approval of the BRSA for new
                  recruitments for the emptied positions or the seats.

                  According to the Article 110 of the BL, if it is determined that the managers and auditors of
                  a bank, or its general manager and assistant general managers, or its authorized signatory
                  officers have caused the application of the provisions of Article 71 for the bank through
                  their decisions and actions that are in violation of the applicable laws, on the basis of a
                  decision of SDIF Board and upon the request of the SDIF, such person shall be held
                  personally liable to the extent of the damage they have caused to the bank and a court may
                  declare any such person bankrupt.

                  Finally, article 26 of the BL establishes that persons who have been declared bankrupt or
                  hold control in banks that have been subjected to restrictive measures, liquidation, or
                  whose operating permissions have been revoked, cannot work at any bank as general
                  manager, deputy general manager or in a position wherein they have signing authority.
                  Additionally, the signing authority of any bank employee, who is found to have infringed
                  provisions of the BL or other applicable laws, might be temporarily revoked upon the
                  BRSB's decision. Such persons may not be employed by any bank as an employee vested
                  with signing authorities unless permitted by the BRSB.

EC6               The supervisor has the power to take corrective actions, including ring-fencing of the bank
                  from the actions of parent companies, subsidiaries, parallel-owned banking structures and
                  other related entities in matters that could impair the safety and soundness of the bank or
                  the banking system.

Description and   As described in CP1, articles 68, 69 and 70 of the BL can be used to implement wide ranging
findings re EC6   corrective actions on banks and controlling companies. For example, these powers could be
                  used to restrict the subsidiary’s dividend payment to its controlling company, the subsidiary
                  exposure to the controlling company or to its related entities, or the controlling company’s
                  exercise of its shareholder’s right over the bank.

EC7               The supervisor cooperates and collaborates with relevant authorities in deciding when and
                  how to effect the orderly resolution of a problem bank situation (which could include
                  closure, or assisting in restructuring, or merger with a stronger institution).

Description and   There is regular exchange of information between the BRSA and the SDIF that enables the
findings re EC7   SDIF to access supervisory information of individual banks. In accordance with article 100 of
                  the BL, a Coordination Committee has been established between the two institutions. This
                  Committee meets at least once every three months to further promote the exchange of
                  information and high-level cooperation between the two institutions. Furthermore, the BL
                  determines that the BRSA and the SDIF shall have access to jointly-agreed databases of each
                  other within the principles of confidentiality.

                  In addition, according to the protocol signed between the BRSA and the SDIF, the BRSA
                  notifies the SDIF that a bank has been required to take corrective, rehabilitative, or
                  restrictive measures (Articles 68, 69, and 70). The timely notification allows SDIF to develop
                  a Resolution Action Plan and prepare for the eventual process.

                  As it is explained in CP1 once the BRSA determines that the conditions for intervention are
                  met in relation to a bank, it has two options: to revoke the bank’s operating permission
                  (Article 106 of the BL) or to transfer the shareholder rights (except dividends) and its
                  management and control to the SDIF (Article 107 of the BL). In the second case, the SDIF
                  can select and implement any resolution strategy that falls within its statutory remit, and
                  cooperates with other authorities – primarily the BRSA – during the resolution process. The
                  BRSA retains its supervisory and regulatory authority over a bank in resolution under SDIF
                  management.

AC2               When taking formal corrective action in relation to a bank, the supervisor informs the

                  coordinates its actions with them.

Comments          The BRSA has available an appropriate range of supervisory tools to use when, in the
                  supervisor’s judgment, a bank is not complying with the regulations or represents a risk for
                  the financial sector. Nevertheless, in practice, the remedial and corrective actions provided



                                                                                                                79

                        for in the law are rarely used at an early stage as preventative measures. The BRSA seems to
                        rely more heavily on administrative fines whose scope of application is more clearly defined
                        in the BL than on taking actions at an early stage to address unsafe and unsound practices
                        that require supervisory judgment.

                        The assessors were presented evidence of BRSA actions requiring banks to make
                        adjustments to practices and processes. Nevertheless, such action had a scope limited to
                        specific issues such as the classification of particular loans operations. Evidence was not
                        observed of supervisors addressing broader concerns about the risks posed and faced by
                        banks from a deepening and expansion of the initial review, a point reinforced in the
                        comments of banks.

                        The supervisory review process within the BRSA also seems to play a role towards limiting
                        the issues that supervisors raise with banks. Although reviews of supervisory reports are
                        necessary, the current process seems relatively skewed towards validation of compliance
                        processes and thus constrains active supervisory judgments and decisions. Consideration
                        could also be given to integration of supervision and enforcement, particularly in terms of
                        communication with financial institutions, which might support a more risk focused and less
                        compliance based supervisory approach.

                        In order to become fully compliant with this principle the BRSA needs to incorporate the
                        results of forward looking tools more heavily in its decision making process and act at an
                        early stage to restore weak banks and correct examples of unsound practices, even if formal
                        prudential ratios haven’t been breached.

Principle 12            Consolidated supervision. An essential element of banking supervision is that the
                        supervisor supervises the banking group on a consolidated basis, adequately monitoring
                        and, as appropriate, applying prudential standards to all aspects of the business conducted
                        by the banking group worldwide. 28

Essential criteria

EC1                     The supervisor understands the overall structure of the banking group and is familiar with
                        all the material activities (including non-banking activities) conducted by entities in the
                        wider group, both domestic and cross-border. The supervisor understands and assesses
                        how group-wide risks are managed and takes action when risks arising from the banking
                        group and other entities in the wider group, in particular contagion and reputation risks,
                        may jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank and the banking system.

Description and         The BL provide powers and responsibilities for the BRSA to supervise bank groups on a
findings re EC1         consolidated basis:

                        - Article 66 states that parent banks are subject to limitations and standard ratios on a
                        consolidated basis and to consolidated supervision.

- Articles 95 and 96 of the BL, authorizes the BRSA to request all necessary documentation
and information from the parent company of a banking group as well as the entities within
the group to perform its duties. The law also allows the collection of information from
banks’ shareholder and therefore includes banks ‘parent companies even if they are not
financial companies.

- Financial holding companies are also subject to consolidated supervision pursuant to
Article 78 of the BL.

Based on the authority provided by the BL, the BRSA has issued guidance on the
preparation of consolidated financial statements of banks. The CCFS states that parent
banks are obliged to prepare consolidated financial statements quarterly considering the
financial subsidiaries of the group and semi-annually including financial and non-financial
subsidiaries. Financial subsidiaries include insurance firms. The consolidated financial
statements and reports are used for calculating regulatory ratios and limits.

The BRSA request an extensive amount of information about the group. Intra group
transactions are monitored by off-site supervisors through monthly call reports. Banks also
regularly report and update the names of all real and legal persons in their own risk group,
including their shareholders, affiliates and subsidiaries on a monthly basis. Loans extended
within the group of the own bank, transactions with related party, derivative transactions
within the own group and risk limits are the main surveillance call reports which are used
for reviewing aggregate exposures to the group of the own bank. Names of all real and
legal persons in their own risk group and related party risk limits are the main surveillance
call reports for financial holding companies.

In order to complement consolidated reports and analysis, BRSA also requests balance
sheet, income statement, loan book details (including non-performing loans), securities,
derivatives, FX position, transactions between cross-border establishments and the banking
group, capital adequacy, transactions with financial sector and deposits data on a quarterly
basis from the foreign based subsidiaries and off shore branches of the banks.

Banks are also required to submit a number of periodic reports containing information of
their parent companies, including balance sheet, shareholders list and income statements.

The BRSA updated its on-site supervision process in 2012 and all banks have been
examined with respect to the new process since then. As described in CP 8, BRSA teams
take into account the consolidated risk profile of banks. Supervision manuals (SMIRASP and
SMGAR) explicitly ask supervisory teams to understand the structure of the banking group
to which the bank belongs. Also, the ownership structure of the bank is included in
inspection reports together with the other findings.

In this context, the adequacy of their risk management, internal control and internal audit
systems, effectiveness of their internal processes and procedures and the compliance of
their operations with the relevant legislation are assessed, on a group level, by the on-site
examiners through the CAMELS rating system. Contagion and reputation risks, for instance,
are taken into account with specific questions that need to be answered by the supervisor.



                                                                                           81

                  There are also assessment criteria to address the risks that may arise from banks’ parent
                  companies, affiliates and subsidiaries.

                  Furthermore, banks are required to prepare their ICAAP reports on consolidated basis
                  according to RICAAP article 46(1). In the article 47of RICAAP, it is stated that ICAAP reports
                  comprise all the risks of the bank on consolidated basis. According to article 61 of RICAAP,
                  banks should not abide by the definition and scope of consolidation specified in the
                  legislation and the assessment should be made based on the partnership's risk profile,
                  rather than the inclusion of the partnership to the definition of consolidation specified in
                  the legislation. Furthermore, section 5 of Annex to Guideline on ICAAP Report (GICAAPR),
                  states that “In identifying their own risks, banks should also consider risks arising from the
                  parent company or subsidiaries belonging to the parent company (for example,
                  reputational risk), alongside the risks existing by themselves or arising from their
                  consolidated affiliates and subsidiaries. In doing so, they should be attentive that there are
                  no inconsistencies between the identification of risk and measurement and management
                  activities”.

                  As discussed in CPs 8 and 9, in practice, CAMELS rating assessments do not provide an
                  appropriate framework for the deep analysis of issues and the ICAAP process is still on a
                  learning phase for both banks and supervisors. That limits the ability of supervisors to fully
                  understand the overall structure and group-wide risks of the conglomerates.

                  In Turkey, as of September 2015, 19 banks have established foreign operations which
                  include 60 subsidiaries. Total assets of these cross border operations amounts to 15.7% of
                  the total assets of banking sector. In terms of total assets, the largest foreign establishments
                  are located in Malta, Bahrain and the Netherlands whereas the highest number of branches
                  and subsidiaries operate in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

EC2               The supervisor imposes prudential standards and collects and analyses financial and other
                  information on a consolidated basis for the banking group, covering areas such as capital
                  adequacy, liquidity, large exposures, and exposures to related parties, lending limits and
                  group structure.

Description and   Based on article 43 of the BL, prudential limits covering capital adequacy, liquidity, large
findings re EC2   exposures, exposures to related parties and lending limits are required to be met on both
                  solo and consolidated basis. As explained in EC1, the BRSA collects and analyses data for
                  monitoring the prudential limits and assess risks on a consolidated basis. Prudential
                  consolidated ratios such as, capital adequacy, liquidity coverage ratio, lending limits, group
                  risks, large and related party exposures, leverage ratio and FX net position are received from
                  the banks on specified intervals. Banks are also required to submit to the BRSA quarterly
                  consolidated financial statements such as balance sheet, income statement, cash flow
                  statement, share-holders equity statement and earnings distribution tables. Issues
                  associated with group structure are analyzed using monthly call reports and information
                  collected during on-site inspections.

EC3               The supervisor reviews whether the oversight of a bank’s foreign operations by
                  management (of the parent bank or head office and, where relevant, the holding company)
                  is adequate having regard to their risk profile and systemic importance and there is no
                  hindrance in host countries for the parent bank to have access to all the material
                  information from their foreign branches and subsidiaries. The supervisor also determines
                  that banks’ policies and processes require the local management of any cross-border
                  operations to have the necessary expertise to manage those operations in a safe and sound
                  manner, and in compliance with supervisory and regulatory requirements. The home
                  supervisor takes into account the effectiveness of supervision conducted in the host
                  countries in which its banks have material operations.

Description and   As explained in CP 7, banks’ cross border investments requires BRSA approval according to
findings re EC3   the BL Article 14 and RTSPIO Article 9. The BL also establishes that there should be no
                  obstacles in gathering information and executing supervision on the cross border company
                  and where necessary, the BRSA may require a MoU with the host supervisory authority.
                  Therefore, BRSA has authority to reject any cross-border investment proposal either in the
                  form of branch or subsidiary if the supervisory framework of the host country is deemed
                  insufficient or does not allow appropriate access for supervision purposes.

                  BRSA regulation requires banks to build an appropriate risk management framework that
                  comprise the whole banking conglomerate. In particular, the ICAAP report should consider
                  risk management practices in subsidiaries and the CAMELS rating system should evaluate
                  the adequacy and effectiveness of management’s oversight of bank’s foreign operations.
                  Furthermore, banks should inform the BRSA who are the board members of foreign
                  subsidiaries and the BRSA that might reject them if consider that they do not hold the
                  appropriate conditions for their functions.

                  The BRSA also conducts on-site inspections in foreign branches and subsidiaries of banks
                  once every two or three years. The effectiveness of the parent company’s oversight on the
                  foreign operations is evaluated during these visits.

                  Finally, there are specific reports submitted by banks on cross-border operations. The Cross
                  Border Organizations Reporting Set, please refer to CP9, is the main source of information
                  about the oversight of banks’ foreign operations. The reports include detailed information
                  about operations of foreign establishments of banks.

EC4               The home supervisor visits the foreign offices periodically, the location and frequency being
                  determined by the risk profile and systemic importance of the foreign operation. The
                  supervisor meets the host supervisors during these visits. The supervisor has a policy for
                  assessing whether it needs to conduct on-site examinations of a bank’s foreign operations,
                  or require additional reporting, and has the power and resources to take those steps as and
                  when appropriate.

Description and   BRSA has the power to initiate and carry out on-site inspections of foreign subsidiaries and
findings re EC4   branches of banks licensed in Turkey. On-site examiners of the BRSA perform periodic
                  inspections in subsidiaries and branches overseas. The BRSA determines the list of the



                                                                                                               83

                  subsidiaries and branches which will be subject to on-site inspection mainly according to
                  size and complexity of the operations. The frequency and timing of on-site inspections of
                  foreign establishments also depend on work load of on-site examiners and host country
                  supervisory authority’s time preferences. The issue is considered by the head of
                  departments every year during the strategic planning phase of the supervisory cycle.

                  The BRSA conducted 52 on-site visits to foreign subsidiaries and branches since 2008. These
                  visits include 19 subsidiaries, 6 off-shore branches and 27 on-shore branches of 11 banks.
                  The last time a large number of banks were visited was in 2013. Besides, upon the invitation
                  from the host authorities, the BRSA on-site inspection teams have been involved in on-site
                  inspection of subsidiaries of banks in a few jurisdictions during the last two years.

                  The BRSA has entered into MoUs with the supervisory authorities of 34 countries to
                  facilitate on-site inspections of foreign establishments of banks operating in Turkey. Among
                  the 34 MoUs concluded by the BRSA, 19 MoUs are signed with the supervisory authorities
                  of countries where Turkish banks have presence. These foreign operations represent 77% of
                  total assets of the Turkish banks operating abroad. Additional MoUs are under discussion
                  with foreign supervisory authorities.

                  Article 98 of the BL also authorizes the BRSA to cooperate with a foreign supervisory
                  authority even in the absence of an MoU. In this case, the requests of authorities of foreign
                  countries regarding the audit of Turkey branches or undertakings of institutions operating
                  in the financial markets of their own countries and to obtain information about such
                  branches and undertakings, and the requests of information covered by consolidation from
                  the overseas branches and undertakings of banks shall be subject to BRSB’s approval within
                  the framework of the principle of reciprocity. Please also refer to CP13, EC2.

EC5               The supervisor reviews the main activities of parent companies, and of companies affiliated
                  with the parent companies, that have a material impact on the safety and soundness of the
                  bank and the banking group, and takes appropriate supervisory action.

Description and   The activities of parent companies are mostly assessed through the ratings process. The
findings re EC5   methodology has a number of assessment criteria that are analyzed by on-site supervisors.
                  Nevertheless, as discussed in CP8, the methodology is not designed to provide an in-depth
                  evaluation of all the criteria.

                  The BRSA also requires banks to prepare reports on intra-group transactions on a yearly
                  basis since 2014. Intra-group transaction reports include:

                  -        Transactions between the bank and its financial and non-financial subsidiaries
                  (controlled directly or indirectly by the bank)

                  -        Transactions between the bank’s financial and non-financial subsidiaries (controlled
                  directly by the bank)

                  -        Transactions between parent company and the bank together with its financial
                  subsidiaries (controlled directly or indirectly by the bank)

                        -         Transactions between the bank with its financial subsidiaries and companies
                        controlled directly or indirectly by parent company.

                        The transactions include financial (securities, loans and participation investments) and non-
                        financial transactions (trading, property related transactions, leasing, technical services,
                        consulting services etc.). Information on intra-group transaction reports is an input for BRSA
                        examiners in the rating process.

EC6                     The supervisor limits the range of activities the consolidated group may conduct and the
                        locations in which activities can be conducted (including the closing of foreign offices) if it
                        determines that:

                        a)   the safety and soundness of the bank and banking group is compromised because the
                             activities expose the bank or banking group to excessive risk and/or are not properly
                             managed;
                        b)   the supervision by other supervisors is not adequate relative to the risks the activities
                             present; and/or
                        c)   the exercise of effective supervision on a consolidated basis is hindered.

Description and         As explained in CP 1, article 67 of the BL allows the BRSA to impose restrictive measures on
findings re EC6         banks in a number of situations that include impediments to supervision and inadequate
                        risk management. Among these restrictive measures, article 70 of the BL authorizes the
                        BRSA to require the bank to restrict or temporarily suspend its activities, as inclusive of all
                        the organization of the relevant activity, or the domestic or overseas branches to be
                        deemed necessary or the relations with correspondent banks.

                        Furthermore, according to article 78 of BL, financial holding companies are also subject to
                        article 70. Therefore, if a bank or a financial holding company is a parent company of a bank
                        or part of a banking group, BRSA has power to restrict or temporarily suspend their
                        activities.

EC7                     In addition to supervising on a consolidated basis, the responsible supervisor supervises
                        individual banks in the group. The responsible supervisor supervises each bank on a stand-
                        alone basis and understands its relationship with other members of the group. 29

Description and         According to article 95 of BL, BRSA is responsible for the supervision of institutions under
findings re EC7         the scope of the law both on a consolidated and individual basis.

                        The supervisory perspective of the BRSA analyses individual banks and risks that other
                        entities of the group might impose on them. The BL and all the other applicable regulations
                        put the individual banks (the statement “bank”) at the center of the regulatory and
                        supervisory framework. As explained on CPs 8 and 9, data is also collected and analyzed on
                        individual basis and the impact of the individual bank’s relationships with the other
                        members of the group on the safety, soundness and reputation of the bank is assessed in

Assessment of        Largely Compliant
Principle 12

Comments             The regulatory and reporting framework provides a broadly appropriate structure for
                     monitoring and assessing risks to banks from non-banking and foreign banking operations
                     in banking groups. However, the current limitations of the CAMELS rating and ICAAP
                     process, the BRSA should make further effort to monitor and manage risks arising from
                     nonbanking and foreign activities or parent entities of a financial group. In this regard, as
                     described in CP 8 and 9, the BRSA should deepen the analyses and strengthen its
                     techniques, such as group-wide stress testing, to monitor and assess these risks. It is
                     important to improve further the group-wide strategic view of the banking group
                     operations and risks. Authorities should further improve the recovery and resolution
                     planning of large banking groups particularly once the necessary power is given to the
                     supervisor by the expected new legislation. Such planning should also consider scenarios
                     where shocks originate from non-banking entities or parent groups. Taking into account
                     that these shortcomings have already been reflected in other principles, particularly CP 8
                     and 9, the assessors considered this principle compliant.

Principle 13         Home-host relationships. Home and host supervisors of cross-border banking groups
                     share information and cooperate for effective supervision of the group and group entities,
                     and effective handling of crisis situations. Supervisors require the local operations of foreign
                     banks to be conducted to the same standards as those required of domestic banks.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The home supervisor establishes bank-specific supervisory colleges for banking groups with
                     material cross-border operations to enhance its effective oversight, taking into account the
                     risk profile and systemic importance of the banking group and the corresponding needs of
                     its supervisors. In its broadest sense, the host supervisor who has a relevant subsidiary or a
                     significant branch in its jurisdiction and who, therefore, has a shared interest in the effective
                     supervisory oversight of the banking group, is included in the college. The structure of the
                     college reflects the nature of the banking group and the needs of its supervisors.

Description and     As of September 2015, 19 Turkish banks had foreign subsidiaries or branches operating in
findings re EC1     28 different countries. At least 5 of these have more than 15% of their assets abroad and at
                    least two of them have more than 40%.

                    The BRSA has organized early this year a supervisory college for one of the largest Turkish
                    banks that maintain substantial operations abroad. The college was the first one organized
                    by the BRSA in its capacity as home supervisor. Host authorities from the 6 countries where
                    the bank maintains operations were invited. Representatives of the BRSA presented
                    information on the current situation of the banking sector of Turkey and the BRSA’s
                    approaches to banking regulation and supervision. There was also exchange of information
                    among home and host supervisors about the operations, strength and weakness of the
                    particular bank. Host and home supervisors considered the event important for the
                    consolidated supervision of the bank.

                    There are other banks in Turkey with extensive operations abroad that would benefit from
                    colleges. The BRSA explained that it plans to organize other colleges in the future.

EC2                 Home and host supervisors share appropriate information on a timely basis in line with
                    their respective roles and responsibilities, both bilaterally and through colleges. This
                    includes information both on the material risks and risk management practices of the
                    banking group 30 and on the supervisors’ assessments of the safety and soundness of the
                    relevant entity under their jurisdiction. Informal or formal arrangements (such as
                    memoranda of understanding) are in place to enable the exchange of confidential
                    information.

Description and     According to the article 98 of the BL, the BRSA is authorized to cooperate and exchange
findings re EC2     information about financial institutions and financial markets with competent supervisory
                    authorities, within the framework of bilateral memoranda of understanding or through
                    other means, in order to conduct inspections in foreign countries, provide training and
                    ensure exchange of personnel with the purpose of the harmonization of policies and
                    legislation.

                    The MoUs signed by the BRSA specify general principles and procedures concerning the
                    cooperation within the statutory legislation. They contain provisions about the exchange of
                    information that includes providing relevant information to the counterparty authority
                    regarding: i) material developments or supervisory concerns in respect of cross-border
                    establishments; ii) events which have the potential to endanger the stability of the cross-
                    border establishments; iii) material enforcement actions taken against the cross-border
                    establishment; and iv) cases of revocation of the license and operating permission or
                    voluntary liquidation.

                    The BRSA has entered into MoU with the supervisory authorities of 34 countries. Among the
                    34 MoUs concluded by the BRSA, 19 MoUs are signed with the supervisory authorities of

                  countries where Turkish banks have presence. These foreign subsidiaries hold 77% of total
                  assets of the Turkish banks operating abroad. Besides, MoU negotiations are continuing
                  with six countries other countries where Turkish banks are operating. Difficulties that
                  occurred in the past for supervision in a specific country have been overcome.

                  The BRSA explained that currently the agency does not face any problems to supervise
                  cross border subsidiaries or exchange information with home supervisors.

                  Furthermore, the BRSA is legally authorized to cooperate with a foreign supervisory
                  authority even in the absence of a specific agreement. Pursuant to Article 98 of the BL, if a
                  MoU is not effective, the requests of authorities of foreign countries, which have been
                  authorized for supervision pursuant to their respective laws and which are equivalent to the
                  BRSA, to examine the Turkish branches or undertakings of institutions operating in the
                  financial markets of their own countries and to obtain information about such branches and
                  undertakings, and the requests of information covered by consolidation from the overseas
                  branches and undertakings of banks shall be fulfilled within the framework of the principle
                  of reciprocity and is subject to the permission of the BRSB.

                  Finally, as a host supervisor of 32 banks the BRSA has participated in supervisory colleges
                  arranged by several countries and organized a college for one of Turkish banks with one of
                  the largest operations abroad.

EC3               Home and host supervisors coordinate and plan supervisory activities or undertake
                  collaborative work if common areas of interest are identified in order to improve the
                  effectiveness and efficiency of supervision of cross-border banking groups.

Description and   As explained in EC1 and EC2 the BRSA maintains MoUs with other relevant supervisory
findings re EC3   authorities and participates in supervisory colleges.

                  In order to improve the efficiency of the consolidated supervision, the BRSA has conducted
                  on-site inspections of foreign subsidiaries and branches of Turkish banks operating in a
                  number of countries. Additionally, upon the invitation from host authorities, the BRSA on-
                  site inspection teams have participated in inspections of Turkish banks operating abroad.

                  The BRSA provides feedback to the host authority on the issues found by the examiners
                  during the on-site inspection of the cross border establishment providing a summary of the
                  inspection report. In the case of on-site visits, communication is updated through opening
                  and closing meetings held between the BRSA examiners and the host supervisory authority.
                  The BRSA also approves meeting requests of equivalent supervisory authorities concerning
                  the cross border establishments operating in Turkey. Similarly, the BRSA organizes meetings
                  with the auditors of foreign supervisory authorities who perform on-site visit to the Turkish
                  subsidiaries of foreign banks. Any findings that might have an impact on the safety and
                  soundness or the risk management capabilities of the banking group are also shared with
                  the relevant host authority within the scope of MoUs concluded.

                  The BRSA also explained that it exchanges appropriate information with foreign supervisory
                  authorities in line with the provisions of the BL regarding the financial situation of banks,

EC4               The home supervisor develops an agreed communication strategy with the relevant host
                  supervisors. The scope and nature of the strategy reflects the risk profile and systemic
                  importance of the cross-border operations of the bank or banking group. Home and host
                  supervisors also agree on the communication of views and outcomes of joint activities and
                  college meetings to banks, where appropriate, to ensure consistency of messages on
                  group-wide issues.

Description and   As mentioned above, the BRSA is empowered to exchange information with other relevant
findings re EC4   supervisors and maintain a number of MoU setting the principles for the communication.
                  Colleges and on-site inspections are also part of the strategy.

EC5               Where appropriate, due to the bank’s risk profile and systemic importance, the home
                  supervisor, working with its national resolution authorities, develops a framework for cross-
                  border crisis cooperation and coordination among the relevant home and host authorities.
                  The relevant authorities share information on crisis preparations from an early stage in a
                  way that does not materially compromise the prospect of a successful resolution and
                  subject to the application of rules on confidentiality.

Description and   Since Turkey is not a home country or a key-host country for G-SIBs, the BRSA and SDIF,
findings re EC5   although available, have not been participating in crisis management groups of these
                  institutions.

                  Turkish supervisory authorities have not initiated the development of a framework for
                  cross-border crisis cooperation and coordination. As mentioned in EC1, some Turkish banks
                  present material cross border operations and could benefit from such framework.

EC6               Where appropriate, due to the bank’s risk profile and systemic importance, the home
                  supervisor, working with its national resolution authorities and relevant host authorities,
                  develops a group resolution plan. The relevant authorities share any information necessary
                  for the development and maintenance of a credible resolution plan. Supervisors also alert
                  and consult relevant authorities and supervisors (both home and host) promptly when
                  taking any recovery and resolution measures.

Description and   As mentioned in CP 8, Turkish supervisory authorities have not initiated the development of
findings re EC6   group resolution plans. The BRSA and the SDIF have established a joint working group to
                  analyze the eventual need to change the current resolution regime and align it with FSB’s
                  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes. The joint working group is still formulating
                  policy proposals and necessary legislative amendments. Banks have not been required yet
                  to develop recovery plans and supervisors do not assess the resolvability of banking
                  groups.

EC7               The host supervisor’s national laws or regulations require that the cross-border operations
                  of foreign banks are subject to prudential, inspection and regulatory reporting
                  requirements similar to those for domestic banks.



                                                                                                                89

Description and    Pursuant to the legislation, subsidiaries or branches of foreign banks operating in Turkey
findings re EC7    are subject to the same prudential, supervisory and regulatory reporting requirements
                   applied to domestic banks.

EC8                The home supervisor is given on-site access to local offices and subsidiaries of a banking
                   group in order to facilitate their assessment of the group’s safety and soundness and
                   compliance with customer due diligence requirements. The home supervisor informs host
                   supervisors of intended visits to local offices and subsidiaries of banking groups.

Description and    According to the Article 98 of the BL, foreign authorities which have been authorized for
findings re EC8    supervision under their respective laws and which are equivalent to the BRSA, need to
                   request permission to examine the Turkish branches or undertakings of institutions
                   operating in the financial markets of their own countries. These permissions and requests of
                   information covered by consolidation from the overseas branches and undertakings of
                   banks are fulfilled within the principle of reciprocity and are subject to the permission of the
                   BRSB.

                   In this context, home supervisors may carry out on-site examination in Turkey subject to
                   prior notification to the BRSA. If there is a MoU in place, the request regarding the on-site
                   inspection is evaluated considering the provisions of the MoU. If there is not a MoU, the on-
                   site visit request is submitted to the BRSB for approval.

                   The BRSA explained that all the inspection requests of home supervisory authorities of
                   foreign banks operating in Turkey have been accepted by the BRSA. A number of
                   jurisdictions have performed on site visits to cross border establishments of financial
                   institutions operating in the financial markets of their own countries. As mentioned in EC 3,
                   overseas subsidiaries and branches of Turkish banks are also subject to on-site inspection.
                   BRSA has conducted 39 on-site visits to foreign subsidiaries and branches of banks
                   operating in Turkey since 2011. These visits include 20 subsidiaries and 16 branches
                   operating in 13 countries.

EC9                The host supervisor supervises booking offices in a manner consistent with internationally
                   agreed standards. The supervisor does not permit shell banks or the continued operation of
                   shell banks.

Description and    The BRSA does not permit shell banks or booking offices.

                   Furthermore, Article 6 (4) of the BL stipulates that representative offices of the foreign
                   banks are not allowed to do any banking business. CAROT regulates the activities of
                   representative offices of foreign banks.

EC10               A supervisor that takes consequential action on the basis of information received from
                   another supervisor consults with that supervisor, to the extent possible, before taking such
                   action.

Description and    As explained in EC1, 2 and 3 above, the BRSA works in contact with other supervisors
findings re EC10   through various channels. MoUs signed by the BRSA includes provisions that authorities
                   should inform each other of any material developments and formal enforcement action

                        authorities, the BRSA may consult with the other supervisory authorities.

Assessment of           Largely Compliant
Principle 13

Comments                The BRSA has made vast efforts to improve home-host relationship during the last few
                        years. Among several initiatives the agency has started organizing colleges, signed a
                        number of important MoUs and removed obstacles that weakened the supervision of
                        Turkish banks operations in several countries. Nevertheless, considering that some Turkish
                        banks hold material operations abroad, it is important to improve the relationship even
                        further. In particular, it is essential to develop a framework for cross-border crisis
                        coordination with relevant host authorities and the development of resolution plans that
                        pay special attention to cross border issues.

B. Prudential Regulations and Requirements

Principle 14            Corporate governance. The supervisor determines that banks and banking groups have
                        robust corporate governance policies and processes covering, for example, strategic
                        direction, group and organizational structure, control environment, responsibilities of the
                        banks’ Boards and senior management, 31 and compensation. These policies and processes
                        are commensurate with the risk profile and systemic importance of the bank.

Essential criteria

EC1                     Laws, regulations or the supervisor establish the responsibilities of a bank’s Board and
                        senior management with respect to corporate governance to ensure there is effective
                        control over the bank’s entire business. The supervisor provides guidance to banks and
                        banking groups on expectations for sound corporate governance.

Description and         Corporate governance features prominently in Turkish banking legislation. The legal and
findings re EC1         regulatory framework surrounding corporate governance resides in several key laws and is
                        comprehensive. BL Article 1 establishes corporate governance as a part of ensuring
                        confidence and stability in financial markets, the efficient functioning of the credit system
                        and the protection of the rights and interests of depositors. It establishes that shareholders’
                        interests are secondary to the depositors’ interests for banks, and is generally aligned with
                        Basel guidance and principles for corporate governance.

                        The BL, 3rd part, explicitly addresses corporate governance. This part regulates the allocation
                        of authority, qualifications and responsibilities of management, internal systems, authorized
                        institutions and financial reporting. Related to these titles a number of sub-regulations, of
                        which the most important are RICAAP and Regulation on the Corporate Governance
                        Principles of Banks (RCGB), have been designed in order to implement the principles and
                        enumerate responsibilities on corporate governance.

         The responsibilities and authorities of the banks’ board is regulated in the Article 23 of BL.
         According to Article 23(3) the responsibilities of the board of directors shall include
         ensuring the establishment, functionality, appropriateness and adequacy of internal control,
         risk management and internal audit systems compliant with the applicable legislation;
         securing financial reporting systems; and specification of the powers and responsibilities
         within the bank.

         Under the BL Article 23, the board of directors shall have at least 5 members including the
         general manager. The qualifications of a majority of members shall have similar
         qualifications as the general manager. The positions of chairman of the board and general
         manager (or chief executive officer) must be separate. The BRSA must be informed about
         (and approve) the appointment of the members. However, the BL nor subsidiary legislation
         requires the majority of the board to be non-executive and collectively act independently
         and objectively from the influence of other parties.

         Article 24 goes on to direct that the board must appoint an audit committee of at least 2
         board members. These 2 members shall not have executive functions within the bank.
         (RICAAP Article 6 goes on to define “non-executive” members which is very similar to the
         definition of independent given in the CMB’s Communique.)

         While some bank boards in the system have populated this committee with more members,
         a minimum of 2 members is considered too few in order to execute the duties assigned to it
         in a robust and effective manner. In addition, the chair of this committee, in some banks is
         also the chairman of the board which does not reflect best practice and potentially
         represents a conflict of interest.

         The duties and responsibilities of the audit committee include the supervision of the
         efficiency and adequacy of the bank’s internal control, risk management and internal audit
         systems and the accounting and reporting systems within the framework of BL. The audit
         committee shall also be responsible for ensuring that internal systems units and the
         external audit firms regularly provide reports regarding the execution of their tasks.

         Given that the audit committee is responsible for the oversight of internal systems in which
         risk management is a part, many banks’ audit committees also fill the role of a board risk
         committee that would, in other circumstances be separate from the audit committee. The
         team was informed that in the more complex banks, there is, in fact, a separate risk
         committee.

         RICAAP enumerates major provisions assigning responsibility to the board and senior
         management for establishing and monitoring of the internal systems. The term “internal
         system" includes internal audit, internal control and risk management systems. Article 5(1)
         of RICAAP provides that members of the board of directors are ultimately responsible for
         establishment and effective operation of the internal systems. They are also responsible for
         defining the powers and duties within the bank regarding these systems. Article 5(2) defines
         the responsibilities of the board in detail by mentioning the board’s overall responsibilities
         on determining the structure of the whole organization, human resources policies, senior

                      management selection policies, and also with reference to the internal system’s structure,
                      organization and policies, strategic policies, risk management and consumer complaints
                      from conduct of business.

                      Article 7 of RICAAP sets forth in more detail the duties of the audit committee which must
                      act in the name of the board of directors. The committee must supervise efficiency and
                      adequacy of the internal systems. In this manner, the audit committee must supervise
                      compliance with the provisions of RICAAP concerning internal control, internal audit and
                      risk management and with the internal policies and implementation procedures approved
                      by the board of directors and to make proposals to the board of directors in relation to
                      measures which it is considered necessary to take. Furthermore Article 7(2) gives the details
                      of these responsibilities such as: the establishment of communication channels in the bank;
                      assessment of the adequacy of the internal systems; internal systems staff and
                      management; establishment of whistle-blowing channels; evaluation of internal audit plans
                      and follow up; evaluation of the adequacy of internal system staff, risk management tools,
                      and infrastructure; the contact with internal and external auditors; monitoring of the
                      financial reporting system; evaluation of outsourced activities.

                      Duties and responsibilities of the senior management are also regulated under RICAAP as
                      well as in the Regulation on Corporate Management Principles of Banks (RCGB). According
                      to Article 8, the senior management must fulfill their responsibilities to carry out their
                      assigned responsibilities and ensure they do so efficiently. They must also report the board
                      of directors about material risks to which the bank is exposed.

                      CMB also has its Communiqué on Corporate Governance 32 (Communiqué) applicable to
                      listed companies. According to the paragraph 4 of Annex 1 of the Communiqué, the board
                      of directors keeps in balance a corporation’s risk, growth and returns at the most
                      appropriate level through strategic decisions and manages and represents the corporation
                      by firstly protecting the long-term benefits of the corporation through rational and prudent
                      risk management. Board of directors also has to define the strategic targets of the
                      corporation, establish the human and financial resources of the bank, and evaluate
                      management performance. The board must be composed of a minimum of independent
                      members for which the definition of “independent” is given. Among others, the
                      Communiqué requires the board of directors to conduct its activities in a transparent,
                      accountable, fair and responsible way.

                      There is not a special section in TCC for corporate governance principles, but these
                      principles are spread through the Code. The TCC addresses, inter alia, duties of care and
                      loyalty of the members of the board of directors, fair treatment of shareholders, and powers
                      of the board of directors. It also defines the liability of the members of the board of
                      directors and the managers for the damages they cause to the company, shareholders and
                      the company’s creditors. It also compels companies to announce specific information on
                      their websites.

EC2               The supervisor regularly assesses a bank’s corporate governance policies and practices, and
                  their implementation, and determines that the bank has robust corporate governance
                  policies and processes commensurate with its risk profile and systemic importance. The
                  supervisor requires banks and banking groups to correct deficiencies in a timely manner.

Description and   There are a number of ways in which the BRSA assesses the various elements of corporate
findings re EC2   governance in banks. This is accomplished through on and offsite supervision as well as
                  through the licensing process. The role of the board of directors and their responsibilities
                  are clearly anchored in, firstly, the banking law as well as other attendant regulation.
                  However, the validation of banks’ corporate governance on an ongoing basis through the
                  examination process requires concrete strengthening through a more holistic approach,
                  analysis, and well substantiated conclusions. This is a critical aspect of conducting effective
                  risk focused supervision.

                  A. Supervisory Process

                  The on-site and off-site supervision by BRSA is regulated in the Article 95 of BL. According
                  to Article 95(1) BRSA is responsible for the supervision of the implementation of the
                  regulations by the banks beside the financial safety and soundness supervision and also the
                  supervision of compliance with corporate governance principles. The supervision of
                  compliance with corporate governance principles is solely and especially mentioned as one
                  of the supervisory responsibilities of BRSA in this article. The sub-regulation related to
                  supervision by BRSA is RAA which includes in its scope the supervision of the financial
                  institutions’ compliance level to the corporate governance principles in its Article 2(1)(d).
                  RAA also mentions the assessment of the quality of the corporate governance in financial
                  institutions as a type of on-site supervision in the Article 14(1) (a-9).

                  As a part of the risk focused supervision (the IRA phase), the supervisors will scope the
                  activities for the upcoming cycle through various means. This includes, in part, meeting with
                  the board members, senior managers and independent auditors to understand recent
                  changes in the bank’s profile and activities. As a part of the cycle planning process and to
                  inform on governance, the supervisor will also review the board minutes, strategic plan,
                  budgeting, policies, procedures, audit reports, MIS, etc. according to the size, activities,
                  complexity and structure of the banks. Depending on the outcome of the IRA, special
                  examinations will be conducted of areas identified as concerns or special supervisory
                  interest.

                  The BRSA indicated that 3 special examinations focused on governance elements were
                  conducted in 2014/15.

                  B. On-site Supervision

                  In practice compliance with corporate governance principles and the assessment of quality
                  of compliance is taken into consideration during the CAMELS review/GAR methodology
                  supervision. In assigning M (for management) the supervisor evaluates mainly the following
                  elements:




94
                                                                                        TURKEY



•   MIS and its unrestricted access by examiners including the bank’s information systems
    and data including the bank’s foreign branches.

•   assessment of the accounting and financial reporting systems including adequacy of
    written processes for accounting and financial reporting, efficiency and effectiveness of
    the internal control/audit on these systems, the existence and number of manual
    and/or retrospective interventions on the accounting and financial reporting systems.

•   assessment of the internal systems which include internal control, risk management and
    internal audit which includes evaluation of the relevant structure, procedures, policies,
    compliance with the enforcement actions instructed by BRSA, and adequacy of
    contingency action plans.

•   assessment of the organization, management and business strategies including the
    objectives and reality of the strategic plan and its risks, organizational policies and
    procedures and internal regulations, duties and responsibilities of the staff, the relation
    between the bank’s board’s and senior managers’ success and the bank’s financial
    performance, risk management and compliance level.

•   assessment of human resources including evaluation of the policies and
    implementations in human resources management. As well, feedback from bank staff is
    considered and staff turnover in critical areas.

While assessing above mentioned elements, examiners more specifically address:

•   compliance of board numbers and qualifications;

•   if relevant policies, procedures, and workflows approved by the board and are they
    clearly defined; do conflicts of interest exist among procedures or workflows;

•   if a corporate governance committee exists; if an internal CG policy exists;

•   if a "corporate governance compliance report" exists;

•   policy on disclosure and transparency;

•   monitoring process for breaches in policies, procedures, limits and for informing the
    board.

Special examinations conducted by the examiners will feed into the CAMELS rating process
in a more informal way, by providing insight into the function of selected areas of the bank.
However, no concrete conclusions are drawn regarding the quality of board oversight or
corporate governance in general.

Also, supervisory review of the ICAAP process highlights governance elements of risk
management and more generally. Through this process, the GAR process, and the IRA work,
the bank’s current business strategies are reviewed and compared to last year’s plan and
projected numbers. The IRA process involves discussions with management, review of
performance, review of strategies, evaluation of bank resources, etc. These steps feed into
the responses to the CAMELS review/GAR process which in turn, creates the subcomponent




                                                                                              95

         ratings before leading to the assignment of the “M” in CAMELS which reflects governance
         elements. No analytical, critical narrative exists which reflects a collective view on corporate
         governance of a bank or the attendant systems and controls which compose it.

         C. Other supervisory activities

         Besides the regular CAMELS on-site supervision by BRSA, the BRSA reviews board member
         and senior management qualifications immediately following their appointment to their
         posts as per BL Articles 5 and 7.

         Similarly, approval of the top management team is necessary before the BRSA will authorize
         a bank to operate in Turkey. Besides these prerequisites for establishment and operation
         authorization of banks’ operations, BL Article 13 requires the banks to take the corporate
         governance regulations of BL into account while opening a new branch in Turkey. And
         Article 14 requires the banks to be compliant with the corporate governance regulations of
         BL for approvals to operate abroad.

         The BRSA has the authority to take corrective action when certain concerns and deficiencies
         are identified. Among these are failures by board and management to institute required
         internal systems in BL Article 67. Also, as a result of supervisory examinations and according
         to the severity of the findings and the responsibility of the board members, the composition
         of the board can be changed by BRSA according to these articles. The responsibility of
         supervision for determining the compliance with the corporate governance parameters is
         clearly mentioned in the Article 95(1) of BL and the related sub-regulation RAA Article 2 (d).
         The evaluation of the quality of the corporate governance management is one of the
         inevitable part of on-site supervision according to the Article 14(1)(a-9) of RAA.

         The team reviewed several examples of work performed by the examiners to test how
         observations about corporate governance were formed and the supervisory response
         thereafter. The work conducted by the examiners, both on and offsite, is extensive.
         However, the team found, through the review of several special examinations and the GAR
         database, the results of the examinations and supervisory processes consistently stopped
         short of drawing conclusions, in analytical, narrative form, on the implications the findings
         have for other critical areas of the bank(s) which reflect directly on the overall corporate
         governance effectiveness of the bank. As a result supervisory observations are not easily
         collected in order to form a more cross-cutting, substantiated view on critical internal
         systems and therefore, the boards’ ability to oversee the bank’s’ business.

         For instance, if a loan portfolio is reviewed, deficiencies may be identified but are not
         consistently linked to conclusions drawn about the 1) line and senior management and their
         ability to oversee their business and know their risks, 2) risk management adequacy and
         ability to proactively identify developing risks that management has not – and report such
         issues and trends to the board, 3) impact provisioning levels and implications on financial
         statement accuracy, 4) implications on internal audit’s role, 5) MIS particularly sent to the
         board, and 6) ultimately, board oversight. All of these linkages reflect directly on the
         strength and nature of corporate governance in a bank.

                  Without taking the examinations process further and drawing conclusions, assessment of
                  governance adequacy is much less able to leverage examination efforts to substantiate, and
                  perhaps change, the supervisory view on board and management ability to run and control
                  the bank’s business. This ultimately can impact the integrity of the “M” in the CAMELS.

EC3               The supervisor determines that governance structures and processes for nominating and
                  appointing Board members are appropriate for the bank and across the banking group.
                  Board membership includes experienced non-executive members, where appropriate.
                  Commensurate with the risk profile and systemic importance, Board structures include
                  audit, risk oversight and remuneration committees with experienced non-executive
                  members

Description and   Article 23(1) of BL states the minimum number of the members in a bank’s board of
findings re EC3   directors as five and also sets out the requirements for the members to be appointed. The
                  qualifications required for the general manager in BL shall also be required for majority of
                  the board of directors. So majority of the members must have at least undergraduate
                  degrees in the disciplines of law, economics, finance, banking, business administration,
                  public administration and related fields and those that have undergraduate degrees in
                  engineering fields must have a graduate degree in the aforementioned fields, and they
                  must have at least ten years of professional experience in the field of banking or business
                  administration. Other financial and personal requirements for the members of the board of
                  directors are listed in detail under Article 8. The board is held responsible for the
                  establishment, effectiveness, compliance and efficiency of the internal control, risk
                  management and internal audit systems according to the Article 23(3).

                  As mentioned above in EC 1, only 2 board members are required to be nonexecutive
                  commensurate with the requirement that the Audit Committee be composed of at least 2
                  nonexecutive members. There are no requirements for the majority of board members to
                  be nonexecutive. As a result, boards can potentially be composed of executive directors
                  except for the 2 required nonexecutives. The only possible influence against this is the
                  approval process conducted by the BRSA if it was to disapprove such a structure. However,
                  there is no regulatory or practical support for this given the above structure of the law and
                  regulation.

                  The one required board committee is the audit committee. As mentioned in EC 1 above,
                  Article 24(1) of the BL provides that a banks’ board of directors shall establish audit
                  committees for the execution of the audit and monitoring functions in the name of the
                  board of directors and audit committee shall consist of minimum two non-executive board
                  members. According to the Article 24(3) the main duties and responsibilities of the audit
                  committee include the supervision of the efficiency and adequacy of the bank’s internal
                  control, risk management and internal audit systems, functioning of these systems and the
                  accounting and reporting systems and the integrity of the information produced. In RICAAP
                  the Article 4(2) it is repeated that the internal systems units can only be established directly
                  under the board. In the same paragraph it is clearly mentioned that the responsibility for
                  the internal systems may only be fully or partially assigned to one of the non-executive



                                                                                                               97

                    directors or to committees composed of such directors or to the audit committee. In most
                    banks, the audit committees are responsible risk oversight as well as the audit and control
                    function oversight. However, some banks, depending on the size and complexity of their
                    operations, have established board risk committees as well.

                    The remuneration committee for the banks is regulated under paragraph 12 of the
                    Guideline on Best Compensation Practices of Banks (GBCP); it is not a required committee.
                    This committee is comprised of at least two non-executive members of board of directors
                    who have sufficient information and experience regarding remuneration policies and
                    internal systems as a whole. Besides this sub-regulation the second paragraph of the
                    Principle 6 of RCGB mentions that the remuneration committee which is responsible for the
                    monitoring and supervision of the remuneration policies in the name of the board of
                    directors to be comprised of two members. This committee is to evaluate the remuneration
                    policies and implementations under the risk management principles and to report their
                    findings to the board at least annually. The three largest banks have appointed
                    remuneration committees.

                    The BRSA approves board and senior management appointments. In this way, the BRSA
                    reviews the appointments process of the subject bank. Checklists have been prepared by
                    BRSA for use in the evaluation process. The assessment process not only includes
                    examining the documents submitted to the BRSA but also browsing the BRSA database. If
                    the assessment shows that the individual is not fit and proper for the appointment, the
                    bank will be informed about the situation and instructed to appoint a different individual.
                    Furthermore, the board members and senior managers are responsible for notifying BRSA
                    in case of a change in their situation after they are appointed (RSMOD, article 8). The
                    appointments process itself is not a focus of examination to date.

                    As indicated above, the BRSA conducted 3 special examinations of governance elements
                    during 2014/15; however, there is a need to form more holistic conclusions about
                    governance on a more regular basis and conduct cross sector assessments of corporate
                    governance, leveraging examination and offsite inputs.

33 The OECD (OECD glossary of corporate governance-related terms in “Experiences from the Regional Corporate
Governance Roundtables”, 2003, www.oecd.org/dataoecd/19/26/23742340.pdf.) defines “duty of care” as “The duty
of a board member to act on an informed and prudent basis in decisions with respect to the company. Often
interpreted as requiring the board member to approach the affairs of the company in the same way that a ’prudent
man’ would approach their own affairs. Liability under the duty of care is frequently mitigated by the business
judgment rule.” The OECD defines “duty of loyalty” as “The duty of the board member to act in the interest of the
company and shareholders. The duty of loyalty should prevent individual board members from acting in their own
interest, or the interest of another individual or group, at the expense of the company and all shareholders.”

                     Board member and senior management qualifications criteria are set out in Article 23(1) of
                     BL and addressed in EC 1 and 3 above.

                     Articles 7, 9 and 10 of BL requires the board members to meet the qualifications set out in
                     corporate governance provisions as a prerequisite for establishment and operating
                     permission. Besides the Article 7(1)(d), Article 9(d) requires the same qualifications for any
                     bank established abroad that wants to operate in Turkey by opening branch.

                     Principle 3 of the RCGB requires that management shall have the qualifications to fulfill
                     efficiently their duty and be conscious of their role; board members are to be well-
                     intentioned, informative, wise, and ethical, to be aware of their duties and responsibilities,
                     to have time and to participate actively in the bank business.

                     TCC Article 369 defines duty of care and duty of loyalty of the board members and the third
                     persons in charge of management. According to this provision, these persons have to fulfill
                     their duties with care as prudent managers and act in good faith while overseeing
                     company’s interest.

EC5                  The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board approves and oversees implementation of
                     the bank’s strategic direction, risk appetite 34 and strategy, and related policies, establishes
                     and communicates corporate culture and values (e.g., through a code of conduct), and
                     establishes conflicts of interest policies and a strong control environment.

Description and      As mentioned in EC 1 according to the Article 23(3) of BL the responsibilities of the board of
findings re EC5      directors should include ensuring the establishment, functionality, appropriateness and
                     adequacy of internal control, risk management and internal audit systems which are
                     compliant with the regulations, and besides the specification of the powers and
                     responsibilities within a bank.

                     Main regulations addressing risk appetite, strategic policies, communication channels and
                     conflict of interest issues are covered in the RICAAP. Following the definition of risk appetite
                     in the Article 3(1) (gg), the responsibilities of the board are regulated in the 5th Article. The
                     Article 5(1) of RICAAP determines the board of directors as the ultimate responsible body
                     for the establishment, effective, adequate and efficient implementation of internal systems
                     in a bank. With respect to this responsibility, in the Article 5(2)(g) the board is held
                     responsible for and authorized to determine and monitor the strategic decision making
                     process and besides to maintain the determination of planning policies. Furthermore, in
                     Article 5(2)(h) one of the board’s responsibilities is mentioned as to determine the bank's
                     policies and strategies relating to risk management in general and separately for each risk
                     type, risk level the bank can take and related implementation procedures, to allocate
                     maximum risk limits for units and their managers or the personnel working in those units.
                     Article 5(2)(ı) requires the board to identify the bank's risk appetite, to ensure that business


34 “Risk appetite” reflects the level of aggregate risk that the bank’s Board is willing to assume and manage in the
pursuit of the bank’s business objectives. Risk appetite may include both quantitative and qualitative elements, as
appropriate, and encompass a range of measures. For the purposes of this document, the terms “risk appetite” and
“risk tolerance” are treated synonymously.



                                                                                                                   99

         lines, managers of the units within the scope of the internal systems and internal systems
         manager gather and exchange ideas, to resolve the communication problems between
         business lines within the aim of developing an effective risk management point of view
         throughout the bank and to ensure that business lines are informed about the
         developments, risks and risk mitigation techniques in the market.

         The audit committee, as an extension of the board, according to Article 24 of BL, is also
         responsible for the supervision of the efficiency and adequacy of the bank’s internal
         systems, including the bank’s control environment, and the integrity of MIS therein.

         Regarding potential conflicts of interest, requirements for functional division of tasks in a
         bank is regulated in RICAAP

         article 10 in order to prevent mistakes, fraud, conflicts of interest, manipulation of
         information and misuse of resources at the bank. According to this article the powers and
         responsibilities of all units, personnel and committees within the bank shall be determined
         clearly and in writing, with a division of tasks in relation to the activities on the same
         subject. Banks need to comply with the regulation which requires that activities from which
         conflicts of interest may arise to be identified and minimized and the activities of approving
         transactions, accounting and recording transactions, and monitoring and managing the
         transaction are appropriately segregated. As well, RCGB Principle 1 addresses possible
         conflicts of interest within senior management responsibilities.

         The establishment of communication structure and communication channels is regulated in
         the Article 12 of RICAAP. According to 12(1) it shall be ensured that information vertically
         and horizontally flows within the organizational structure of the bank so as to reach the
         relevant levels of management and the responsible personnel in safety and that the
         managers of lower units and the operational personnel are fully informed of the bank’s
         objectives, strategies, policies, implementation procedures and expectations. Information to
         be directed towards personnel shall include data concerning the policies related to bank
         activities, their implementation procedures, and the activity performance of the bank. It
         shall be ensured that the bank personnel are aware of the rules concerning their duties and
         responsibilities and that the necessary information rapidly reaches the concerned personnel.

         Besides in the Article 7(2)(c) of the RICAAP audit committee members are held responsible
         for and authorized to establish communication channels which enable the committee to be
         informed and to check whether personnel who are authorized to lend have been involved in
         the evaluation and/or the decision making process of certain identified borrowers, e.g.,
         themselves, their spouses, dependent children and other natural persons or legal entities
         which constitute a risk group.

         While internal codes of conduct are not explicitly required, the team was informed that
         many banks do, in fact, have them. This, as well as strategy, risk appetite, and internal
         communication channels could all be topics addressed in a corporate governance
         evaluation by the supervisor.

                  against standards established for them.

Description and   The educational and experience requirements for the senior managers are mainly
findings re EC6   determined in Article 25 of BL. The Article 25(1) mentions the requirements for the general
                  managers while Article 25(2) does the same for the deputy general managers.

                  The Principle 2 in RCGB requires the board of directors to determine the duties and
                  responsibilities of the senior management in a bank while it also empowers the board to
                  monitor the compliance level of senior management’s activities to the policies which have
                  been put in place by the Board itself.

                  According to the points (a) and (c) of the Article 5(2) of the RICAAP, the board of directors
                  of the bank is authorized and liable for

                  •   establishing the organizational structure and human resources policy of the bank and
                      to determine the criteria for the appointment of senior management and

                  •   determining the written strategies, policies and the implementation procedures
                      concerning the activities of the units included within the scope of the internal systems
                      and ensuring that these are implemented and maintained effectively and coordinated
                      with each other.

                  There currently is no requirement for banks to develop succession plans for key
                  management positions. As mentioned in EC 5 and 3 above, there is not yet a cross-cutting
                  supervisory evaluation process of a bank’s corporate governance function.

EC7               The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board actively oversees the design and operation
                  of the bank’s and banking group’s compensation system, and that it has appropriate
                  incentives, which are aligned with prudent risk taking. The compensation system, and
                  related performance standards, are consistent with long-term objectives and financial
                  soundness of the bank and is rectified if there are deficiencies.

Description and   Best practice guidelines for the structure and management of remuneration frameworks
findings re EC7   within an effective risk management environment are comprehensively enumerated in the
                  GBCP. Paragraph 8 of this guideline states that it is the responsibility of board of directors
                  of the bank to approve, periodically review and oversee the implementation of the
                  remuneration policy. Remuneration policies and practices should be consistent with the
                  complexity of activities, individual risk profile, risk appetite and strategy of a bank.

                  The GBCP paragraph 9 directs that the remuneration policy should support sound risk
                  management within the bank and not be associated with excessive short-term profit-
                  making goals and does not incentivize risk-taking that is beyond tolerated risk level of the
                  institution. The remuneration policy should also be in line with the scope and size of the
                  operations, risk management structure, business strategy, long-term financial soundness



                                                                                                               101

                  and capital adequacy level of the institution, and incorporates measures to avoid conflicts
                  of interest.

                  Further, the GBCP paragraph 11 states that the bank should consider the impact of
                  remuneration policies on soundness indicators such as capital and liquidity and in case of a
                  threat against capital adequacy or when needed, a more conservative policy should be
                  followed on all remuneration issues, mainly the variable remuneration. Further, variable pay
                  levels should be established in relation to the performance of their unit as well as the bank’s
                  overall performance. The impact of risk taken should also factor into remuneration
                  formulas. When determining the performance of identified staff, financial and non-financial
                  criteria should be considered.

                  As well, principle 6 of RCGB directs that remuneration framework should be aligned with a
                  bank’s ethical values and strategic targets. Compensation shall not be based on short-term
                  performance or be guaranteed in advance.

                  No explicit supervisory reviews have been undertaken to date to address banks’
                  remuneration frameworks. Again, as mentioned in EC 5 and 3 above, this could be an area
                  to include in a cross-cutting supervisory evaluation process of a bank’s corporate
                  governance function.

EC8               The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board and senior management know and
                  understand the bank’s and banking group’s operational structure and its risks, including
                  those arising from the use of structures that impede transparency (e.g., special-purpose or
                  related structures). The supervisor determines that risks are effectively managed and
                  mitigated, where appropriate.

Description and   Legislation does not explicitly direct boards and senior management to “know your
findings re EC8   structure” but they must have knowledge of the bank’s related structures in order to assess
                  individual and consolidated risk exposures and to prepare ICAAP on a consolidated basis.
                  The bank’s Board and senior management’s responsibilities are defined in RICAAP. Articles
                  5-8 regulate the responsibilities of top management (which includes key senior
                  management and the board of directors) regarding the establishment of the internal
                  systems (including risk management systems). This requires top management to set policies
                  and strategies relating the risk management as well as to establish the bank’s risk appetite
                  and maintain sufficient capital as determined through ICAAP. ICAAP must be prepared on a
                  consolidated basis, therefore bank management must know and understand all the risks to
                  which the bank is exposed. In addition; the “intra-group transactions report” that has to be
                  prepared each year guarantees that the bank management sees the financial relationship
                  between group entities. Please also refer to CP12 for consolidated supervision framework of
                  BRSA.

EC9               The supervisor has the power to require changes in the composition of the bank’s Board if it
                  believes that any individuals are not fulfilling their duties related to the satisfaction of these
                  criteria.

Description and   According to the article 69 (b) of the BL, in the context of points (e), (f) and (g) of Article 67
findings re EC9   to eliminate violations, the BRSB has the power to require the bank to call on the general
                  assembly to convene an extraordinary meeting to change one or several or all of the
                  members of board of directors or to appoint new members by increasing the number of
                  board members if the board of directors’ members have responsibility in decisions,
                  transactions and practices.

                  Furthermore; the article 70(c) of the BL clearly empowers the BRSB to require the bank to
                  dismiss one or all of the board members or together with the general manager, deputy
                  general managers, and/or relevant unit and branch directors in cases where the bank fails
                  to take measures laid down in Article 68 and/or 69. The same article requires the approval
                  of BRSA for persons to be appointed or selected in place of the persons removed from
                  office.

                  The supervisor’s responsibility for detecting compliance with the corporate governance
                  principles is laid out in the BL Article 95(1) and the RAA Article 2(d). The evaluation of the
                  quality of the corporate governance management is one of the key parts of on-site
                  supervision according to the Article 14(1)(a-9) of RAA. Findings regarding CG enables the
                  BRSB to take action against the board or specific board members in case of breaches of CG
                  regulations and principles.

                  Another tool held by BRSA, contained in BL Article 26(2), is the ability to revoke the signing
                  authority of any bank employee who is found to have infringed provisions of BL or related
                  regulation, has endangered the safety and soundness of the bank, and legal proceedings
                  have been requested. These provisions apply to not only staff but also to board members.
                  There have been cases where such signing authority has been revoked, mainly dealing with
                  bank staff. Only one instance did such action involve a bank director.

Additional
criteria

AC1               Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to notify the supervisor as soon as they
                  become aware of any material and bona fide information that may negatively affect the
                  fitness and propriety of a bank’s Board member or a member of the senior management.

Description and
findings re AC1

Assessment of     Materially Non-compliant
Principle 14

Comments          The legal framework surrounding the corporate governance framework for banks is
                  extensive, but very heavily focused on board responsibilities regarding internal systems (risk
                  management, internal control, internal audit). Examination processes (GAR and specialized
                  examinations) have required steps to check board approvals, internal structures, and
                  processes which reflect on the governance function. The BRSA approves board and senior




                                                                                                                103
TURKEY



         management appointments. In this way, the BRSA reviews the appointments process of the
         bank.

         However, the results of special examinations and supervisory processes consistently stop
         short of drawing conclusions, in analytical, narrative form, on the implications the findings
         have for critical areas that are directly linked to the examined area. These critical areas
         reflect directly on the corporate governance effectiveness of the bank (such as management
         oversight of business areas, adequacy of risk management and internal audit’s role in the
         subject areas, integrity of MIS that goes up to the board level, and ultimately, board
         oversight). As a result, supervisory observations are not easily collected in order to form a
         more cross-cutting, substantiated view on corporate governance and the adequacy of
         internal systems. Therefore, validation of the manner in which such internal systems and
         governance operates is not well supported. This impacts the degree to which the BRSA
         should place confidence in the systems that inform the board and itself, as well as the
         systems’ ability to generate early warning indicators of deterioration.

         There is no requirement for the majority of the board to be composed of non-executive
         members which could result in, potentially, boards being composed of a majority of
         executive directors with only the 2 nonexecutives as currently required by the legal
         framework. However, practically speaking, 10 out of 53 banks are listed and must fall under
         the CMB Communique on governance which requires a majority of independent directors.
         Consideration should be given to upgrading banking legislation requiring the board to be
         composed of a majority of nonexecutive members, and ideally, with a certain minimum of
         independent individuals. (The definition of “independent” should be consistent with that
         used by the CMB in its Communiqué on Corporate Governance.)

         Audit committee membership should be expanded. While some bank boards in the system
         have populated this committee with more members, a minimum of 2 members is
         considered too few in order to execute the duties assigned to it in a robust and effective
         manner. This is particularly so since the audit committee is considered an extension of the
         board and is assigned the task of internal systems oversight which includes risk
         management. In addition, the chair of this committee, in some banks, is also the chairman
         of the board which does not reflect best practice and potentially represents a conflict of
         interest. This committee should be expanded and should be composed of all independent
         directors. As well, legislation directs that the audit committees have oversight responsibility
         for internal systems which includes risk management. Under the current audit committee
         structures, proper oversight of both critical areas is difficult at best. Risk management
         oversight responsibility should be separated from the audit committee, particularly in the
         more complex institutions (it was noted that one bank has, in fact, constituted a separate
         risk management committee).

         While (3) special inspections of governance elements have been conducted, there is a need
         to more regularly conduct cross-cutting assessment of corporate governance in a holistic
         manner which would, in part, leverage examination results and relevant offsite information
         as well as information generated from any enforcement actions. Consideration could be

                     given to introducing such reviews on a more regular basis in order to enhance and better
                     substantiate conclusions on the adequacy of a bank’s corporate governance.

                     Given the observations cited in the above ECs (board membership/objectivity, board
                     nominations process, board committee structure and membership, management oversight
                     and performance evaluation, succession planning, “know your structure requirements”,
                     internal code of conduct, etc.) the BRSA should develop a more comprehensive corporate
                     governance regulation that completes the elements of governance that already exist in
                     guidelines and regulation. This type of instrument could be a focal point of supervisory
                     corporate governance reviews in the future.

Principle 15         Risk management process. The supervisor determines that banks 35 have a comprehensive
                     risk management process (including effective Board and senior management oversight) to
                     identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate 36 all material risks on a
                     timely basis and to assess the adequacy of their capital and liquidity in relation to their risk
                     profile and market and macroeconomic conditions. This extends to development and
                     review of contingency arrangements (including robust and credible recovery plans where
                     warranted) that take into account the specific circumstances of the bank. The risk
                     management process is commensurate with the risk profile and systemic importance of the
                     bank. 37

Essential criteria

EC1                  The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate risk management strategies that
                     have been approved by the banks’ Boards and that the Boards set a suitable risk appetite to
                     define the level of risk the banks are willing to assume or tolerate. The supervisor also
                     determines that the Board ensures that:

                     a)   a sound risk management culture is established throughout the bank;
                     b)   policies and processes are developed for risk-taking, that are consistent with the risk
                          management strategy and the established risk appetite;
                     c)   uncertainties attached to risk measurement are recognized;
                     d)   appropriate limits are established that are consistent with the bank’s risk appetite, risk
                          profile and capital strength, and that are understood by, and regularly communicated
                          to, relevant staff; and


35For the purposes of assessing risk management by banks in the context of Principles 15 to 25, a bank’s risk
management framework should take an integrated “bank-wide” perspective of the bank’s risk exposure,
encompassing the bank’s individual business lines and business units. Where a bank is a member of a group of
companies, the risk management framework should in addition cover the risk exposure across and within the
“banking group” (see footnote 19 under Principle 1) and should also take account of risks posed to the bank or
members of the banking group through other entities in the wider group.
36To some extent the precise requirements may vary from risk type to risk type (Principles 15 to 25) as reflected by
the underlying reference documents.
37 It
   should be noted that while, in this and other Principles, the supervisor is required to determine that banks’ risk
management policies and processes are being adhered to, the responsibility for ensuring adherence remains with a
bank’s Board and senior management.

                  e)   senior management takes the steps necessary to monitor and control all material risks
                       consistent with the approved strategies and risk appetite.

Description and   The focus of this BCP 15 is on both the framework for the overall risk management process in
findings re EC1   banks (both the legal and implementation aspects) as well as the BRSA’s supervisory process
                  over this critical function. The actual implementation of the framework and supervisory
                  process, and the results it renders, are specifically addressed in the respective Principles which
                  follow.

                  The BL Articles 29 and 31 state the obligations pertaining to internal systems (internal
                  control, risk management and internal audit systems). According to Article 29, banks are
                  obliged to establish and operate adequate and efficient internal systems that are in
                  harmony with the scope and structure of their activities, that can respond to changing
                  conditions and that cover all their branches and undertakings subject to consolidation in
                  order to monitor and control the risks that they encounter. In Article 31, within their risk
                  management frameworks, banks shall establish, implement and report risk policies within
                  the framework set by the BRSB. Risk management activities shall be performed by the risk
                  management department and personnel who work under the board of directors.

                  Based on the above mentioned BL articles, RICAAP has been issued for the purpose of
                  setting procedures and principles for the establishment and functioning of the internal
                  systems (internal audit, internal control and risk management systems) and internal capital
                  assessment process. While the ultimate output of ICAAP is the derivation of the internal
                  capital requirement and capital projections for the upcoming three years under different
                  economic scenarios, the process is highly dependent on banks’ internal risk management,
                  their assessment of its adequacy, and the risk based measures of capital needs.

                  It is through this process that the BRSA has enumerated comprehensive regulation
                  addressing requirements for robust risk management systems. This regulation, RICAAP,
                  underpins to a very significant extent, BRSA’s expected risk management framework in
                  banks which reflects much of what is international standard. The guidance offered by
                  RICAAAP is cited throughout the risk section of this assessment and is pivotal to the
                  evaluation of the adequacy of the system’s risk framework. Equally important,
                  implementation of RICCAP and other essential regulation and directions have been
                  evaluated to determine the extent that the requirements have taken root and are used
                  effectively to identify, measure, and control risk.

                  ICAAP is a relatively recent development in the country’s banking system. As a result, banks’
                  are still developing their approach and implementing important systems. The BCP team’s
                  review of supervisors’ working papers and discussion with banks indicated that banks as
                  well as supervisors are, in fact, in a relatively early phase. The quality of banks reports and
                  the scrutiny of the reports by supervisors will need to develop further before the results can
                  be more reliable and more extensively used.

The BL directs that internal systems shall be established directly under the Board of
Directors. The board may transfer all or part of its duties and responsibilities to the internal
systems manager. It is also possible to have a senior manager such as an executive vice
president who does not have any hierarchical link with CEO and whose performance
evaluation is conducted by the board of directors or the audit committee. Furthermore,
powers and duties of the board of directors, audit committee, and the senior management
regarding the risk management system are determined in the RICAAP as well as
establishment of internal capital assessment process.

As well, the board of directors of the bank is responsible for determining, in writing, the
strategies, policies and the implementation procedures concerning the activities of the units
included within the scope of the internal systems and to ensure that they are implemented
and maintained effectively and coordinated with each other. The section further states that
(the board of directors) will determine in writing the bank's polices and strategies relating
to risk management in general and separately for each risk type, risk level the bank can take
and related implementation procedures, to allocate maximum risk limits for units and their
managers or the personnel working in those units.

RICAAP Article 5 states that (the Board of Directors) will identify the bank's risk appetite, to
ensure that business lines, managers of the units within the scope of the internal systems
and internal systems manager gather and exchange ideas, to resolve the communication
problems between business lines within the aim of developing an effective risk
management point of view throughout the bank and to ensure that business lines are
informed about the developments, risks and risk mitigation techniques in the market.

As well, Article 39 (1) states that banks are obliged to establish a structure comprised of
policies and processes to determine the risk appetite and monitor the conformity of units to
the risk appetite. (2) Banks are obliged to set, measure, monitor and manage the risk limits
for controlling the current risk profile in order not to exceed the risk appetite approved by
the board of directors. Risk appetite structure shall be reviewed when necessary, once in a
year at a minimum.

Culture, policies, processes, limits, and monitoring

RICAAP Article 38 (1-3) states that (banks must establish) risk limits associated clearly with
the loss amount and allocated capital amount, connected with the risk appetite. Within this
scope, risk appetite approved by the board of directors is shared to risk types, units,
business lines and products as well as other levels deemed necessary and allocated.
Furthermore, transaction limits are established per personnel, sub-unit or unit for risk limits
in the required areas, mainly credit allocation and treasury transactions. Banks shall
determine implementation procedures concerning proposal, assessment, approval,
notifying in the bank, monitoring and audit processes of risk limits and the principles
determined are approved by the board of directors. Surveillance responsibility for the
bank's risk profile not to exceed risk limits and values realized to be monitored by top
management of the bank belongs to the board of directors. Risk limits are determined as a
part of risk appetite on consolidated and non-consolidated basis by considering the size of

         bank in financial system. The risk limits shall be regularly reviewed and adapted in
         accordance with changes in market conditions and in the bank strategy.

         RICAAP Article 35 (4) states that banks are obliged to establish and implement an effective
         risk management system for material risks in compliance with volume, complexity, and level
         of activities that bear risks. In addition to Pillar 1 risks, Pillar 2 risks shall also be taken into
         account considering their level of importance. Moreover, risks which are minor on their own
         but which may cause significant losses when combined with other risk types are also
         included.

         RICAAP Article 38 requires banks to put in place board approved written limits and risk
         appetites for each risk type on consolidated and non-consolidated basis by considering the
         size of bank in the financial system. The risk limits are regularly reviewed and adapted in
         accordance with changes in market conditions and in the bank strategy. Risk limits are
         notified to related units and it is ensured that related personnel understands them. Limit
         usages are monitored closely and limit exceeding is notified to the senior management
         promptly in order to take necessary actions.

         Article 4 of the RICAAP imposes banks to establish and operate adequate and effective
         internal systems in conformity with the scope and nature of their activities in order to
         monitor and control the risks to which they are exposed. BRSA requires banks to implement
         the principles by considering banks' own scales, risk profiles; activities, volume, nature and
         complexity of their business and transactions. It’s also necessary to make written
         explanations and retentions for the principles which are not implemented totally or partially
         [Article (4)(1)(m) of RAA].

         According to the Article 46 of RICAAP, banks are obliged to calculate the capital internally
         which will meet the risks exposed or which may be exposed on consolidated and non-
         consolidated basis and maintain their activities with a capital higher than this amount on
         consolidated and non-consolidated basis. The ICAAP process determines that the
         management body; a) accurately and comprehensively identify, measure, aggregate,
         monitor and report the bank’s risks, b) calculate and hold adequate internal capital in
         relation to the bank’s risk profile, risk management process, adequacy of internal systems,
         strategies and activity plan, c) establish and use sound risk management systems and
         develop them further. The ICAAP also considers the impact of economic cycles, and
         sensitivity to other external risks and factors. The ICAAP shall be integrated to the bank's
         organizational structure, risk appetite framework and activity processes; and shall form a
         basis for them.

         Supervisory (onsite) manual

         There are several criteria in the Supervisory Manual on Risk Assessment Criteria (SMRAC)
         that require BRSA onsite examiners to take into consideration the strategies, policies and
         processes concerning following risk categories; credit risk, operational risk, strategic risk,
         reputational risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, market risk, country
         and transfer risk, concentration risk, residual risk, model risk, counterparty credit risk. In

                  SMRAC, there are assessment criteria for each risk category to evaluate the effectiveness of
                  risk management.

                  For example, in the credit risk area, the criteria help the examiners to evaluate risk
                  management strategy whether the Board and senior management set a suitable risk
                  appetite to define the level of credit risk the bank is willing to assume or tolerate. In
                  addition to this, the examiner determines that if a sound credit risk management culture is
                  established throughout the bank; policy and processes are developed for risk taking that
                  are consistent with the risk management strategy and the established risk appetite;
                  appropriate credit limits are established that are consistent with the bank’s risk appetite, risk
                  profile, and that are understood by relevant personnel; and senior management takes the
                  necessary steps to monitor and control credit risk consistent with the approved strategies
                  and risk appetite. The authority and liability of the relevant staff is defined clearly and the
                  necessary steps in case of deficiency are defined.

                  CAMELS review/GAR methodology

                  The GAR process directs examiners to evaluate policies, strategies and processes,
                  contingency plans to determine if they address material risks such as operational risk issues
                  in departments such as corporate/small and medium enterprises/retail loans, credit cards,
                  accounting and reporting systems, derivatives etc.

EC2               The supervisor requires banks to have comprehensive risk management policies and
                  processes to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate all material
                  risks. The supervisor determines that these processes are adequate:

                  a)   to provide a comprehensive “bank-wide” view of risk across all material risk types;
                  b)   for the risk profile and systemic importance of the bank; and
                  c)   to assess risks arising from the macroeconomic environment affecting the markets in
                       which the bank operates and to incorporate such assessments into the bank’s risk
                       management process.

Description and   As stated in EC1 above, RICAAP comprehensively addresses the risk management function
findings re EC2   in banks.

                  The complexity level of risk management system is formed in proportion with the bank’s
                  size and the complexity of its activities. If BRSA finds the mentioned level insufficient, banks
                  are obliged to remove this insufficiency within a timeframe to be determined by BRSA
                  (Article 35(3) and 35(5)).

                  Banks should have comprehensive risk management policies and processes to identify,
                  measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate all material risks. In addition, the
                  management of the material risks in the bank’s risk profile and providing a comprehensive
                  “bank-wide” view of risk across all material risk types are arranged in the RICAAP Articles 5,
                  35, 37, 38, 39, 42, 45.

                  RICAAP Article 38 requires banks to put in place board approved written limits and risk
                  appetites for each risk type on consolidated and non-consolidated basis by considering the



                                                                                                                109

                  size of bank in the financial system. The risk limits are regularly reviewed and adapted in
                  accordance with changes in market conditions and in the bank strategy. Risk limits are
                  notified to related units and it is ensured that related personnel understands them. Limit
                  usages are monitored closely and limit exceeding is notified to the senior management
                  promptly in order to take necessary actions.

                  The article 36(2) of the RICAAP states that risk management policies and implementation
                  procedures must adapt to changing conditions. The board of directors or the relevant
                  internal systems manager shall regularly assess their adequacy and make the necessary
                  changes. In addition, according to the 42(6) of the RICAAP, the risk measurement methods
                  and models should be periodically updated to reflect changing market conditions.

                  Macroeconomic environment affecting the markets in which the bank operates is assessed
                  in ICAAP reports as stated in the GICAAPR (section “2. General Assessment and
                  Expectations”) in a detailed manner because of the fact that it may cause material risks for
                  the bank.

                  During the CAMELS review/GAR methodology process, as well as during special
                  examinations, supervisors check whether a bank has suitable policies and processes that
                  clearly articulate roles and responsibilities related to the identification, measurement,
                  monitoring and control of the material risks. As well, the examiners review banks’ strategy,
                  policies, procedures and growth budgets pertaining to various risks, including their
                  implementation, and invites bank management’s attention to areas of concern. Banks’
                  business plans in relation to their risk profile, capital, manpower skills, historical
                  performance, adequacy of procedures and controls are evaluated.

EC3               The supervisor determines that risk management strategies, policies, processes and limits
                  are:

                  a)     properly documented;
                  b)     regularly reviewed and appropriately adjusted to reflect changing risk appetites, risk
                         profiles and market and macroeconomic conditions; and
                  c)     communicated within the bank.

                  The supervisor determines that exceptions to established policies, processes and limits
                  receive the prompt attention of, and authorization by, the appropriate level of management
                  and the bank’s Board where necessary.

Description and   RICAAP Article 5 and provisions that are mentioned in EC1 require that risk management
findings re EC3   strategies, policies, processes and limits are documented; regularly reviewed and adjusted
                  to reflect changing risk appetites, risk profiles, market and macroeconomic conditions;
                  communicated within the bank. Article 12 regulates establishment of the communication

                  responsibilities of risk management unit and personnel, risk measurement and its process,
                  stress testing to be performed by bank, data management process and reporting of risks
                  within the banks are regulated in Section Four (articles 35-45), “the Risk Management
                  System” of the Regulation.

                  Due to RICAAP, article 63(6), banks are required to prepare ICAAP reports every year. In
                  these reports, banks give detailed information about their risk management strategies,
                  policies, processes, limits and risk appetites. Banks are obliged to submit these reports to
                  BRSA in the first quarter of every year. Banks should have detailed risk management
                  strategy documents to prepare these reports. Furthermore, in the section “5. Risk
                  management” of GICAAPR, all material risks are taken into consideration in terms of
                  identification, measurement, management/control and mitigation as well as risk appetite
                  and risk limits.

                  In addition to this, banks are required to list internal regulations, communiqués, action
                  plans and decisions by which the policies and procedures and business flows and processes
                  are determined and duties and responsibilities are assigned relating to corporate
                  governance, management of each risk type (identification, measurement, monitoring,
                  control and reporting) capital and liquidity planning within risk management structure and
                  submit these documents to the BRSA in the annex of the ICAAP Report. Inside the Report,
                  amendments made to regulations within the period, as well as new regulations entered into
                  force and justified information about abolished ones are given to express the progress in
                  the bank's risk management capacity and its elasticity face to changing conditions.

                  In the on-site supervision process, the BRSA examiners are informed about important
                  decisions taken by banks and are able to access and assess banks’ policies, processes,
                  strategies, exceptions and internal reports on an ongoing basis. On-site examination reports
                  make observations on banks’ compliance with internal and regulatory limits. As a part of the
                  routine examination, BRSA examiners evaluate whether the risk management strategies,
                  policies, processes and limits are documented and limits are monitored by the top
                  management with the help of GAR module.

EC4               The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board and senior management obtain sufficient
                  information on, and understand, the nature and level of risk being taken by the bank and
                  how this risk relates to adequate levels of capital and liquidity. The supervisor also
                  determines that the Board and senior management regularly review and understand the
                  implications and limitations (including the risk measurement uncertainties) of the risk
                  management information that they receive.

Description and   RICAAP Article 5 stipulates that the bank’s Board and senior management get sufficient
findings re EC4   information on, and understand, the nature and level of material risks being taken by the
                  bank and how these risks relate to adequate levels of capital and liquidity. In addition to
                  this, the Board and senior management shall regularly review and understand the risk
                  management information that they receive from the all units of the bank. RICAAP Article
                  5(3) states that the board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the bank has
                  adequate capital to support its risks by means of establishment and implementation of the

                  ICAAP. It needs to ensure that the bank management establishes a framework for assessing
                  the various risks, develops a system to relate risk to the bank’s capital level, and establishes
                  a method for monitoring compliance with internal policies. Also, information on the nature
                  and level of risk being taken by the bank should be reported to the Board of directors and
                  top management according to the article 45 of the RICAAP.

                  Banks shall prepare a report including their assessments on risk measurement, capital and
                  liquidity planning as well as risk management abilities made within the scope of the ICAAP
                  according to Article 56(1) of RICAAP.

                  In the Risk Assessment (CAMELS) phase of supervision, BRSA examiners assess whether the
                  bank’s top management obtains sufficient information about material risks that are taken
                  by the bank and regularly reviews and understands the implications and limitations of the
                  risk management information that they receive.

EC5               The supervisor determines that banks have an appropriate internal process for assessing
                  their overall capital and liquidity adequacy in relation to their risk appetite and risk profile.
                  The supervisor reviews and evaluates banks’ internal capital and liquidity adequacy
                  assessments and strategies.

Description and   In addition to abovementioned requirements (EC1-EC4), banks are also required to assess
findings re EC5   their internal capital and liquidity adequacy. They are required to have an ICAAP process
                  and the provisions regarding this process are regulated in RICAAP. Banks are required to
                  submit an ICAAP report once in a year and requirements of ICAAP reporting is regulated in
                  GICAAPR.

                  In the ICAAP reports, banks assess their capital and liquidity adequacy according to section
                  “6. Capital Planning” and “9. Liquidity Planning” of GICAAPR respectively. Moreover, there is
                  detailed information about how to carry out these capital and liquidity plans in other parts
                  of the GICAAPR.

                  According to Article 56(2) of the RICAAP, Bank's analysis and assessments relating to capital
                  and liquidity adequacy and planning in the ICAAP Report are assessed in the examinations
                  made by the BRSA. In addition, there are also specific provisions concerning the audits
                  conducted by the BRSA in terms of capital and liquidity adequacy, in the sections “3.
                  Regulatory Capital Adequacy”, “4. Internal Capital Adequacy”, “5. Adequacy of Liquidity”, “6.
                  Stress Tests” of the GAA.

                  As stated in EC 1, ICAAP is a relatively recent development in the country’s banking system.
                  As a result, banks’ are still developing their approach and implementing important systems.
                  The BCP team’s review of supervisors’ working papers and discussion with banks indicated
                  that banks as well as supervisors are, in fact, in a learning phase. The quality of banks
                  reports and the annual review of the reports by supervisors will need to develop further
                  before the results can be more reliable and more extensively used.

EC6               Where banks use models to measure components of risk, the supervisor determines that:

                  a)   banks comply with supervisory standards on their use;

                  b)   the banks’ Boards and senior management understand the limitations and uncertainties
                       relating to the output of the models and the risk inherent in their use; and
                  c)   banks perform regular and independent validation and testing of the models
                  d)   The supervisor assesses whether the model outputs appear reasonable as a reflection
                       of the risks assumed.

Description and   There are 3 different communiques regarding standards for models used to measure
findings re EC6   market risk, credit risk and operational risk: Communiqué on the Calculation of Market Risk
                  by Risk Measurement Models and Assessment of Risk Measurement Model (CMR-RMM),
                  Communiqué on Calculation of the Risk Weighted Exposure Amount for Credit Risk by
                  Internal-rating based Approaches (CIRB), Communiqué on Calculation of the Risk Weighted
                  Exposure Amount for Operational Risk by Advanced Measurement Approach (CAMA)
                  respectively. Additionally, there are Guidelines on Assessment and Validation of Internal
                  Rating Based Approaches and Advanced Measurement Approach (GAVA) and Guidelines on
                  the Application Process of Internal Rating Based Approaches and Advanced Measurement
                  Approach (GAPA) guidelines regarding approval and validations processes for these
                  models. These guidelines regulate the model use for regulatory capital requirement
                  calculation purposes.

                  RICAAP has rules about model use for internal risk management purposes. RICAAP Article
                  5(2) (ğ) gives responsibility to the Board to have information about risks the bank is
                  exposed to and measurement methods and management of those.

                  It is mentioned in the Articles 42, 45(2)(ç), 55(1) of the RICAAP that different measurement
                  methods and models may be used to measure and assess risks. In these articles there are
                  detailed information about the processes related to method or model.

                  Regulation states that banks’ internal audit units are given the responsibility to audit risk
                  measurement models. If risk measurement models are used in the bank, the internal audit
                  unit should audit: whether the results obtained from risk measurement models and
                  methods are incorporated in daily risk management, the accuracy of data and assumptions
                  used in risk measurement models, reliability, integrity and timely availability of the data
                  source used and the accuracy of back-tests used for these models, etc. (Article 21(4) of the
                  RICAAP).

                  The responsibility of the risk management department is “to participate in the process of
                  designing, selecting and putting into practice the risk measurement models and giving
                  preliminary approval, to review the models regularly and to make the necessary changes”.
                  Article 41(1)(d), (e) of RICAAP.

                  RICAAP imposes separate roles to different internal system units regarding risk
                  measurement models. Article 11(2)(b) requires that the information systems of the bank
                  shall enable risks, including regulatory and internal capital adequacy calculations, to be
                  measured using risk measurement methods or models and to be reported in a timely and
                  effective manner. Article 15(2)(ç) gives internal control units the responsibility to interrogate




                                                                                                                113

                  the accuracy of transaction details, activities, and outputs related to risk management
                  models.

                  Article 58 and 62 of the RICAAP arranges validation process of the internal model. The
                  validation process to be made within the scope of Article 58 is assessed by the BRSA.
                  According to article 58, validation of internal model used within the scope of ICAAP shall be
                  made by a team independent from the units which develops methodology or independent
                  from the executive units. Validation may be conducted by external experts. Validation
                  report should be submitted to BRSA together with ICAAP report (Article 63(9)). In addition
                  to the RICAAP, GICAAPR has numerous detailed provisions connected to the models or
                  methods as well as validation processes of them.

                  Additionally, model risk is highlighted in risk management guidelines such as in Guideline
                  on The Management of Concentration Risk (GMCR).

                  GAA, para 8, states that the Agency examines the regulatory capital adequacy and
                  calculation process, models and assumptions. In paragraph 10, the issues that the bank
                  considers while using the IRB approach are listed. According to paragraph 12, the Agency
                  examines the internal capital adequacy and calculation process, models and assumptions
                  that are used by banks.

                  The BRSA examiners examine compliance to the above mentioned regulations. To examine
                  these processes, the BRSA examiners use GAR (risk assessment – CAMELS) module

EC7               The supervisor determines that banks have information systems that are adequate (both
                  under normal circumstances and in periods of stress) for measuring, assessing and
                  reporting on the size, composition and quality of exposures on a bank-wide basis across all
                  risk types, products and counterparties. The supervisor also determines that these reports
                  reflect the bank’s risk profile and capital and liquidity needs, and are provided on a timely
                  basis to the bank’s Board and senior management in a form suitable for their use.

Description and   Article 11 of RICAAP addresses information systems. The structure of information systems
findings re EC7   must be commensurate with the scale of the bank and with nature and complexity of the
                  products. The minimum outputs of these systems are regulated in RICAAP including
                  regulatory and internal capital adequacy calculations, early warning indicators, timely
                  reporting of breaches of maximum risk levels, allocation of capital requirement according to
                  risk level, stress tests and scenario analysis to be made, etc. Also Article 45 gives
                  information about reporting of risks within the bank.

                  RICAAP regulates the general requirements about information systems, however, in the risk
                  management guidelines that are listed in Principle 1, EC3, there are additional specific
                  requirements imposed regarding that specific risk. For example, Paragraphs 44-51 of
                  Guideline for Liquidity Risk Management (GLRM) explains how an information system for
                  liquidity risk management should be. GAA paragraphs 12(8), 12(11) mention about
                  management information systems and reporting.

                      Banks’ reporting framework comprises of a wide range of call reports on several aspects of
                      prudential importance, some of which pertain to the consolidated bank position. Banks are
                      obliged to prepare the ICAAP report annually both on a consolidated basis and non-
                      consolidated basis. Within the ICAAP report, the results of stress tests and scenario analyses
                      must be presented. Banks’ reporting is subjected to test checks by the BRSA. Periodical
                      internal systems audit conducted by external auditors and the BRSA provide assurance
                      about the integrity and coverage of the internal and supervisory reports.

                      BRSA sets the standards for information systems of banks in CPITMB, RICAAP, and GICAAP
                      and conducts IT examinations via its IT audit experts. Furthermore, annual external audit
                      findings are utilized to evaluate the IT risks associated with a bank as well. Bank’s Board and
                      senior management make self-assessments using Circular on Management Assertion and
                      submit their assessments to the external auditor.

                      Through the CAMELS review/GAR methodology, under MIS in the Management component
                      —the BRSA examiners assess whether banks have adequate information systems for
                      measuring, assessing and reporting on the size, composition and quality of exposures on a
                      bank-wide basis across all risk types. Through this process and procedure, they are to assess
                      whether these reports reflect the bank’s risk profile and capital and liquidity needs, and are
                      provided on a timely basis to the bank’s top management.

                      Furthermore, according to GAA paragraph 12(8); during the ICAAP examinations, the
                      Agency assesses the quality of the bank’s management information reporting and systems,
                      the manner in which business risks and activities are aggregated, and management’s record
                      in response to emerging or changing risks.

EC8                   The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies and processes to ensure that
                      the banks’ Boards and senior management understand the risks inherent in new products, 38
                      material modifications to existing products, and major management initiatives (such as
                      changes in systems, processes, business model and major acquisitions). The supervisor
                      determines that the Boards and senior management are able to monitor and manage these
                      risks on an ongoing basis. The supervisor also determines that the bank’s policies and
                      processes require the undertaking of any major activities of this nature to be approved by
                      their Board or a specific committee of the Board.

Description and       RICAAP Article 5(2) points (ğ) and (ö) give the Board the responsibility to have information
findings re EC8       about risks the bank is exposed and to understand the risks of new products. Board is also
                      given the responsibility to approve all policies and processes according to article 5(2) (i) and
                      best practice guidelines. Article 40 requires banks to carefully assess new products and
                      services offered by them. Banks are required to ensure that the necessary personnel,
                      technology and financial resources are available for these products and services to be
                      offered and that the top management is fully aware of the risks involved in the new
                      products and services. Also in article 18 of the RICAAP it is stated that new transactions and



38 New   products include those developed by the bank or by a third party and purchased or distributed by the bank.



                                                                                                                 115

                  products should be included in the compliance controls carried out by the internal control
                  units of banks.

                  While Article 40 enumerates a number of the review requirements for new products, it does
                  not explicitly extend the process to address material modifications to existing products and
                  major acquisitions. It also does not require banks to restrict new products if they do not
                  have the necessary controls, management, and resources to manage related risks.

                  In addition to this, BRSA is able to verify compliance to these regulations as part of its
                  CAMELS rating methodology under the Management component during on-site
                  examinations. For example, Financial Soundness Analysis Identification Number (FSAID)
                  2753 supports this examination.

EC9               The supervisor determines that banks have risk management functions covering all material
                  risks with sufficient resources, independence, authority and access to the banks’ Boards to
                  perform their duties effectively. The supervisor determines that their duties are clearly
                  segregated from risk-taking functions in the bank and that they report on risk exposures
                  directly to the Board and senior management. The supervisor also determines that the risk
                  management function is subject to regular review by the internal audit function.

Description and   BL (Article 31) stipulates that the risk management activities shall be performed by the risk
findings re EC9   management department which will work under the board of directors. RICAAP Article 4 (2)
                  also requires internal systems to be located under the board of directors. It furthermore
                  requires the board of directors to determine the duties, powers and responsibilities of the
                  internal systems units and of their managers clearly and without conflict of duties, to
                  approve the working procedures and principles for the staff appointed in these units, and to
                  ensure that the necessary resources are allocated.

                  Article 10(1) of RICAAP, provides information for the division of risk management
                  functions/tasks in banks. Moreover, the BRSA verifies the independence of the risk
                  management functions and recommend remedial measures if it is not observed.

                  In periodic and risk-based audits, the department audits the adequacy and effectiveness of
                  the internal control and risk management systems and ICAAP is assessed by the internal
                  audit unit. Additionally, the ICAAP report is also examined by the BRSA examiners.

                  The BCP team identified certain issues with the organization of the credit risk management
                  function and the credit monitoring function which is a line management activity. The
                  organizational arrangements discussed in BCP 17 do not adequately address independent
                  credit risk monitoring at the individual credit and portfolio levels. See BCP 17.

EC10              The supervisor requires larger and more complex banks to have a dedicated risk
                  management unit overseen by a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or equivalent function. If the CRO
                  of a bank is removed from his/her position for any reason, this should be done with the
                  prior approval of the Board and generally should be disclosed publicly. The bank should
                  also discuss the reasons for such removal with its supervisor.

Description and    In Turkey, risk management departments of banks are separate units that are directly under
findings re EC10   the board of directors. According to the Article 31 of BL, risk management activities shall be
                   performed by the risk management department and personnel to work under the board of
                   directors.

                   RICAAP Article 4 directs that banks assign a senior manager or an executive vice president,
                   responsible for all internal systems departments, who has no hierarchical link with the CEO
                   in the bank’s organization structure and whose assessments on performance as well as
                   financial and personal rights are conducted by the board of directors or the audit
                   committee. Also the articles 37(1) and 41(3) have provisions regarding risk management
                   unit and personnel.

                   In Turkey, the risk management departments of banks are generally organized under a
                   senior manager reporting directly to audit committee. However, some banks do have CRO
                   type posts. Commensurate with their size and complexity of operations, banks should be
                   specifically required to have qualified CROs with sufficient stature, position and authority
                   within the organization to oversee risk management activities. The level of senior manager
                   may not provide the necessary stature necessary to challenge high level risk decisions and
                   processes.

                   According to RICAAP article 63(1), banks must notify the Agency in writing of the
                   appointment or resignation of the internal systems manager or committee members, the
                   members of the audit committee, and the senior managers of the units included within the
                   scope of these systems, within seven working days from the date of the relevant decision.
                   However, regulation should require, explicitly, if the CRO is removed from his/her position
                   for any reason, that the Board has been informed and has given its approval. This action
                   should be generally disclosed publicly. While the regulation requires banks to notify the
                   BRSA promptly, the reasons for such removal should be presented and discussed.

EC11               The supervisor issues standards related to, in particular, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk,
                   interest rate risk in the banking book and operational risk.

Description and    BRSA has issued detailed specific guidelines articulating the standards related to credit risk,
findings re EC11   market risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, country
                   risk, reputational risk, and others.

EC12               The supervisor requires banks to have appropriate contingency arrangements, as an integral
                   part of their risk management process, to address risks that may materialize and actions to
                   be taken in stress conditions (including those that will pose a serious risk to their viability). If
                   warranted by its risk profile and systemic importance, the contingency arrangements
                   include robust and credible recovery plans that take into account the specific circumstances
                   of the bank. The supervisor, working with resolution authorities as appropriate, assesses the
                   adequacy of banks’ contingency arrangements in the light of their risk profile and systemic
                   importance (including reviewing any recovery plans) and their likely feasibility during
                   periods of stress. The supervisor seeks improvements if deficiencies are identified.

Description and    RICAAP Article 13 addresses the emergency and contingency plans and business continuity
findings re EC12   management. Banks must establish a business continuity management structure approved
                   by the board of directors in order to ensure the sustainability of activities in case of an
                   interruption or to save them time to minimize operational, financial, legal and reputational
                   negative effects. There are also other provisions at RICAAP Article 13 that address payment
                   and settlement systems and business disruption. For a possible emergency and contingency
                   regarding the payment and settlement systems, communication arrangements shall be
                   established between the authorities of the CBRT, the persons responsible for the interbank
                   payments, agreements and settlement systems and the Agency as well as a communication
                   channel or network open to the public and the customers. The continuity of information
                   systems is handled in information systems continuity plan approved by the board of
                   directors prepared within the scope of business continuity plan and in state of emergency
                   and contingency plan. Banks have to mention their contingency arrangements in their
                   ICAAP reports. Please refer to GICAAPR Annex section 6, paragraphs (1, 3, and 4), section 8
                   paragraph 4, section 9 paragraphs (2, 3, and 5(7)).

                   Provisions regarding business continuity plans are further regulated in GORM in a more
                   detailed manner. According to GORM Principle 10, banks need to have a business
                   continuity plan to be able to continue their activities on an ongoing basis and limit losses in
                   the event of severe business disruption.

                   Negative condition scenarios created by the bank should be assessed for their financial,
                   operational and reputational impact and the resulting risk assessment should be the
                   foundation for recovery priorities and objectives (paragraph 71 of GORM).

                   All the disaster recovery and business continuity plans are tested at least once in a year
                   according to RICAAP article 13. These tests are checked by the BRSA on-site examination
                   teams as a part of the ratings process. This includes whether there is a business continuity
                   plan approved by the board of directors and if this plan is tested by the bank.

EC13               The supervisor requires banks to have forward-looking stress testing programs,
                   commensurate with their risk profile and systemic importance, as an integral part of their
                   risk management process. The supervisor regularly assesses a bank’s stress testing program
                   and determines that it captures material sources of risk and adopts plausible adverse
                   scenarios. The supervisor also determines that the bank integrates the results into its
                   decision-making, risk management processes (including contingency arrangements) and
                   the assessment of its capital and liquidity levels. Where appropriate, the scope of the
                   supervisor’s assessment includes the extent to which the stress testing program:

                   a)   promotes risk identification and control, on a bank-wide basis
                   b)   adopts suitably severe assumptions and seeks to address feedback effects and system-
                        wide interaction between risks;
                   c)   benefits from the active involvement of the Board and senior management; and
                   d)   is appropriately documented and regularly maintained and updated.

                   The supervisor requires corrective action if material deficiencies are identified in a bank’s
                   stress testing program or if the results of stress tests are not adequately taken into
                   consideration in the bank’s decision-making process

Description and    RICAAP Article 43 stipulates that Banks shall establish and operate a stress testing program
findings re EC13   in order to measure its material risks and vulnerabilities which may arise from both negative
                   developments peculiar to the bank and the developments in stressed economic and
                   financial environment. Top management is responsible for establishment and
                   implementation of a stress testing program as a whole. In addition to this, stress testing
                   program shall be based on historical data including statistical risk and loss predictions and
                   complementary for other risk management methods and qualitative implementations.
                   Stress testing program shall include clearly defined purposes, well designed scenarios in
                   compliance with the bank's activities and its risk arising from those activities, written
                   assumptions, a strong methodology, reporting supporting the decisions taken, revising
                   stress testing processes in a continuous and efficient manner and management actions
                   based on stress testing results. Stress testing program requires, an overall firm-wide stress
                   testing, in addition to each material risk type.

                   Consistent with RICAAP Article 43(7), a Guideline on Stress Testing to be used by Banks In
                   Capital and Liquidity Planning (GST) was published. GST is arranged to determine the
                   principles on the implementation of the mentioned article and banks are expected to be in
                   compliance to the extent with their structures, size and complexity of the Bank’s activities.
                   Principles stated in the guideline also make a base for supervision and surveillance activities
                   of the Agency. Within the scope of GST, stress testing defines all the implementations
                   enabling the forward-looking evaluation of possible events or changes that could adversely
                   impact the bank.

                   During the examinations conducted, BRSA reviews the key assumptions driving stress
                   testing results and their continuing relevance in view of existing and potentially changing
                   market conditions. BRSA evaluates banks on how stress testing is used in internal processes
                   of banks and the way it affects decision-making.

EC14               The supervisor assesses whether banks appropriately account for risks (including liquidity
                   impacts) in their internal pricing, performance measurement and new product approval
                   process for all significant business activities.

Description and    Article 40 of RICAAP states that the top management should be fully aware of the risks
findings re EC14   involved in the new products and services. The bank must ensure that detailed assessment
                   of the risks that may arise from the product or service, determination of the necessary
                   resources to assess risk management practices and carry out effective risk management for
                   the new product or service, implementation procedures to be followed in measuring,
                   monitoring and controlling the risks that would arise from the new product or service are
                   taken into account when a new product is offered.

Additional
criteria

AC1                  The supervisor requires banks to have appropriate policies and processes for assessing
                     other material risks not directly addressed in the subsequent Principles, such as reputational
                     and strategic risks.

Assessment of        Largely Compliant
Principle 15

Comments             The RICAAP forms a part of the core of the BRSA’s regulatory framework for risk
                     management. Given that the ICAAP is a relatively recent requirement, banks’ are still
                     developing their approach and implementing important systems. The BCP team’s review of
                     supervisors’ working papers and discussion with banks indicated that banks as well as
                     supervisors are, in fact, in a learning phase. The quality of banks reports and the scrutiny of
                     the reports by supervisors will need to develop further before the results can be more
                     reliably and more extensively used.

                     Commensurate with their size and complexity of operations, banks should be specifically
                     required to have qualified CROs with sufficient stature, position and authority within the
                     organization to oversee risk management activities. The level of senior manager may not
                     provide the necessary stature necessary to challenge high level risk decisions and processes.

                     As well, while there are comprehensive requirements for the evaluation of new products,
                     parameters should be expanded to explicitly address material modifications to existing
                     products and major acquisitions. It should also direct banks to restrict such products or
                     activities if they do not have the necessary controls, management, and resources to manage
                     related risks.

Principle 16         Capital adequacy. 39 The supervisor sets prudent and appropriate capital adequacy
                     requirements for banks that reflect the risks undertaken by, and presented by, a bank in the
                     context of the markets and macroeconomic conditions in which it operates. The supervisor
                     defines the components of capital, bearing in mind their ability to absorb losses. At least for
                     internationally active banks, capital requirements are not less than the applicable Basel
                     standards.

Essential criteria

EC 1                 Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to calculate and consistently observe
                     prescribed capital requirements, including thresholds by reference to which a bank might



39The Core Principles do not require a jurisdiction to comply with the capital adequacy regimes of Basel I, Basel II
and/or Basel III. The Committee does not consider implementation of the Basel-based framework a prerequisite for
compliance with the Core Principles, and compliance with one of the regimes is only required of those jurisdictions
that have declared that they have voluntarily implemented it.

                     be subject to supervisory action. Laws, regulations or the supervisor define the qualifying
                     components of capital, ensuring that emphasis is given to those elements of capital
                     permanently available to absorb losses on a going concern basis.

Description and      According to Article 45 of the BL all banks in Turkey need to hold a capital adequacy ratio
findings re EC1      (CAR) of at least 8%. The BL also authorizes the BRSB to increase the minimum CAR, to set
                     different ratios for each bank and to revise the risk weight assets after taking into
                     consideration the banks’ internal systems as well as their asset and financial structures.

                     Using these powers the BRSA has implemented a capital framework in compliance with
                     Basel standards. For the regulatory minimum capital requirement, the BRSA sets the
                     minimum standard for CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital on a solo and consolidated level
                     according to the Basel requirements, which are 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0% of risk-weighted assets,
                     respectively, and, as a parallel requirement, the BRSA also sets a targeted minimum total
                     capital ratio of 12% of risk-weighted assets. Minimum levels are defined in the RCA (art. 29
                     and 30) while ROF defines the elements of regulatory capital.

                     Banks are also required to maintain a capital planning buffer above the minimum amounts
                     based in their internal capital assessment and planning (RICAAP, art. 55 and 60).

EC2                  At least for internationally active banks, 40 the definition of capital, the risk coverage, the
                     method of calculation and thresholds for the prescribed requirements are not lower than
                     those established in the applicable Basel standards.

Description and      The BRSA applies the Basel Framework on a consolidated basis to all credit institutions in
findings re EC2      Turkey, including credit banks and participation banks. The capital framework is mostly
                     established in the Regulation on Own Funds (ROF) and in the Regulation of Measurement
                     and Assessment of Capital Adequacy in Banks (RCA) and is in compliance with Basel
                     Standards.

                     Some aspects of the regulation are more rigorous than the Basel framework. Turkish
                     legislation, for instance, applies a more conservative approach in assigning risk weights
                     based on ratings for exposures to corporates. All domestically incorporated corporates are
                     subject to a risk weight of at least 100%. The floors applied to the IRB and AMA framework
                     are also more conservative than the ones prescribed by Basel, although currently there is no
                     bank authorized to calculate regulatory requirements following these approaches

                     Given the low materiality of securitization exposures in the Turkish banking system, the
                     BRSA has not implemented the internal ratings-based approach for securitization.




40 The Basel Capital Accord was designed to apply to internationally active banks, which must calculate and apply

capital adequacy ratios on a consolidated basis, including subsidiaries undertaking banking and financial business.
Jurisdictions adopting the Basel II and Basel III capital adequacy frameworks would apply such ratios on a fully
consolidated basis to all internationally active banks and their holding companies; in addition, supervisors must test
that banks are adequately capitalized on a stand-alone basis.

                                                                                                          (continued)

                     The BRSA capital framework has been assessed as compliant by the Basel Committee
                     Regulatory Assessment Program

EC3                  The supervisor has the power to impose a specific capital charge and/or limits on all
                     material risk exposures, if warranted, including in respect of risks that the supervisor
                     considers not to have been adequately transferred or mitigated through transactions (e.g.,
                     securitization transactions) 41 entered into by the bank. Both on-balance sheet and off-
                     balance sheet risks are included in the calculation of prescribed capital requirements.

Description and      Article 45 of BL provide the BRSB the power to increase the minimum CAR and to set
findings re EC3      different ratios for each bank after taking into consideration the banks’ internal systems as
                     well as their asset and financial structures.

                     In practice specific capital charges are established in the ICAAP and SREP review. The
                     RICAAP Section 5 (ICAAP) requires banks to assess their capital needs, estimate capital
                     charges for Pillar 2 risks and estimate a capital planning buffer based on stress scenario for
                     the following three years. Banks are required to maintain a higher level than the amount
                     estimated internally. The BRSA examines the ICAAP report and in case missing parts or
                     errors are found, a new ICRR can be determined. Article 60 of the RICAAP also allows the
                     BRSA to increase capital requirements if it considers that banks are not holding sufficient
                     capital for Pillar1 and Pillar2 risks.

                     The regulation imposed by the BRSA is complex and difficult to enforce. Banks are allowed
                     to use models to calculate the internal capital charge for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 risks, to
                     consider risk diversification benefits, and are provided a few constraints on the projections
                     of their capital needs for the following years under stress. In addition to that, the specific
                     capital charge may not be binding for several banks. Since the capital planning buffer is
                     only applied when the results are higher than the capital conservation buffer, it is likely to
                     fade in importance over the next few years as the capital conservation buffer will be fully
                     phased-in. The 12% total capital parallel requirement imposed by the BRSA might also be
                     the effective binding constraint for a number of banks.

EC4                  The prescribed capital requirements reflect the risk profile and systemic importance of
                     banks 42 in the context of the markets and macroeconomic conditions in which they operate
                     and constrain the build-up of leverage in banks and the banking sector. Laws and
                     regulations in a particular jurisdiction may set higher overall capital adequacy standards
                     than the applicable Basel requirements.

measurement and capital standards: a revised framework, comprehensive version, June 2006.
42In assessing the adequacy of a bank’s capital levels in light of its risk profile, the supervisor critically focuses,
among other things, on (a) the potential loss absorbency of the instruments included in the bank’s capital base, (b)
the appropriateness of risk weights as a proxy for the risk profile of its exposures, (c) the adequacy of provisions and
reserves to cover loss expected on its exposures and (d) the quality of its risk management and controls.
Consequently, capital requirements may vary from bank to bank to ensure that each bank is operating with the
appropriate level of capital to support the risks it is running and the risks it poses.

Description and   As explained in EC3, the BL authorizes the BRSA board to increase the minimum capital
findings re EC4   adequacy ratio and to set different ratios for each bank taking into consideration the banks’
                  internal systems as well as their asset and financial structures. The BRSA does that in
                  practice through the ICAAP.

                  Systemic importance is taken into account imposing additional loss absorbency
                  requirements for domestic systemically important banks. The BRSA methodology is similar
                  to the one used by the FSB to identify and group G-SIBs. The regulation creates four groups
                  of banks as shown in the table below and distributes the banks in the groups according to
                  their systemic importance. Seven banks are expected to populate the bottom three groups
                  of the table.

                                    Groups                      Domestic Systemically
                                                                Important Banks (D-SIBs)
                                                                Buffer rates (%)

                  Macroeconomic conditions are taken into account through the countercyclical capital
                  buffer. Following the Basel guidance, the BRSA’s capital framework prescribes a process
                  whereby both national and cross-border conditions are taken into account. The national
                  component of the buffer is currently set at zero. BRSA has established indicators and a
                  process for monitoring the macroeconomic conditions in Turkey and update this value as
                  needed. Banks should obtain the value of the foreign component of the buffer for each
                  country where they contain exposures from the Basel Committee website.

                  Another tool implemented by the BRSA to limit leverage in the banking system is the
                  leverage ratio. The regulation on Measurement and Assessment of Leverage Level of Banks
                  (RMAL) establishes that the three-month simple arithmetic average of the leverage ratio
                  should be at least three percent. The RMAL also provides the BRSB the power to establishes
                  a different leverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio by considering the internal
                  systems, asset and financial structures of banks, the implementation of different ratio on the
                  basis of the bank and change the calculation and reporting periods.

                  As explained in EC2, some aspects of the regulation set by the BRSA are more rigorous than
                  the Basel framework. Turkish legislation, for instance, applies a more conservative approach
                  in assigning risk weights based on ratings for the exposures to corporates. The BRSA also
                  applies a parallel 12% capital adequacy ratio requirement.

EC5               The use of banks’ internal assessments of risk as inputs to the calculation of regulatory
                  capital is approved by the supervisor. If the supervisor approves such use:

                  a)   such assessments adhere to rigorous qualifying standards;



                                                                                                              123

                     b)   any cessation of such use, or any material modification of the bank’s processes and
                          models for producing such internal assessments, are subject to the approval of the
                          supervisor;
                     c)   the supervisor has the capacity to evaluate a bank’s internal assessment process in
                          order to determine that the relevant qualifying standards are met and that the bank’s
                          internal assessments can be relied upon as a reasonable reflection of the risks
                          undertaken;
                     d)   the supervisor has the power to impose conditions on its approvals if the supervisor
                          considers it prudent to do so; and
                     e)   if a bank does not continue to meet the qualifying standards or the conditions imposed
                          by the supervisor on an ongoing basis, the supervisor has the power to revoke its
                          approval.

Description and      Currently there is no bank in Turkey authorized to use modeling approaches to calculate
findings re EC5      the Pillar 1 capital charge.

                     The use of internal models for calculating regulatory capital requirements is subject to BRSA
                     approval (RCA, Articles 4, 9 and 24). The approval process to use internal assessments for
                     various risk types are set out in related communiqués such as CIRB, CAMA, CMR-RMM.

                     Some large domestic banks and subsidiaries of international banks, are already using
                     models for their internal risk management and lending process. These banks are in the
                     process of calibrating and adjusting those models in order to appropriately capture the
                     risks of the local market, before submitting them for regulatory approval by the BRSA.
                     Some banks are expected to apply for the IRB approach.

                     The regulatory framework set out numerous requirements for banks utilizing internal
                     models approaches. CIRB, CAMA and CMR-RMM set qualifying standards for credit risk,
                     operational risk and market risk in accordance to the Basel II framework. The BRSA has a
                     number of risk management specialists that are able to provide support during the
                     authorization process.

                     According to the regulation, material modifications to the risk system after the
                     authorization process require new BRSA approval. If a bank does not continue to meet the
                     qualifying standards or the conditions imposed by the BRSA on an ongoing basis, the BRSA
                     has the power to revoke its approval according to CIRB, CAMA, and CMR-RMM.

EC6                  The supervisor has the power to require banks to adopt a forward-looking approach to
                     capital management (including the conduct of appropriate stress testing). 43 The supervisor
                     has the power to require banks:

                     a)   to set capital levels and manage available capital in anticipation of possible events or
                          changes in market conditions that could have an adverse effect; and



43 “Stress testing” comprises a range of activities from simple sensitivity analysis to more complex scenario analyses

and reverses stress testing.

                         b)   to have in place feasible contingency arrangements to maintain or strengthen capital
                              positions in times of stress, as appropriate in the light of the risk profile and systemic
                              importance of the bank.
Description and          RICAAP Articles 46-62 have detailed provisions concerning the ICAAP processes and
findings re EC6          reporting of banks. In particular, banks should have a risk based, comprehensive and
                         forward-looking capital assessment processes which should include all the risks on a
                         consolidated basis.

                         In particular, as discussed in EC3, banks are required to hold a capital planning buffer that is
                         based on stress tests. Banks are required to project the evolution of their RWA and capital
                         for the following three years under different stress scenarios. The methodology generates a
                         capital charge associated with the lowest capital buffer in any one of these years.

                         Finally, banks are required to discuss and provide information on contingency
                         arrangements to maintain their capital positions in times of stress as part of the ICAAP
                         reports (GICAAPR).

AC1                      For non-internationally active banks, capital requirements, including the definition of
                         capital, the risk coverage, the method of calculation, the scope of application and the
                         capital required, are broadly consistent with the principles of the applicable Basel standards
                         relevant to internationally active banks.

Assessment of            Compliant
Principle 16

Comments                 The BRSA has adopted the various components of Basel II, 2.5 and III according to the
                         framework established by the Basel Committee. Capital is calculated on a consolidated and
                         solo basis for all banks and the BRSA has the authority to impose additional capital
                         requirements on individual banks, as deemed necessary. The BRSA has applied the three
                         Basel ratios (common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total capital) as well as countercyclical capital
                         requirements, systemic important bank capital add-ons and a “capital planning buffer” that
                         provides a forward looking nature to the capital regulation.

                         Going forward, as the BRSA gain experience with the ICAAP, it should consider
                         simplifications to the framework to improve its enforceability and reduce banks compliance
                         burden, particularly for non-systemic important banks. Simplifications that could be

                        market and operational risk that have not been authorized for the Pillar 1 capital charge.
                        The BRSA should also evaluate the interaction with other requirements such as the 12%
                        parallel capital charge and the Basel capital buffers to prevent the effectiveness of the Pillar
                        2 regime from being damaged by another more stringent requirement that in practice
                        makes the Pillar 2 charges redundant.

                        and macroeconomic conditions. This includes prudent policies and processes to identify,
                        measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate credit risk 46 (including
                        counterparty credit risk) 47 on a timely basis. The full credit lifecycle is covered including
                        credit underwriting, credit evaluation, and the ongoing management of the bank’s loan
                        and investment portfolios.

Essential criteria

EC1                     Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have appropriate credit risk
                        management processes that provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of credit risk
                        exposures. The supervisor determines that the processes are consistent with the risk
                        appetite, risk profile, systemic importance and capital strength of the bank, take into
                        account market and macroeconomic conditions and result in prudent standards of credit
                        underwriting, evaluation, administration and monitoring.

Description and         Article 23 of the BL assigns direct responsibility to the board of directors for “ensuring the
findings re EC1         establishment, functionality, appropriateness, and adequacy of internal control, risk
                        management, and internal audit inconformity with the applicable legislation; securing
                        financial reporting systems; and specification of the powers and responsibilities within the
                        bank”. The Article 29 of the BL states that the banks are obliged to establish and operate
                        adequate and efficient internal control, risk management and internal audit systems that
                        are in harmony with the scope and structure of their activities.

                        The definition of a “loan” is provided articles 48 and article 50 and provides a
                        comprehensive list of the prudential standards and limitations for extending loans to the
                        risk group of the bank. Article 51 and article 52 of the BL includes the framework
                        regarding credit administration and monitoring.

                        Standards of credit underwriting, evaluation, administration and monitoring are further
                        enumerated in the Guideline on Credit Management of Banks (GCM). It states that the

capital strength of a bank; that the processes should take market and macroeconomic
conditions into account and result in prudent standards of credit underwriting, evaluation,
administration and monitoring. Additionally, there is a separate Guideline on Counterparty
Credit Risk Management (GCPRM).

In addition to the credit risk management provisions described above, the GCM defines
‘credit management’. It includes the areas of credit marketing, credit granting, and credit
monitoring. The GCM states that certain organizational structures in the credit area should
avoid conflicts of interest that may be caused by units reporting to the same vice general
manager that are involved in credit monitoring and tracking together with credit
marketing and credit granting. The GCM also addresses certain MIS requirements,
conformity with limits, and management of collateral. The following provides a description
of the organization of the 2 functions of (credit) risk management and credit monitoring
as conveyed to the assessor team.

Credit Risk Oversight Organization

Credit oversight is laid out in a two-fold manner.

1.            (Credit) Risk Management

The board is charged with effective risk management and organizationally, such a unit
must fall directly under it. As such, the unit falls under the audit committee as an
extension of the board.

The “legal” independence of this unit is expected via RICAAP which enumerates in detail
the responsibilities of the board including determining its organizational structure,
strategies, as well as human resource considerations. In this regard the board is
responsible for the appointment and dismissal of unit managers and training of staff.

This unit conducts a variety of risk management activities including credit
portfolio/exposure surveillance. However, it does not conduct evaluation of individual
credits to determine their internal classification status (standard, special mention,
substandard, doubtful, loss). It takes this information generated from the “risk
management function”, a management line function, as source data from which to
calculate relevant trend information. It adds to that other analysis to monitor higher level
trends and issues that management and the board should receive. Some of the
information generated at this level includes:

•    Internal limits and ratios

•    Legal limits and ratios

•    Individual borrower limits

•    Sector concentration limits

•    NPLs figures (received from the credit review department)




                                                                                          127
TURKEY



         •    Recent trends and developments in the portfolio(s) taking into account market and
              macroeconomic information

         This type of information, at this level, will first go to the audit committee and then to the
         full board.

         Among other things, this department is also typically responsible for monitoring the
         overall risk trends in the bank, designing the risk rating system used by the
         management/business lines, policies and procedures, model development for credit
         approval processes, review of model validations conducted elsewhere in the bank, etc.
         However, no work or analysis is conducted at the individual credit level.

         2.            Credit Monitoring Function (line management department/unit)

         This unit is a management line function as are the marketing and underwriting functions.
         The later 2 are involved in credit origination, analysis, approvals (according to delegated
         loan authorities and controls), and administration.

         The credit monitoring function represents management’s execution of their responsibility
         to monitor the business risk they put on the books of the bank. The business line (should
         be) is the party responsible for first identifying and flagging credit risk deterioration. If
         accomplished in a timely manner, this allows early intervention and possible rectification
         of potential credit problems.

         Credit risk monitoring starts as soon as the subject loan is granted and consists of
         monitoring:

         •    Past due status of the borrowers

         •    Change in system generated risk ratings

         •    Collateral status and coverage

         •    Customer limits

         •    Risk Center monitoring for developing borrower(s) trends

         •    Opines on restructuring loans

         •    Deteriorating credit as detected from past due information

         In general, once a credit hits NPL status, it is sent to the loan work-out unit for more active
         management.

         This unit provides the source data on, intern alia, individual deteriorating/NPL credits and
         NPL trend data on homogeneous credits to the board via the risk management function
         described above. Such data are management reports which may have more current (and
         different) classifications of credit than the system generates due to the timing of
         information input to the system.

         The BRSA also conveyed that the internal audit function plays an important role in the
         credit risk management framework. Audits in the credit areas are intended to determine




128
                                                                                       TURKEY



whether the credit process is consistent with board approved policies and procedures and
the accuracy of management reports, and board and audit committee reports. As
well, the BRSA added that loan review is the most prevalent activity in the internal
audit plan(s).
According to REPL, banks are required to review their loan portfolio in terms of
classification at least quarterly and they are required to document those reviewed
for the largest 200 loans (or the ones above 250.000 TL). The BRSA indicated that
the loan review documentation for the largest 200 loans is usually prepared by
internal audit.
The BRSA, in its credit portfolio reviews, determines the extent to which internal bank
ratings are automatically generated, both the homogeneous portfolios as well as the
larger, individual credit exposures. The examiners review and use both management
problem loan reports and the system generated reports during portfolio inspections.

The credit risk management oversight (line management function) and credit risk
management function and the organization therein create loopholes in the independence
and integrity of credit risk monitoring and reporting to bank boards and the BRSA. Key
observations on the credit risk oversight organization:

•   Based on this design, which may vary in practice from institution to institution, the
    board has indeed established a (credit) risk management unit that complies with the
    letter of the law. Through this mechanism, the unit is able to provide high level trend
    and other analysis information.

However, there is no ongoing, independent credit risk monitoring of large individual
exposures or homogeneous portfolios. Important source data (identification of
deteriorating credits that have not yet reached an NPL status—as well as special mention
credit and status of NPLs) is generated by the credit monitoring unit which is a business
line management function. This information is also reported to the BRSA for monitoring
and examination purposes.

•   There is no independent verification (i.e., independent loan review function)
    that determines that 1) management identification processes are accurate
    and timely, 2) management, itself, is accurately recognizing its business risk,
    and 3) timely borrower intervention is activated.
•   This critical input forms the basis of important MIS going to the board.

•   Examiners, through their inspection process, have identified important, clearly
    inaccurate classifications of credit that could easily indicate key issues with 1-3 above.
    However, the significance of these inaccurate classifications was not clear from the
    examination samples reviewed. Consistently, there was no indication of the size of the
    sample of reviewed credits, how significant the aggregate, inaccurately classified
    credit was to the total portfolio, and if such findings could be extrapolated to the
    entire portfolio.




                                                                                            129

                      GCM Principle 9 presents the activities of units included in the bank’s internal systems
                      (internal audit, risk management, compliance). Banks are to make “internal controls”
                      (internal audits) with the objective to assess credit management processes, determine
                      compliance with legal and bank limits, and to avoid deterioration in the credit portfolio.
                      Activities, at a minimum, include: periodically assess the largest 200 credits of the bank
                      which have the highest risks, test adequacy of collateral, assess the adequacy and accuracy
                      of credit files; test non-performing loan identification; and assess the risk arising from
                      exceptional operations. The activity also is to determine compliance with credit policies
                      and procedures including authorizations, maturity, quality, and reporting to senior
                      management.

                      Results of internal systems’ (risk management, internal audit) reviews are to be shared with
                      senior management and the audit committee. The GCM goes on to indicate that banks
                      establish an internal ratings system to manage credit risk. Retail customers are monitored
                      through behavioral models. Corporate credits must be rated once a year (the REPL
                      requires quarterly). Board of directors and senior management of the bank should be
                      regularly informed about rating results.

                      The CAMEL rating process/GAR module lays out specific review processes for evaluating
                      the credit risk management processes. For example, questions aim to check whether
                      banks have the necessary policies and procedures regarding the credit risk management,
                      risk appetite and CCR.

                      The BRSA undertakes special examinations that target certain banking activities/credit
                      portfolios according to the risk evaluations conducted at the beginning of a bank’s
                      supervisory cycle. The assessor team reviewed a sample of 4 such examinations in the
                      credit portfolio area. See EC 3 for detail of observations.

EC2                   The supervisor determines that a bank’s Board approves, and regularly reviews, the credit
                      risk management strategy and significant policies and processes for assuming, 48
                      identifying, measuring, evaluating, monitoring, reporting and controlling or mitigating
                      credit risk (including counterparty credit risk and associated potential future exposure) and
                      that these are consistent with the risk appetite set by the Board. The supervisor also
                      determines that senior management implements the credit risk strategy approved by the
                      Board and develops the aforementioned policies and processes.

Description and       GCM Principle 1 requires that the board of directors to determine, in writing, and approve
findings re EC2       the credit strategies in light of market conditions, the bank’s financial condition, risk
                      appetite, etc. It goes on to direct that the board of directors periodically reviews the
                      financial and economic indicators used in establishing the credit strategy and make the
                      necessary changes in the strategy and practices. Implementation of the credit risk strategy

counterparty risk associated with various financial instruments.

      by the senior management or another related unit of the bank is also addressed
      throughout the GCM.

      Principle 2 requires banks to establish marketing, credit-granting and monitoring policies
      in line with their credit volume and complexity of activities. According to paragraph 13,
      those policies are approved by the board of directors and reviewed annually (Paragraph
      15). Credit procedures are established in writing by senior management or the board of
      directors according to Paragraph 25.

      GCPRM directs that the board of directors must approve counterparty credit risk (CCR)
      management strategies. The level of risk appetite should be reviewed periodically and the
      frequency and scope of this review should be determined according to CCR level and
      complexity of the bank. A sound CCR management framework shall include the
      identification, measurement, management, approval and internal reporting of CCR. The
      Guideline details requirements for the measurement, monitoring, and reporting of CCR to
      the board and senior management. Parameters for CCR risk mitigation practices are
      enumerated as well.

      The BRSA conducts onsite review of credit risk management and the attendant strategies,
      policies and controls through its CAMELS review/GAR methodology process. During this
      process, the examiners may decide to conduct specialty examinations targeting areas such
      as corporate loans, commercial loans, SME loans etc. These activities provide the
      opportunity for the examiners to test management implementation of board established
      risk appetite and strategies and current bank practices.

      For more detailed description of the credit examination process, see EC 3 below.

EC3   The supervisor requires, and regularly determines, that such policies and processes
      establish an appropriate and properly controlled credit risk environment, including:

      a)   a well-documented and effectively implemented strategy and sound policies and
           processes for assuming credit risk, without undue reliance on external credit
           assessments;
      b)   well defined criteria and policies and processes for approving new exposures
           (including prudent underwriting standards) as well as for renewing and refinancing
           existing exposures, and identifying the appropriate approval authority for the size and
           complexity of the exposures;
      c)   effective credit administration policies and processes, including continued analysis of
           a borrower’s ability and willingness to repay under the terms of the debt (including
           review of the performance of underlying assets in the case of securitization
           exposures); monitoring of documentation, legal covenants, contractual requirements,
           collateral and other forms of credit risk mitigation; and an appropriate asset grading
           or classification system;
      d)   effective information systems for accurate and timely identification, aggregation and
           reporting of credit risk exposures to the bank’s Board and senior management on an
           ongoing basis;

                  e)   prudent and appropriate credit limits, consistent with the bank’s risk appetite, risk
                       profile and capital strength, which are understood by, and regularly communicated to,
                       relevant staff;
                  f)   exception tracking and reporting processes that ensure prompt action at the
                       appropriate level of the bank’s senior management or Board where necessary; and

                       and in respect of validation procedures) around the use of models to identify and
                       measure credit risk and set limits.

Description and   Requirements addressing the above are contained in the BL, REPL, and GCM. REPL
findings re EC3   (Regulation on Procedures and Principles for Determination of Qualifications of Loans and
                  other Receivables and Provisioning) has been revised and is awaiting publishing in the
                  official Gazette. As relevant, the provisions in the new document are included.

                  a)   policies for assuming credit risk w/o undue reliance on external assessments.

                  Article 52(1) of BL requires banks to measure credit risk; regularly analyze and monitor the
                  financial standing of the counterparty; obtain the necessary information and documents;
                  and establish the relevant procedures.

                  Principles 1-3 of the GCM require banks to establish credit strategies, credit policies and
                  credit procedures. Specifically, principle 17 presents selected guidelines for determining
                  customer limits, indebtedness, and solvency upon which to base credit granting – which
                  relies on internal bank analysis. Principle 14 requires that banks obtain adequate
                  information in order to assess the risk profile of the borrower and that (principle 13) banks
                  have established assessment and approval functions for credit management and
                  approvals.

                  b)   procedures for new, renewed, and refinanced exposures; structured approval
                       authorities.

                  Principles 11, 13 and 23 of GCM present parameters for approving new exposures, for
                  renewing and refinancing existing exposures, and identifying the appropriate approval
                  authority for the size and complexity of the exposures. Principle 13 requires banks to
                  establish assessment and approval functions for an effective credit management.
                  Requirements and standards for restructured credit are enumerated in principle 23.

                  Restructured Credit

                  The current REPL, Article 11, goes further in addressing terms for restructuring credit.
                  Credits experiencing a temporary liquidity problem may be restructured in order to
                  provide (reasonable) assurance that the debt will be repaid. The article requires
                  monitoring of restructured credits for at least six months in the Third (substandard),
                  Fourth (doubtful), Fifth (loss) groups of loans and other receivables. During this period,
                  provisions are continued to be set aside for the said receivables at the rates of special
                  provisions applied on the relevant group. Credits may be restructured twice, the second
                  time providing that 20% of the existing principal is collected each year. The draft REPL is




132
                                                                                        TURKEY



silent on the maximum number of times a loan may be restructured but prescribes rather
extensive “probation periods” for classification of special mention credits to be upgraded
to standard (one year). When a substandard loan is subject to forbearance (restructuring),
it can only be upgraded to special mention if certain conditions are met (including
performing as agreed for one year). If a restructured special mention credit goes past due
30 days, then it must be classified substandard. However, the draft REPL prescribes a
rather extensive timeframe for writing off such a substandard credit that hits the loss
classification. It states that once a restructured credit falls into the substandard category
and is past due for one year, it will be classified in the 5th group (loss) and the bank will
be required to write-off the uncollateralized portion within a maximum period of one year.

Further, the regulation allows restructuring of loans in the loss category. Credits in this
loan classification generally should not have the opportunity to be restructured as they
are, by definition, permanently impaired and considered “nonbankable” assets. In some
systems, such credits are prohibited from being restructured. (The draft REPL is silent on
this, but, in fact, should offer guidance here as silence may indicate approval of previously
allowed (imprudent) restructuring of loss credit.)

Restructured credit facilities may be transferred and posted to the “Account of Loan
Facilities Renewed and Subject to Redemption Plan” at the end of this period, providing
that at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total amount of receivables is repaid, and they are
traced and pursued in the same group for at least six months, and the repayments are not
delayed. (The draft REPL extends the monitoring period to one year before consideration
of a classification change.)

Discussions with the BRSA indicated that reports on a host of credit issues are received by
the offsite department, including information on restructured credits. Examiners indicated
that restructured credit is, in fact, reviewed when special credit examinations are
conducted – as a part of the relevant portfolio.

c)   continued analysis of a borrower’s ability and willingness to repay under the terms of
     the debt; monitoring of documentation, legal covenants, contractual requirements,
     collateral and other forms of credit risk mitigation; and an appropriate asset grading or
     classification system.

Article 52 of the BL requires banks to “measure (loan exposures); regularly analyze and
monitor the financial standing of the counterparty; obtain the necessary information and
documents; and establish the relevant procedures”. GCM principles 1-3 and principles 15,
17, 24, 25 and 26 detail the parameters regarding the monitoring of documentation, legal
covenants, contractual requirements, collateral and other forms of credit risk mitigation;
and an appropriate asset grading or classification system. The Communique on Credit Risk
Mitigation Techniques (CCRM) sets down procedures and principles relating to credit risk
mitigation techniques to be used by banks in calculation of regulatory capital requirement.
REPL presents the terms and conditions for asset classification.

Loan Classification System

         REPL enumerates loan classification requirements. The Second Part of the regulation
         directs that loans are categorized/classified based on the state of borrower
         creditworthiness and/or delinquency status. The following presents the minimum for
         credit classification. Still, much of the classification process by the banks and examiners is
         driven by the past due status of the given credit(s).

         •   Special Mention (“close monitoring”) – > 30 up to 90 days

         •   Substandard (“limited collectability”) - > 90 up to 180 days (provisioning: 20%)

         •   Doubtful - > 180 days to 1 year (50%)

         •   Loss - > over 1 year (100%)

         •   Credits classified substandard and worse are considered nonperforming.

         Review of special examinations of loan portfolios, mutually agreed by the BRSA and the
         BCP team identified a number of key issues which are further discussed in BCP 18 Problem
         Assets, Provisions, and Reserves. However, the issues identified with REPL content are
         presented in here.

         Classification categories enumerated and required by REPL are internationally used.
         However, the definitions for the classifications themselves are unclear and substantially
         overlapping. This is particularly the case for the special mention and substandard
         categories.

         Special mention includes, according to the REPL, credits that:

         •   are required to be monitored closely due to such reasons as observation of negative
             developments in solvency or cash flow of the debtor, or suspecting of such
             developments, or the borrower’s bearing a substantial and material financial risk

         •   These elements indicate that, on a financial basis, the current sound worth and paying
             capacity of the borrower is exhibiting well defined credit weaknesses – the concrete
             definition of substandard.

         •   The substandard definition reflects very similar parameters and goes on to state:

         •   (credits) which fully have a limited collectability due to inadequacy of shareholders’
             equity or guarantees of the borrower in repayment of debts on due dates thereof, and
             which may probably cause damages and losses if the observed problems are not
             corrected or remedied; or

         •   creditworthiness of the borrower weakened and which is accepted to have been
             weakened

         Review of the sample portfolio examinations clearly indicated that both the banks and the
         examiners are blurring the use of these 2 classification categories, although more so the
         banks in the examples seen. Furthermore, the examples highlighted that banks also are
         maintaining “watch lists” which can be considered precursors to special mention
         classifications (or worse). Reviews by the examiners accurately identified credits in this



134
                                                                                           TURKEY



group that rightly deserved to be in substandard or worse categories. This may be, in part
due to the nature of the special mention category (as well as the desire to avoid additional
provisioning and disclosure). (It should be noted that, in their loan portfolio special
examinations, examiners typically do not dive into the accuracy of credits already classified
as NPL, but focus on those that are carried on management’s “watch list” and special
mention credits.) The impact of this is further discussion in BCP 18. However, the
definitions and use of the classifications require clarification and strengthening. Review of
the draft REPL indicated much the same issue with the definitions.

The framework for loan loss provisions and observations therein are provided in BCP 18.

d)   MIS for accurate and timely identification, aggregation and reporting of credit risk
     exposures to the bank’s Board and senior management on an ongoing basis In addition
     to the general requirements regarding information systems of banks in RICAAP Article
     11, Principles 6-8 of the GCM include the provisions for the documentation and
     information systems for credit risk. Principle 6 requires that information and
     documents concerning credits for each customer should be easily accessible, principle
     7 requires banks to establish effective information systems with respect to the credit
     management. Moreover, in accordance with Principle 8 banks should design
     information systems in line with the size and complexity of their operations. Also in
     line with paragraph 56, results of internal system analysis will be shared regularly with
     senior management and audit committee regarding their importance.

e)   prudent and appropriate credit limits, consistent with the bank’s risk appetite, risk profile
     and capital strength, which are understood by, and regularly communicated to, relevant
     staff The RICAAP, specifically Article 5, requires that boards set an appropriate risk
     appetite and that risk limits are established commensurate with the risk appetite,
     capital, and management resource of the bank. The regulation requires effective
     communication of the risk appetite and limit structures through the bank.

f)   exception tracking and reporting processes that ensure prompt action at the appropriate
     level of the bank’s senior management or Board where necessary.

In accordance with paragraph 14 of the GCM, credit policies should address identifying
and reporting exceptions to credit policy. Paragraph 59 of GCM require risk management
units to assess and report the frequency of such credit exceptions.

g)   effective controls (including in respect of the quality, reliability and relevancy of data
     and in respect of validation procedures) around the use of models to identify and
     measure credit risk and set limits.

BCP 27, EC 3 details the BRSA’s requirements for model validation as per the GFVM. For
CCR, Paragraph 7 of GCPRM stipulates that where the bank is using an internal model for
CCR, senior management must be aware of the limitations and assumptions of the model
used.




                                                                                                  135

                  From the IT point of view, banks’ information systems must meet the standards set in
                  RITEA. For example, according to article 25 (2)(b) of RITEA banks’ processes regarding
                  retail and corporate loans are audited by external auditors and results of this audit are
                  submitted to BRSA. If any deficiencies regarding standards laid down in RITEA are
                  observed during the IT audits conducted by external auditors those deficiencies are taken
                  into account within the scope of regular on-site examinations.

                  BRSA Credit Examination Process

                  The management and risk control over the credit operations of a bank are evaluated
                  through both the CAMELS review/GAR methodology. During this process, the examiners
                  may decide to conduct specialty examinations targeting areas such as corporate loans,
                  commercial loans, SME loans etc. It is during the specialized examination process that the
                  examiners have the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the bank’s credit
                  underwriting, monitoring, early identification and classification processes as well as the
                  risk management oversight mechanisms. Further comments on the adequacy of the
                  examination process are offered in the rating comments below and in BCP 18.

EC4               The supervisor determines that banks have policies and processes to monitor the total
                  indebtedness of entities to which they extend credit and any risk factors that may result in
                  default including significant unhedged foreign exchange risk.

Description and   Banks are required to have policies and processes to monitor the total amount of
findings re EC4   customer indebtedness held by the bank. According to Article 107 of GCM, the foreign
                  exchange risk exposure of customers in other banks is also taken into consideration in
                  effective credit administration process.

                  In the CAMELS risk assessment process, GAR process directs examiners to have
                  information about total indebtedness of firms in the market. Reviews of 4 sample
                  examinations showed that aggregate customer indebtedness (on and off-balance sheet) is
                  also gathered during certain specialized examinations and classified consistent with the
                  borrower classification. However, the manner in which the examiners present and write up
                  the credits that they review during the special examination does not clearly depict the
                  nature and volume of other related exposures (in the given bank) which, if presented,
                  would help put the overall borrower relationship in context.

EC5               The supervisor requires that banks make credit decisions free of conflicts of interest and
                  on an arm’s length basis.

Description and   Article 50 of the BL requires banks that the loan conditions cannot vary from the loans
findings re EC5   made available to other persons and groups and from market conditions, in favor of the
                  borrower. It explicitly states that all loans should be extended on an arm’s length basis.

                  Please also see BCP 20, Related Parties.

EC6               The supervisor requires that the credit policy prescribes that major credit risk exposures
                  exceeding a certain amount or percentage of the bank’s capital are to be decided by the

                  bank’s Board or senior management. The same applies to credit risk exposures that are
                  especially risky or otherwise not in line with the mainstream of the bank’s activities.

Description and   According to Article 5(1) of Regulation on Credit Transactions by Banks (RCT), the powers
findings re EC6   for extension of credit in a bank basically rest with the board of directors and the board
                  may delegate its powers for extension of credit to a credit committee or headquarters.
                  According to Article 5(2) the maximum amounts the board of directors can delegate to
                  credit committee or headquarters are up to 10 percent and up to 1 percent of own funds
                  respectively.

EC7               The supervisor has full access to information in the credit and investment portfolios and to
                  the bank officers involved in assuming, managing, controlling and reporting on credit risk.

Description and   Articles 65, 66, 95 and 96 of the BL grant the right to the BRSA to have full access to
findings re EC7   information in the credit and investment portfolios and to the bank officers involved in
                  assuming, managing, controlling and reporting on credit risk. The institutions under the
                  scope of BL and their activities shall be subject to supervision of the BRSA. The BRSA may
                  send representatives to the meetings of the general assemblies of banks, for observation
                  purposes. The institutions should keep their information and documents regarding their
                  internal control, risk management and internal audit systems, accounting and financial

EC8               The supervisor requires banks to include their credit risk exposures into their stress testing
                  programs for risk management purposes.

Description and   According to Article 43(4) of RICAAP, banks are required to have stress testing program
findings re EC8   which requires, an overall firm-wide stress testing, in addition to each material risk type,
                  including credit risk.

                  According to principle 27 of GCM, banks should perform stress testing and scenario
                  analysis in monitoring and measuring risks arising from credit portfolio. Banks are required
                  to make analysis on the current and future capital requirements for credit risk. Banks are
                  required to conduct stress testing on an individual risk level and also on a firm-wide basis.
                  GCPRM principle 7 also gives guidance on counterparty credit risk stress testing program.

Assessment of     Materially Non-compliant
Principle 17

Comment           The legal framework for credit risk is generally comprehensive. It establishes the
                  responsibility of the board in this area, requires a framework for the credit business of
                  banks, as well as prescribes properly controlled credit risk environment. However, several
                  issues exist within the framework which compromise the effectiveness of this framework
                  and its application.




                                                                                                              137

         As prescribed in regulation and organized in practice (verified through review of credit
         portfolio special examinations presented by the BRSA during the assessment) the credit
         risk management oversight (line management function) and credit risk management
         function and the organization therein create loopholes in independence and integrity of
         credit risk monitoring and reporting to bank boards and the BRSA:

         1.       The framework design does not require ongoing, independent (from the business
         line) credit risk monitoring of large individual exposures or homogeneous portfolios.
         Important source data (e.g., identification of deteriorating credits, level of (accurately)
         classified assets, status of restructured credits, etc.) is generated by a line management
         function (credit monitoring) without independent verification that 1) management
         identification processes are accurate and timely, 2) that management, itself, is well
         informed of the risk it is running and is upholding board prescribed underwriting
         standards, and therefore, accurately conveying its business risk, and that 3) timely
         borrower intervention is activated.

         2.       This (unverified) information generated by the line function is source data used by
         the risk management functions for audit committee and board reporting and is also likely
         the information also reported to the BRSA for monitoring and examination purposes.

         Although the internal audit function plays an important role in ensuring a strong control
         environment, the function itself is not designed to play an ongoing surveillance role such
         as the independent credit risk management unit. It cannot replace the need to have such a
         function within the bank(s).

         Highlighting the issues surrounding this organizational environment, examiners, through
         their inspection process, have identified important, clearly inaccurate classifications of
         credit that could easily indicate the existence of 1 and 2 above. However, the significance
         of these inaccurate classifications was not clear from the examination samples reviewed.
         Consistently, there was no indication of the size of the sample of reviewed credits, how
         significant the aggregate, inaccurately classified credit was to the total portfolio, and if
         such findings could be extrapolated to the entire portfolio.

         Credit classification definitions, particularly in the special mention and substandard
         categories are overlapping. Evidence demonstrates that both the examiners, but especially
         the bankers, fluidly move credits among these categories which compromises the picture
         of the bank’s risk profile which accurate classification is intended to depict. As well, such
         movement and less rigorous classification impacts provisioning levels and ultimately, the
         accuracy of the bank’s financial statement.

         The REPL explicitly allows restructuring of loss credit which is considering in many systems
         to be outright imprudent activity as such loans are, by definition, permanently impaired
         and considered “nonbankable” assets. In some systems, such credits are prohibited from
         being restructured. The draft REPL is silent on this issue but theoretically would allow this
         practice. This practice should be explicitly addressed (disallowed).

                     The manner in which the examiners present and write up the credits that they review
                     during the special examination does not clearly depict the nature and volume of other
                     related exposures (in the given bank) which, if presented, would help put the overall
                     borrower relationship in context.

Principle 18         Problem assets, provisions and reserves. 49 The supervisor determines that banks have
                     adequate policies and processes for the early identification and management of problem
                     assets, and the maintenance of adequate provisions and reserves. 50

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to formulate policies and processes for
                     identifying and managing problem assets. In addition, laws, regulations or the supervisor
                     require regular review by banks of their problem assets (at an individual level or at a
                     portfolio level for assets with homogenous characteristics) and asset classification,
                     provisioning and write-offs.

Description and      Articles 52 and 53 of the BL stipulate the rules that banks must follow for loan evaluation.
findings re EC1      In particular, Article 52 of the BL requires banks to regularly analyze and monitor the
                     financial standing of their borrowers and borrowers are obliged to provide the necessary
                     information to the banks on both solo and consolidated basis. Article 53 requires banks to
                     establish, implement, and regularly review the policies regarding the monitoring of the
                     loans under follow-up and their loan loss provisions. In addition, the Regulation on the
                     Procedures and Principles for the Evaluation of Loans and Other Receivables (REPL) sets
                     the rules on classification of loans (into five groups) and the criteria for loan loss
                     provisioning.

                     Article 12(9) of REPL requires banks to prepare an exclusive report containing views about
                     the loans that exceed TL 250,000 and, in any case, the largest top 200 loans, on a quarterly
                     basis or in case of occurrence of any risk event.

                     The article 16(10) and (12) of the Communiqué on Financial Statements and Their
                     Disclosures to be Announced to Public by Banks (CPD) requires banks to disclose the
                     amounts of write-offs as well as their policies and procedures on write-offs respectively.

                     On the other hand, the REPL does not include parameters for write-offs. The draft REPL
                     specifies write-off criteria in relation to IFRS 9 requirements.

                     Additionally, in GCM, principle 28 states that banks should have written policies
                     concerning the management of non-performing loans and receivables. The processes of
                     credit monitoring and liquidation should be established in a way to secure collection
                     efficiency. As well, banks should establish a unit apart from credit assessment and
                     marketing units for the management of NPLs. Banks should identify the criteria

49Principle 17 covers the evaluation of assets in greater detail; Principle 18 covers the management of problem
assets.

                  concerning the determination and reporting of problematic loans which need to be
                  monitored closely, classified into a different group, and which require provisioning and/or
                  additional remedial measures.

                  The proper implementation of REPL is assessed during the on-site examinations and the
                  data on Performing Loans, Non-Performing Loans, Restructured Loans and Provisions for
                  Non-Performing Loans, Solo and Consolidated Compliance of Banks to Credit Limits are
                  monitored offsite by means of call reports sent by banks on a monthly/quarterly basis.

                  Furthermore, audit committee reports and meetings are analyzed in terms of credit
                  classification and provisioning. Management committee meetings and board decisions
                  about the policies and strategies established for the management of problem assets are
                  also evaluated during the on-site examination process.

                  Of note, the BRSA prepared a new draft REPL for which the responses of the stakeholders
                  haves been received during the public consultation phase. Draft REPL is currently awaiting
                  publication in the official gazette. The BRSA informed the BCP team that the draft takes
                  into account IFRS 9 for provisioning purposes and keeps five group classification of the
                  current regulation. Additionally;

                  * the entry and exit criteria of sub-groups are elaborated,

                  * the definition of non-performing loans is linked to the Basel II default definition and the
                  stage 3 of the IFRS 9,

                  * forbearance is defined as a cross-cutting category based on EBA ITS dated 20.02.2015.

                  * criteria for reclassification from non-performing to performing loans is determined,

                  * write-off criteria are laid down by considering IFRS 9 requirements,

                  * expected loan loss provisions are required to be recognized in compliance with the IFRS
                  9, and

                  * Banks are required to review loans on a quarterly basis or in case of occurrence of any
                  risk event for re-classification purposes. Also, the banks are required to document their
                  assessments regarding the largest 200 loans or the loans exceeding TL 500.000.

EC2               The supervisor determines the adequacy of a bank’s policies and processes for grading
                  and classifying its assets and establishing appropriate and robust provisioning levels. The
                  reviews supporting the supervisor’s opinion may be conducted by external experts, with

Description and   The on-site examiners assess the objectivity and adequacy of internal procedures and
findings re EC2   internal controls necessary for an independent inspection of bank lending activities. The
                  SMCEP directs that this assessment as well as the assessment of the adequacy of a bank’s
                  policies and processes for grading, classifying, and provisioning its assets are made taking
                  into account several factors such as:

•   The effectiveness of the internal rating system of the bank,

•   Whether the internal procedures as well as the MIS system of the bank allow for the
    board and management to obtain timely and appropriate information on the
    condition of the loan portfolios,

•   Whether the internal procedures of the bank established for monitoring the loan
    portfolios and classification of the loans are in compliance with the relevant
    legislation,

•   Whether the findings of the internal audit and internal control groups about the
    problem assets are sufficiently taken into account by the bank’s management,

•   Robustness of the collateral data used for capital adequacy calculations,

•   The adequacy of the provisioning levels of the bank in relation to regulatory
    requirements and with respect to the risk profile and quality of the credit risk
    management system of the bank,

•   The accuracy of loan classification based on a sufficiently large examination sample of
    loans.

During the full scope examinations, with reference to SMCEP, the on-site team assesses a
cross section of a significantly large sample of individual loans, including the highest risk
exposures. In particular, loans are selected on the basis of different sources and criteria
including, inter alia,

•   the loan reports produced by the bank,

•   list of loans categorized in the second group (special mention) pursuant to REPL,

•   list of loans past due,

•   the report of potential problem loans produced by the off-site team,

•   previous examination reports produced by the BRSA with respect to the loan portfolio
    of the bank,

•   list of obligors classified in the 2nd group (special mention) by other banks pursuant
    to the REPL,

•   list of restructured/rescheduled loans.

•   the selection of the sample of individual loans pays particular attention to the
    significance of the individual loan in the portfolio and to the fact that the examination
    sample adequately represents the total loan portfolio of the bank. In every instance,
    on-site team examines at least the 200 firms/obligors having the highest level of risk
    in the total loan portfolio.

Furthermore, notes to financial statements prepared according to the CPD and audited by
external auditors, include various information on issues such as grading and classification
of assets, and the loan loss provisioning levels. This information is also reviewed with

TURKEY



         respect to their consistency with the information provided by the bank and where
         appropriate, used as an input during the on-site examination process.

         As well, examiners pay particular attention to the loans classified as special mention since
         these loans have a potential to be classified as NPL in the future. In that context,
         according to the SMCEP, on-site examiners take into account several factors including the
         following:

         -        whether the debtor is classified in the special mention group by other banks,

         -        whether the debtor has been refinanced by the bank under examination or by
         any other bank in the sector,

         -        whether the debtor has any reimbursed non-cash loans in the bank under
         examination or in any other bank in the sector,

         -        whether the debtor has any NPL in the bank under examination or in any other
         bank in the sector in the past.

         Assessor Observations:

         The BCP team reviewed special examinations of credit portfolios, mutually agreed by the
         assessors and the supervisors. The reviews focused on the process of the examination
         team, findings and subsequent supervisory response/corrective actions. The examination
         findings were thorough and demonstrated application of many of the above outlined
         objectives. At the same time, the review identified the following key points which are
         embedded in the analysis and results process:

         •        Of the credits reviewed, written up, and featured in the examination reports, the
         exam team did, in fact, identify important deficiencies in the subject bank’s classification
         and the (lack of) accuracy therein.

         •        Review of the examination report highlighted several issues:

         o        Size and significance of the group credits sampled and reviewed was not
         enumerated.

         o        A number of credits were re-classified by the examiners.

                 There was no indication of the relative significance of the findings relative to the
         total portfolio, especially given some of the critical classification issues identified. No
         indication if the findings could be extrapolated to the rest of the portfolio.

                 No indication if, based on the findings, expansion of the credit sample was
         warranted to support findings about the condition of the portfolio.

                 The loan write-ups themselves were not complete enough to convey the nature
         of the credit relationship and any connected customer relationships/exposures. Total
         indebtedness did not break out the various, more significant on/off balance sheet
         extensions; context of the total credit relationship was not provided, i.e., payment history:
         number of times the credit—and associated credits—had been renewed or restructured, if

                     interest was capitalized, if the credit was on nonaccrual, what the collateral position was
                     and integrity of estimated values, etc.

                             As a result of limited information in the write up, it was difficult to assess if the
                     final classification was accurate or not.

                             Provisioning impact was not presented.

                             There was no documentation retained on the review of the “standard” loans in
                     order to substantiate the reasonableness of maintaining the standard classification.

                     •        Overall conclusions focused on internal control issues rather than higher level
                     implications on the condition and management of the credit portfolio under examination.

                     •        As a result, the examination exercise missed opportunity to identify very
                     important linkages with and conclusions on:

                     o        Management’s understanding of their business and credit risk, ability to identify
                     deterioration proactively – thereby allowing for early intervention.

                     o        Implications for internal systems => function, role, and independence of credit
                     risk management – thereby validating the systems that both the bank’s board and the
                     BRSA depends upon in order to effectively oversee the institution. As well, these systems
                     are key to the exercise of risk based supervision by the BRSA.

                     o        Inputs to evaluate corporate governance of the bank.

                     o        Accuracy of information conveyed to the board and the BRSA

                     Drawing such conclusions and linkages to management adequacy and internal systems
                     then, is critical to validating the systems risk based supervision depends upon. Also, it
                     would provide the basis for supervisory response and, as required, corrective actions by
                     the BRSA.

                     During discussions with the BCP team, the BRSA conveyed that although such linkages are
                     not explicitly presented in the reports themselves, they are, indeed, very important inputs
                     to the CAMELS risk rating process as well as to the risk matrix and profile. These
                     instruments then convey the level of supervisory priority and serve as an input for future
                     supervisory activities.

EC3                  The supervisor determines that the bank’s system for classification and provisioning takes
                     into account off-balance sheet exposures. 51

Description and      With reference to article 48 of the BL, the REPL covers the rules for classification and
findings re EC3      provisioning of all off-balance sheet items. The draft regulation also covers the rules for
                     classification and provisioning of all off-balance sheet items.


51It is recognized that there are two different types of off-balance sheet exposures: those that can be unilaterally
cancelled by the bank (based on contractual arrangements and therefore may not be subject to provisioning), and
those that cannot be unilaterally cancelled.

                  -        whether the obligor has reimbursed non-cash loans,

                  -        the ratio of reimbursed non-cash loans to total non-cash loan portfolio of the
                  bank,

                  -        past due days of the obligor with respect to cash loans,

                  -        the level of concentration risk in off-balance sheet items.

EC4               The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate policies and processes to ensure
                  that provisions and write-offs are timely and reflect realistic repayment and recovery
                  expectations, taking into account market and macroeconomic conditions.

Description and   The minimum provisioning rates are determined according to the loan categories. Articles
findings re EC4   6(3) and 6(4) of the REPL require banks to consider financial and macroeconomic factors
                  including sectoral and firm specific conditions and to base their calculations on
                  reasonable and supportable assumptions. Additionally, article 10(8) of the REPL allows
                  banks to make higher provisions than the minimum rates stipulated in the article 8 of the
                  REPL. REPL authorizes BRSB to set higher levels of general and special provisions taking
                  into account the risks in different sectors and countries.

                  The draft REPL requires banks to recognize their loan loss provisions consistent with IFRS
                  9. The BRSB is authorized to increase general and special provisioning levels both for a
                  specific bank or a specific loan type for the whole banking sector.

                  As mentioned in EC1, the REPL does not include a rule on write-offs. However, write-off
                  criteria are laid down in draft Regulation on the Procedures and Principles for Accounting
                  Practices and Retention of Documents by Banks (RAP) by considering IFRS 9 requirements
                  which was opened for public consultation. In that context, article 10(A) of the draft RAP
                  requires banks to write-off the uncollateralized portion of their non-performing loans
                  within a maximum period of one year after their classification in the 5th group.

                  In addition to the above mentioned draft regulations, the BRSA will publish a guideline in
                  alignment with the Guidance on Credit Risk and Accounting for the Expected Credit Loss
                  (GACL) published by the BCBS so that the GACL will be incorporated into the national
                  regulatory framework. As a result, within the context of IFRS 9 and the GACL, forward
                  looking information and macroeconomic factors are to be taken into account by banks in
                  provisioning.

                        In addition to the provisioning requirements above, specific provisions are made net of
                        collateral values. REPL assigns a haircut to collateral values depending on the item.
                        Requirements for valuation of collateral are specified in CCRM and GFVM. The BCP team
                        was informed that banks ensure that adequate collateral underpins the preponderance of
                        their credit exposures, sometimes to the extent of over-collateralizing. Real estate
                        composes the majority of the collateral. Banks use firms approved by the BRSA to value
                        real estate. Underlying collateral must be revalued once a credit exposure is classified as
                        NPL. In general, banks have approximately 75% loan loss coverage on current NPL levels.

                        Several observations are made on the provisioning for NPLs, special mention, and the
                        general portfolio. The historical and statistical support for standard (general) and special
                        mention loan categories is not substantiated by accumulated experience. It is not clear if
                        appraised values, within a range, are being realized upon the sale of the properties or if
                        provisioned amounts are adequately covering loss experience on classified loans. Clear
                        parameters should be established for periodic valuation of underlying collateral on NPL
                        exposures.

54Retail loans carry a higher provisioning rate due to efforts to slow credit growth in this area. General provisions for
retail loans excl mortgages and credit cards = 4%. Provisioning requirements go up to 10% for group retail loans that
have been extended.

                  The on-site examination teams assess the adequacy of the provisioning levels of the bank
                  with respect to regulatory requirements stipulated in REPL. Write-offs and loan sales are
                  also considered in the context of the examination of NPL portfolio of the bank. In that
                  context, on-site examiners analyze the internal policies, procedures and practices of the
                  bank with respect to write-offs and asset sales.

                  Off-site supervision makes analysis complementary to the on-site work and produces
                  early warning information regarding the loan portfolio. In that context, a Report on
                  Potentially Problematic Loans on a semiannual basis is produced and sent to on-site
                  examination teams. In that report, a loan is considered to be potentially problematic if it
                  meets one of the following criteria:

                  -          if the loan is classified as NPL by any bank,

                  -          if the loan is classified as NPL by any non-bank financial institution,

                  -          based on the information received from on-site supervision function, if it is
                  classified as NPL by the on-site examination team,

                  -          if the loan is transferred to an asset management company.

                  With regard to provisions of the SMCEP, on-site examiners to take into account the above
                  mentioned report in their analysis of the loan portfolio and in the selection of the loan
                  sample to be examined.

EC5               The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate policies and processes, and
                  organizational resources for the early identification of deteriorating assets, for ongoing
                  oversight of problem assets, and for collecting on past due obligations. For portfolios of
                  credit exposures with homogeneous characteristics, the exposures are classified when
                  payments are contractually in arrears for a minimum number of days (e.g., 30, 60, 90
                  days). The supervisor tests banks’ treatment of assets with a view to identifying any
                  material circumvention of the classification and provisioning standards (e.g., rescheduling,
                  refinancing or reclassification of loans).

Description and   Please refer to EC 1 and 4 for relevant regulations and credit portfolio review processes.
findings re EC5   The draft REPL states that loans that have an immaterial balance and that have
                  homogenous characteristics with regard to the type, credit grading/scores, collateral,
                  effective date, date to maturity, geographical location of the debtor and loan to value
                  ratio can be assessed on a group basis.

                  Examiners review homogenous credits based on various inputs including delinquency

EC6               The supervisor obtains information on a regular basis, and in relevant detail, or has full
                  access to information concerning the classification of assets and provisioning. The

Description and   REPL requires banks to record, classify, monitor, and asses their loans in alignment with
findings re EC6   Article 4 of the REPL. Banks are obliged to prepare an exclusive report containing views
                  about the loans that exceed TL 250,000 and, in any case, the largest top 200 loans, on a
                  quarterly basis or in case of any significant risk event.

                  The draft REPL also requires banks to maintain adequate documentation to support their
                  asset classification and provisioning levels. Banks are required to review their loans on a
                  quarterly basis or in case of occurrence of any risk event for re-classification purposes.
                  Banks are required to document their assessments regarding the largest 200 loans or the
                  loans exceeding TL 500.000.

                  Regarding the reports received by the BRSA with regard to classification of assets and
                  provisioning, banks are obliged to submit off-site call reports on asset classification, asset
                  quality and provisioning. The monthly detailed loan report (KR202AS) provides customer
                  level details of each loan, including, loan classification, loan type (cash, non-cash), sector,
                  collateral, date of default, and provision amount.

                  The BRSA also has access to the more detailed CRB data which also includes scoring
                  information of debtors. In the BRSA reporting sets, asset management companies are also
                  required to report their acquired portfolios (corporate, retail or other) on a quarterly basis.
                  Moreover, supervisors always have access to banks’ records and staff when required.

EC7               The supervisor assesses whether the classification of the assets and the provisioning is
                  adequate for prudential purposes. If asset classifications are inaccurate or provisions are
                  deemed to be inadequate for prudential purposes (e.g., if the supervisor considers
                  existing or anticipated deterioration in asset quality to be of concern or if the provisions
                  do not fully reflect losses expected to be incurred), the supervisor has the power to
                  require the bank to adjust its classifications of individual assets, increase its levels of
                  provisioning, reserves or capital and, if necessary, impose other remedial measures.

Description and   In case on-site supervisors determine that asset classifications are inaccurate or provisions
findings re EC7   are deemed to be inadequate for prudential purposes (based on the classification criteria
                  in Article 4 of REPL) then the bank is instructed to reclassify those assets and/or set aside
                  additional provisions. Additionally, insufficient provisioning or misclassification of assets
                  are breaches that lead to financial penalty according to Article 146(1)(i) and 148(1)(b)
                  respectively.

                  Furthermore, pursuant to Articles 67 and 68 of the BL, the BRSA is authorized to require
                  banks, as a part of corrective measures, to set aside higher provisions if, among other
                  things, the quality of assets have deteriorated in such a manner that its financial structure
                  will weaken.

                  As well, article 37 of BL states that, in cases where it is determined that the financial
                  statements have been mispresented, the BRSB also can take necessary measures. So, if
                  provisioning level of a bank presented on financial statements approved by external

                  auditors is determined as insufficient by the BRSA examiners, the BRSB may require banks
                  to set aside additional provisions.

                  Under the draft REPL the BRSB is authorized to increase general and special provisioning
                  levels both for a specific bank or a specific loan type for the whole banking sector.

                  On-site examiners assess the accuracy of the loan classifications and adequacy of
                  provisioning levels with respect to REPL as well as the risk profile of the bank and the
                  quality of its credit risk management system.

                  Please refer to EC2, EC3, EC4 and EC5 for further details.

EC8               The supervisor requires banks to have appropriate mechanisms in place for regularly
                  assessing the value of risk mitigants, including guarantees, credit derivatives and
                  collateral. The valuation of collateral reflects the net realizable value, taking into account
                  prevailing market conditions.

Description and   Articles 9 and 10 of REPL set forth the requirements pertaining to collateral including
findings re EC8   valuation and applicable haircuts when computing special provisions to be made by
                  banks. Accordingly, the valuation of the collaterals is based on TAS. On the other hand,
                  REPL lays down specific requirements to value real estate, lien on properties. Banks are
                  also required to assess the value of the collateral in the incidence of a risk event or within
                  reasonable intervals according to the article 10(1)(c).

                  The CCRM enumerates a number of guidelines on valuation of collateral. Additionally,
                  Guideline on Fair Value Measurement (GFVM) provides principles for calculating the fair
                  value of financial instruments which are classified as risk mitigants, credit derivatives or
                  collaterals. As well, banks must have monitoring and control procedures and processes
                  including valuation and risk of loss of effectiveness of credit risk mitigation.

                  Credit risk mitigation techniques are regulated in CCRM in order to set down procedures
                  and principles to be used by banks in calculation of risk-weighted amount under the
                  scope of Standardized Approach and risk weighted exposure amounts and expected loss
                  under the scope of Foundation IRB Approach.

                  The draft REPL requires banks to value loan collateral, for calculation of the loan loss
                  provisions, based on the net realizable value of the collateral. Since net realizable values
                  takes into account the fair value, prevailing market conditions are factored into the
                  valuation. In addition, valuations of real estate collateral is subject to principles set out in
                  the RCA. Real estate collateral must be revalued at the time loans are classified as NPL.

EC9               Laws, regulations or the supervisor establish criteria for assets to be:

                  a) identified as a problem asset (e.g., a loan is identified as a problem asset
                     when there is reason to believe that all amounts due, including principal and
                     interest, will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the
                     loan agreement); and




148
                                                                                                             TURKEY



                   b) reclassified as performing (e.g., a loan is reclassified as performing when all
                      arrears have been cleared and the loan has been brought fully current,
                      repayments have been made in a timely manner over a continuous
                      repayment period and continued collection, in accordance with the
                      contractual terms, is expected).

Description and    See EC 1-4 above. REPL defines problem assets taking into account past due days and
findings re EC9    credit worthiness of the obligor. As well, the draft REPL links the Basel II default definition
                   and the stage 3 of the IFRS 9the to definition of non-performing loans. As such, although
                   the regulation considers loans classified as special mention performing loans, banks are
                   required to recognize life-time expected loss for this group of loans since they are
                   mapped to 2nd stage of the IFRS 9. Additionally, banks are required to establish relevant
                   systems for closely monitoring 2nd group loans pursuant to Article 18(4) of the draft
                   regulation.

EC10               The supervisor determines that the bank’s Board obtains timely and appropriate
                   information on the condition of the bank’s asset portfolio, including classification of
                   assets, the level of provisions and reserves and major problem assets. The information
                   includes, at a minimum, summary results of the latest asset review process, comparative
                   trends in the overall quality of problem assets, and measurements of existing or
                   anticipated deterioration in asset quality and losses expected to be incurred.

Description and    On-site examiners evaluate whether the MIS and internal procedures of the bank allow for
findings re EC10 the sufficient level of information flow to bank’s board so as to obtain timely and
                   appropriate information with regard to the classification of loans, the provisioning levels
                   and problem assets.

                   Please refer to EC2 for further details.

EC11               The supervisor requires that valuation, classification and provisioning, at least for
                   significant exposures, are conducted on an individual item basis. For this purpose,
                   supervisors require banks to set an appropriate threshold for the purpose of identifying
                   significant exposures and to regularly review the level of the threshold.

Description and    Banks are obliged to prepare an exclusive report containing views about the loans that
findings re EC11 exceed TL 250,000 and, in any case, the largest top 200 loans, on a quarterly basis or in
                   case of occurrence of any risk event according to the article 12(9) of the REPL. In the draft
                   REPL, banks will be required to document their assessments of the largest 200 loans or
                   loans exceeding TL 500.000.

EC12               The supervisor regularly assesses any trends and concentrations in risk and risk build-up
                   across the banking sector in relation to banks’ problem assets and takes into account any
                   observed concentration in the risk mitigation strategies adopted by banks and the
                   potential effect on the efficacy of the mitigant in reducing loss. The supervisor considers
                   the adequacy of provisions and reserves at the bank and banking system level in the light
                   of this assessment.

Description and   Credit concentration risk and trends across the banking sector are monitored by loan
findings re EC12 types, geography and industry by off-site supervision department through monthly
                  banking sector overview presentations and loan reports. Non-performing loans by
                  segment, sectors, and provisioning rates as well as loans under follow up and restructured
                  loans are also monitored.

                  Overview of the banking sector, risk concentrations and trends are presented to the BRSA
                  Board and some committees such as FSC and CC where necessary actions will be
                  discussed and initiated. Macro prudential measures on consumer loans such as credit
                  restrictions (increasing minimum payment ratios of credit cards, maturity restriction for
                  consumer loans, loan to value ratio for housing and vehicle loans etc.), increasing risk
                  weights for capital adequacy, increasing general provision ratios in order to curb credit
                  growth and risk accumulation may be given as recent examples.

                  Furthermore, stress tests are used for estimating following 2 years loan growth, NPL
                  growth (PD and LGD for economic capital) under both baseline and adverse scenarios
                  (please refer to CP 9 EC5 for further details).

Assessment of     Materially Non-compliant
Principle 18

Comments          The framework for credit classification and provisioning is generally adequate. However,
                  the accuracy asset classification by banks, and therefore the integrity reporting to boards
                  and the BRSA is called into question given the nature of reclassifications assigned by
                  onsite examiners and the lack of documentation therein. Loan write ups require more
                  support and context as well as need to present nature of collateral and provision impact.
                  Examination conclusions focus more on internal control issues rather than higher level
                  implications for the condition and management of the credit portfolio under examination.

                  Given the lack of (documented) focus on the implications of important bank processes,
                  the examination exercise missed opportunity to identify very important linkages with and
                  conclusions on:

                  •   Management’s understanding of their business and credit risk, ability to identify
                      deterioration proactively – thereby allowing for early intervention.

                  •   Implications for internal systems => function, role, and independence of credit risk
                      management – thereby validating the systems that the bank’s board and the BRSA
                      depends upon in order to effectively oversee the institution. As well, these systems
                      are key to the exercise of risk based supervision by the BRSA.

                  •   Inputs to evaluate corporate governance of the bank.

                  •   Accuracy of information conveyed to the board and the BRSA

                  As well, the historical and statistical support for standard (general) and special mention
                  loan categories is not substantiated by accumulated experience. It is not clear if appraised
                  values, within a range, are being realized upon the sale of the properties or if provisioned

                     amounts are adequately covering loss experience on classified loans. Clear parameters
                     should be established for periodic valuation of underlying collateral on NPL exposures.

Principle 19         Concentration risk and large exposure limits. The supervisor determines that banks have
                     adequate policies and processes to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and
                     control or mitigate concentrations of risk on a timely basis. Supervisors set prudential
                     limits to restrict bank exposures to single counterparties or groups of connected
                     counterparties. 55

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have policies and processes that
                     provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of significant sources of concentration risk. 56
                     Exposures arising from off-balance sheet as well as on-balance sheet items and from
                     contingent liabilities are captured.

Description and      Article 48 of the BL contains a very comprehensive definition of a loan which includes
findings re EC1      both on and off balance sheet exposures. RICAAP article 35(4) requires banks to have
                     effective risk management systems for key risks, based on their level of importance,
                     including concentration risks. Further, the banks shall have a mechanism through which to
                     evaluate the integrity of the risk management process including how large loans and risk
                     concentrations are overseen.

                     GMCR is a principle based guideline which explains the best practices expected from
                     banks in the area of management of concentration risk within the framework of RICAAP.
                     Banks are to have a system of identifying exposures to single or connected counterparties
                     in the same markets, sectors, supply chains, partnerships, guarantor relationship and
                     geographic region or activity fields and capture both on-balance sheet and off-balance
                     sheet positions as well as assets and liabilities, both on consolidated and non-
                     consolidated basis. Banks are required to specify personnel and units responsible for the
                     management of concentration risk and have written policies and procedures for active
                     monitoring, control and mitigation of concentration of risk.

                     GCM directs that credit risk management processes should address concentration risk and
                     diversification therein in the banks’ credit strategies and policies. As appropriate, banks
                     should mitigate increases in credit risk concentrations using various management tool
                     such as product price differentiation.



55Connected counterparties may include natural persons as well as a group of companies related financially or by
common ownership, management or any combination thereof.
56 This includes credit concentrations through exposure to: single counterparties and groups of connected
counterparties both direct and indirect (such as through exposure to collateral or to credit protection provided by a
single counterparty), counterparties in the same industry, economic sector or geographic region and counterparties
whose financial performance is dependent on the same activity or commodity as well as off-balance sheet exposures
(including guarantees and other commitments) and also market and other risk concentrations where a bank is overly
exposed to particular asset classes, products, collateral, or currencies.

                                                                                                        (continued)

                     Concentration risk is an important focus of the CAMELS review/GAR methodology
                     process. As well, it is captured in the ICAAP process and the supervisory review.
                     Supervisory evaluation of concentration risk also feeds into the risk matrix prepared as a
                     part of the supervisory cycle.

EC2                  The supervisor determines that a bank’s information systems identify and aggregate on a
                     timely basis, and facilitate active management of, exposures creating risk concentrations
                     and large exposure 57 to single counterparties or groups of connected counterparties.

Description and      GCM Principle 8, directs that banks must have information systems which can monitor
findings re EC2      exposures by customer, group, sub-portfolios and all portfolio. GMCR Principle 3 requires
                     banks to have adequate data management systems to identify concentrations across
                     business lines and firm-wide and on an on- and off-balance sheet basis. Such
                     concentrations must be reported to senior management and to relevant business units to
                     support decision making.

                     Special examinations provide the opportunity for examiners to evaluate aggregation
                     systems for concentrations of risk. More specifically, during on-site examinations of credit
                     portfolios, examiners are required to pick up total customer relationship exposures in
                     order to evaluate credit quality on an individual exposure basis. Through this, as the
                     assessors review of a sample of special inspections revealed, the examiners are able to
                     pick up issues with the subject bank’s system. The CAMELS review/GAR methodology
                     requires supervisors to address concentration risk in counterparty, product, sector and
                     geographical region groupings.

                     From the IT point of view, banks’ information systems are required to meet the standards
                     set in RITEA. Banks’ retail and corporate loans systems (including monitoring loan limits)
                     are audited by external auditors and results of this audit are submitted to BRSA. Identified
                     deficiencies are taken into account during regular on-site examinations.

EC3                  The supervisor determines that a bank’s risk management policies and processes establish
                     thresholds for acceptable concentrations of risk, reflecting the bank’s risk appetite, risk
                     profile and capital strength, which are understood by, and regularly communicated to,
                     relevant staff. The supervisor also determines that the bank’s policies and processes
                     require all material concentrations to be regularly reviewed and reported to the bank’s
                     Board.

Description and      Concentration risk is addressed by banks through setting strategic planning and business
findings re EC3      objectives, establishing and monitoring counterparty specific, portfolio, product and other
                     limit structures and position objectives, and risk oversight mechanisms. These elements


57 The measure of credit exposure, in the context of large exposures to single counterparties and groups of
connected counterparties, should reflect the maximum possible loss from their failure (i.e., it should encompass
actual claims and potential claims as well as contingent liabilities). The risk weighting concept adopted in the Basel
capital standards should not be used in measuring credit exposure for this purpose as the relevant risk weights were
devised as a measure of credit risk on a basket basis and their use for measuring credit concentrations could
significantly underestimate potential losses (see “Measuring and controlling large credit exposures, January 1991).

                  are addressed, in part, in GMCR which requires banks to set limits in order to manage
                  concentration risks.

                  Paragraphs 47 and 48 of GMCR require banks to have a system to report concentration
                  risk timely, accurately and comprehensively to senior management, boards, and related
                  units ensuring effective decision-making in the management of concentration risk.
                  RICAAP requires the bank’s system of limits, risk appetite, etc. to be communicated
                  throughout the bank.

                  Risk concentrations are captured in the ICAAP process which is reviewed by the BRSA.

                  A framework for risk concentration control and management is provided through
                  regulation and the RICAAP process. However, review of the onsite examination
                  process for credit risk (CP 17, 18) where issues surrounding risk identification as well
                  as questions surrounding the implications of findings on the broader risk
                  management processes were cited could have a bearing on the supervisory process
                  for concentration risk identification, monitoring and control.

EC4               The supervisor regularly obtains information that enables concentrations within a bank’s
                  portfolio, including sectoral, geographical and currency exposures, to be reviewed.

Description and   The surveillance call reports received from banks include details of sector, geography and
findings re EC4   currency information and risk concentration on customer basis (KR202AS-monthly).
                  Monthly basis summary call reports on country risk and currency concentration (UL200AS,
                  UL211AS) enable off-site supervisors to evaluate the extent of on and off-balance sheet
                  concentration risk in banks. Single and group exposures (close to or in excess of 20% of
                  regulatory capital for related party and 25% for other individual or group exposure); large
                  exposures; top 25, 50 and 100 exposures are also received.

                  Supervision reports and reviews include concentrations including loan portfolio, sectoral,
                  geographical, currency accumulations. Findings are compared against peer group and
                  sector positions and used in banks’ risk assessment reports.

                  There are minimum regulatory requirements for loan concentrations which are closely
                  monitored. These, which are determined by laws and regulations, include, inter alia, banks
                  own risk group, major owners, large exposures (KS100AS and KS100UK, exposure limits
                  consolidated and non-consolidated), real estate (GS100AS, real estate limits).

                  Furthermore, Article 12(9) of REPL requires banks to prepare an exclusive report
                  containing views about the loans that exceed TL 250,000 and, in any case, the largest top
                  200 loans, on a quarterly basis or in case of occurrence of any risk event.

EC5               In respect of credit exposure to single counterparties or groups of connected
                  counterparties, laws or regulations explicitly define, or the supervisor has the power to
                  define, a “group of connected counterparties” to reflect actual risk exposure. The
                  supervisor may exercise discretion in applying this definition on a case by case basis.




                                                                                                              153

Description and      Article 49 of the BL defines the following four risk groups (a) group of counterparties
findings re EC5      unconnected with the bank, (b) related parties (those connected with the bank), (c) group
                     of connected counterparties of state owned banks and (d) group of connected
                     counterparties of state owned non-bank enterprises. The Article states that the “the BRSA
                     shall set the principles and procedures of implementation of this Article and principles
                     and procedures to be applicable to the identification of the (natural) and legal persons to
                     be included in the same risk group ....”. The BRSA has covered these elements in the RCT,
                     which prescribes the norms for identifying risk groups and aggregating various types of
                     cash and noncash exposures. Article 49 of the BL requires banks to include in the same
                     risk group, real (natural) and legal persons that have surety, guarantee or similar
                     relationships where the insolvency of one will lead to the insolvency of the other.

EC6                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor set prudent and appropriate 58 requirements to control
                     and constrain large credit exposures to a single counterparty or a group of connected
                     counterparties. “Exposures” for this purpose include all claims and transactions (including
                     those giving rise to counterparty credit risk exposure), on-balance sheet as well as off-
                     balance sheet. The supervisor determines that senior management monitors these limits
                     and that they are not exceeded on a solo or consolidated basis.

Description and      Article 54 of the BL set limits to the amount of loans to be granted to a single or group of
findings re EC6      connected counterparties. Article 48 provides a comprehensive definition of a loan, both
                     on and off balance sheet. Article 49 provides a comprehensive definition of “risk group” or
                     group of connected parties.

                     The total amount of loans to be extended by a bank to a real or a legal person or a risk
                     group shall not be more than 25 %of its own funds. For the bank’s own risk group, the
                     limit shall be set at 20%. The Board may increase this rate up to 25% or to lower it back
                     down to the legal limit. For further limitations on a bank’s own risk group, see BCP 20.

                     Loans made available to a real or legal person or a risk group that are equal to or exceed
                     10% of own funds shall be considered large loans and the total of such loans shall not
                     exceed 8 times of the own funds according to the article 54(4).

                     Pursuant to Article 43 of the BL, all ratios and limits in the BL are required to be calculated
                     by parent banks on a solo and consolidated basis. Article 54 of the BL states that these
                     limits are calculated on consolidated basis by parent banks.

                     Article 20 of the GMCR requires banks to measure, monitor, and report concentrations of
                     risk.

                     As explained in EC 3, in GAR; supervisor examines thresholds and specific limits for all
                     types of exposures including off-balance sheet risks, regarding concentrations of sector,
                     product, customer, risk group, shareholders, reviews reporting to senior management, and
                     reviews compliance with bank policies and internal and regulatory limits. The General Risk


58 Such requirements should, at least for internationally active banks, reflect the applicable Basel standards. As of

                     Limits (KS100AS-KS100UK) reports are used for monitoring the compliance with the above
                     mentioned limits and if any deficiencies are observed, the necessary actions are taken by

EC7                  The supervisor requires banks to include the impact of significant risk concentrations into
                     their stress testing programs for risk management purposes.

Description and      RICAAP 43 requires banks to establish and operate a stress testing program in order to
findings re EC7      measure their material risks and vulnerabilities in general terms. GST Principle 12 requires
                     banks to stress test their portfolios and business units to identify risk concentrations that
                     may arise across their book. GMCR Principle 3 emphasizes the importance of
                     concentration risk stress testing, including to identify and measure various hidden
                     concentrations.

                     See BCP 8, EC 5 for further expansion on stress testing.

Additional
criteria

AC1                  In respect of credit exposure to single counterparties or groups of connected
                     counterparties, banks are required to adhere to the following:

                     a)   ten per cent or more of a bank’s capital is defined as a large exposure; and
                     b)   twenty-five per cent of a bank’s capital is the limit for an individual large exposure to
                          a private sector non-bank counterparty or a group of connected counterparties.

                     Minor deviations from these limits may be acceptable, especially if explicitly temporary or
                     related to very small or specialized banks.

Comments             The legal framework addressing concentration risk and large exposures limits is generally
                     in line with international standards. The definition of connected parties is comprehensive.
                     The BRSA examines and monitors various exposures including, inter alia, large exposures,
                     concentrations by sector, product, customer, and risk group.

                     to write off exposures to related parties in accordance with standard policies and
                     processes.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws or regulations provide, or the supervisor has the power to prescribe, a
                     comprehensive definition of “related parties”. This considers the parties identified in the
                     footnote to the Principle. The supervisor may exercise discretion in applying this definition
                     on a case by case basis.

Description and      The definition of related parties is sufficiently comprehensive to capture relevant real and
findings re EC1      legal persons within the scope of the bank.

                     According to BL article 49 a bank and its qualified shareholders, members of its board of
                     directors and its general manager as well as the undertakings they control individually or
                     jointly, directly or indirectly or participate with unlimited responsibility or where they are
                     members of board of directors or general manager constitute a risk group including the
                     bank. Jointly-controlled undertakings shall be included in the risk group of each
                     shareholder that controls together these undertakings. Risk groups include real and legal
                     persons who have such relationships (surety, guarantee or similar relationships) where the
                     insolvency of one will lead to the insolvency of the other. By the authority given in this
                     article, BRSA may extend the risk group definition to include legal or real persons that
                     may have material effects on the solvency of the risk group.

                     Article 50 of the BL prohibits banks from granting cash or non-cash (OBS) loans,
                     purchasing bonds or similar securities to:

                     a)   members of the board of directors, general manager, deputy general managers and
                          employees that are authorized to extend loans; their spouses and children under their
                          custody; and the undertakings where they individually or jointly own twenty-five
                          percent or more of the capital,
                     b) employees other than those mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) and their
                        spouses and children under their guardianship,
                     c)   funds, associations, unions or foundations established by or for their employees.

                     Article 50 further directs that the prohibitions above will not apply to the loans made
                     available to the board members and employees and family members thereof of the bank
                     that do not exceed 5 times their monthly total net remuneration and credit in the form of




60 Related party transactions include on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit exposures and claims, as well as,
dealings such as service contracts, asset purchases and sales, construction contracts, lease agreements, derivative
transactions, borrowings, and write-offs. The term transaction should be interpreted broadly to incorporate not only
transactions that are entered into with related parties but also situations in which an unrelated party (with whom a
bank has an existing exposure) subsequently becomes a related party.

                     check book and credit cards may not be granted over 3 times monthly total net
                     remuneration. The total of these loans is very small in size.

                     For banks who are majority owned, separately or jointly by the Treasury Undersecretariat,
                     Privatization Administration or the administrations subject to the general budget or an-
                     nexed budget (i.e., State owned), are considered a risk group, together with their affiliated
                     companies. The non-bank state economic enterprises or other public institutions and
                     enterprises that are majority owned by the Privatization Administration shall constitute a
                     risk group together with companies in which they own or influence management and
                     supervision.

EC2                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require that transactions with related parties are not
                     undertaken on more favorable terms (e.g., in credit assessment, tenor, interest rates, fees,
                     amortization schedules, requirement for collateral) than corresponding transactions with
                     non-related counterparties. 61

Description and      BL article 50 of the BL directs that loans to natural and legal persons in the bank’s risk
findings re EC2      group requires approval of two thirds majority of the board of directors’ members and
                     that the loan conditions shall not differ from the loans made available to other persons
                     and groups and from market conditions, in favor of the borrower. Additionally, in order to
                     ensure that credit to related parties are not undertaken on more favorable terms and to
                     prevent conflict of interests the principle 3, paragraph 28 of the GCM states that, the
                     approval processes and work flows for credits which are extended to the bank risk group
                     should be separately determined.

                     While Article 48 of the BL provides a comprehensive definition of “loan”, it does not
                     include other non-credit transactions within the limitations addressing related parties.
                     Legislation should be expanded to explicitly capture all transactions, including loans,
                     within the parameters of related party limits and requirements.

EC3                  The supervisor requires that transactions with related parties and the write-off of related-
                     party exposures exceeding specified amounts or otherwise posing special risks are subject
                     to prior approval by the bank’s Board. The supervisor requires that Board members with
                     conflicts of interest are excluded from the approval process of granting and managing
                     related party transactions.

Description and      Article 50 of the BL stipulates that the decisions for loan extensions to natural and legal
findings re EC3      persons in the bank’s risk group are required to be made by two thirds majority of the
                     board of directors’ members and that the loan conditions should not differ from the loans
                     made available to other persons and groups and from market conditions, in favor of the
                     borrower.

                     There is no explicit provision that requires prior approval of related party transactions by
                     the bank’s board. No explicit provision requires approval (prior or post) of write-off of

                  related party transactions. The assessor team was informed that no such write offs have
                  occurred in the recent past.

                  According to Article 51 of the BL, bank personnel authorized to extend loans cannot take
                  part in the evaluation and decision-making phases for the loan transactions involving
                  themselves, their spouses, children or their related risk group. Additionally, in order to
                  ensure that transactions with related parties are not undertaken on more favorable terms
                  and to prevent conflicts of interest the principle 3, paragraph 28 of GCM requires banks to
                  separate, independent approval processes and work flows for credits extended to the
                  bank’s risk group.

EC4               The supervisor determines that banks have policies and processes to prevent persons
                  benefiting from the transaction and/or persons related to such a person from being part
                  of the process of granting and managing the transaction.

findings re EC4
                  Article 7(2) (s) of RICAAP requires the bank’s audit committee to monitor whether
                  personnel receiving bank credit participates in the decision making process. This includes
                  any related credit extended to the person’s risk group. Appropriate communication
                  channels must exist for reporting these issues to the audit committee.

                  According to GCM paragraph 78, the board of directors establishes the structure and
                  practices which will prevent the shareholders, bank management or other relevant parties
                  from intervening credit assessment process.

                  Additionally, in line with the principle 26, paragraph 156 of GCM, banks should assign
                  qualified staff for monitoring the credits. These monitoring activities cover the conditions
                  related to collaterals and guarantees for credits. In assigning this staff, banks are required
                  to establish a monitoring structure which will not cause any potential conflicts of interest.

                  RCT, which regulates the procedures and principles for the credits extended by the banks,
                  has also provisions for identification of natural persons and legal entities to be included in
                  the bank’s risk group.

                  Related party exposures are examined as part of the loan review process during CAMELS
                  on-site supervision.

EC5               Laws or regulations set, or the supervisor has the power to set on a general or case by
                  case basis, limits for exposures to related parties, to deduct such exposures from capital
                  when assessing capital adequacy, or to require collateralization of such exposures. When
                  limits are set on aggregate exposures to related parties, those are at least as strict as
                  those for single counterparties or groups of connected counterparties.

Description and   Article 50 establishes limitations on lending to a bank’s related parties. See EC 1 for the
findings re EC5   specific language. Thereafter, that allowable exposure is monitored and addressed within
                  the context of legislation addressing credit exposures overall.

                  According to BL article 54(1), the total amount of loans to be extended by a bank to a
                  natural or legal person or a risk group shall not exceed 25% of the bank’s own funds. This
                  rate shall be applied as 20 % for the bank’s risk group. The BRSB may increase this rate up
                  to 25% or to lower it down to the legal limit. The loans made available to an
                  unincorporated undertaking shall be considered as made available to partners in
                  proportionate to their responsibilities. (In practice, no such increase in a bank’s limit
                  threshold to 25% has been granted by the BRSA.)

                  In any event paragraph 54 limits the total of loans extended by banks to all shareholders
                  who have more than 1% share in the capital of banks, irrespective of whether they are
                  controlling owners or whether they own qualified shares, and to persons who constitute a
                  risk group with such persons, to no more than 50% of own funds.

                  In cases violations of the relevant law, articles 50 and 51 authorize the BRSA to deduct the
                  excesses from a bank’s own funds or to require the bank to obtain additional own funds
                  equal to the amount of such loans.

                  RCT article 13 of RCT directs that calculation of credit exposures for purposes of
                  application of the limits to risk groups shall be on a consolidated basis – including the
                  financial institution’s affiliates subject to consolidation.

EC6               The supervisor determines that banks have policies and processes to identify individual
                  exposures to and transactions with related parties as well as the total amount of
                  exposures, and to monitor and report on them through an independent credit review or
                  audit process. The supervisor determines that exceptions to policies, processes and limits
                  are reported to the appropriate level of the bank’s senior management and, if necessary,
                  to the Board, for timely action. The supervisor also determines that senior management
                  monitors related party transactions on an ongoing basis, and that the Board also provides
                  oversight of these transactions.

Description and   Legislation largely addresses lending to related parties (the bank’s risk group) within the
findings re EC6   context of lending parameters in general. The BL specifically assigns responsibility to the
                  board for implementing strong internal systems within the bank which includes effective
                  risk management and internal audit processes. It is within this scope of activity that the
                  monitoring of related party transactions occurs. Within this context, according to Article
                  51 of the BL, bank personnel authorized to extend loans cannot take part in the evaluation
                  and decision-making phases for the loan transactions involving themselves, their spouses,
                  children or their related risk group. (As stated in EC 5 above, lending to board members is
                  currently prohibited except on very restricted terms.)

                  Additionally, in order to ensure that transactions with related parties are not undertaken
                  on more favorable terms and to prevent conflicts of interest the principle 3, paragraph 28
                  of GCM requires banks to separate, independent approval processes and work flows for
                  credits extended to the bank’s risk group.

                  Article 7(2) (s) of RICAAP requires the bank’s audit committee to monitor whether
                  personnel receiving bank credit participates in the decision making process. This includes



                                                                                                                159

                  any related credit extended to the person’s risk group. Appropriate communication
                  channels must exist for reporting these issues to the audit committee.

                  See also BCP 17/18 for credit risk monitoring and management. See also EC 3 above for
                  the board approval processes for undertaking credit exposures to a bank’s risk group.
                  During the CAMELS review/GAR methodology, related party exposures are examined as
                  part of the loan review process. As well, examiners evaluate thresholds and specific limits
                  for all types of exposures including related party exposures. Moreover, FSAID 2914 aims
                  to review the level of ratio of loans extended to related parties to the regulatory capital.
                  And this assessment affects the asset quality component of the CAMELS rating system.

                  It should be noted, however, that review of the onsite examination process for credit risk
                  (CP 17, 18) where issues surrounding risk identification as well as questions surrounding
                  the implications of findings on the broader risk management processes were cited could
                  have a bearing on the supervisory process for related party transactions.

EC7               The supervisor obtains and reviews information on aggregate exposures to related parties.

Description and   Exposures to related parties are closely monitored by off-site supervisors by means of
findings re EC7   monthly call reports. Banks shall regularly report and update the names of all real and
                  legal persons in their own risk group (KR105AS), their shareholders (HS200AS) and their
                  affiliates and subsidiaries (IS200AS) on a monthly basis. Loans extended to related party
                  (KR202AS), transactions with related party in financial sector (MS200AS), derivative
                  transactions with related party (BD101GS), related party risk limits (exposure to bank’s
                  own risk group shall not exceed 20% of regulatory capital-KS100AS) are the main
                  surveillance call reports which are used for reviewing aggregate exposures to related
                  parties. In addition to that banks disclose the information about transactions with their
                  own risk group in the external audit reports quarterly as it is required by article 22 of CPD.

                  As well, banks prepare an intragroup transactions report annually for consolidated
                  supervision. Supervision teams assess that report in their examination processes. The
                  report covers transactions with financial/nonfinancial parties that the bank controls
                  directly or indirectly, transactions of affiliate financial/nonfinancial parties amongst
                  themselves of which bank is not a part, transactions of the bank and its
                  financial/nonfinancial affiliates with the controlling shareholder, transactions of the bank
                  and its financial/nonfinancial parties with the controlling shareholder’s other partnerships.

Comments          The legal and regulatory framework for related parties is generally comprehensive. The
                  offsite department receives and regularly monitors reporting from banks. Examiners
                  evaluate related party exposures during the onsite review. Offsite monitoring is
                  comprehensive.

                     There is no explicit provision that requires prior approval of related party transactions by
                     the bank’s board. As well, no explicit provision requires approval (prior or post) of write-
                     off of related party transactions.

                     As well, while Article 48 of the BL provides a comprehensive definition of “loan” and
                     related party limitations address such, legislation does not include other non-credit
                     transactions within the limitations addressing related parties. Legislation should be
                     expanded to explicitly capture all transactions, including loans, within the parameters of
                     related party limits and requirements.

                     The assessment team was informed that a draft revision of the BL is being prepared by the
                     BRSA. Within this context, article 50 (a and b) may be revoked to allow board member
                     borrowing from the bank. It will also address related party “transactions” as well. The
                     assessment team cautions the BRSA on relaxing related party risk parameters. There are
                     countries that continue to rigorously restrict extension of credit, as well as transactions
                     with, related parties of the bank, including board members. This is an area which
                     historically has proven consistently problematic in distressed bank situations. Therefore,
                     the team advises caution in widening the scope for such exposures.

Principle 21         Country and transfer risks. The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies

                     country risk 62 and transfer risk 63 in their international lending and investment activities on
                     a timely basis.

Essential criteria

EC1                  The supervisor determines that a bank’s policies and processes give due regard to the
                     identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting and control or mitigation
                     of country risk and transfer risk. The supervisor also determines that the processes are
                     consistent with the risk profile, systemic importance and risk appetite of the bank, take
                     into account market and macroeconomic conditions and provide a comprehensive bank-
                     wide view of country and transfer risk exposure. Exposures (including, where relevant,
                     intra-group exposures) are identified, monitored and managed on a regional and an
                     individual country basis (in addition to the end-borrower/end-counterparty basis). Banks
                     are required to monitor and evaluate developments in country risk and in transfer risk and
                     apply appropriate countermeasures.

Description and      GCRM is a principle based guideline which explains the best practices expected from
findings re EC1      banks regarding the management of country risk within the framework of RICAAP Article


62 Country risk is the risk of exposure to loss caused by events in a foreign country. The concept is broader than

sovereign risk as all forms of lending or investment activity whether to/with individuals, corporate, banks or
governments are covered.
63Transfer risk is the risk that a borrower will not be able to convert local currency into foreign exchange and so will
be unable to make debt service payments in foreign currency. The risk normally arises from exchange restrictions
imposed by the government in the borrower’s country. (Reference document: IMF paper on External Debt Statistics –
Guide for compilers and users, 2003.)

         35 which determines purpose of risk management and implementation of risk
         management systems including country and transfer risks. Country and transfer risks are
         defined in this guideline as well as contagion risk, indirect foreign-exchange risk, indirect
         country risk, macroeconomic risk and sovereign risk. According to the guideline, banks
         should establish country risk management processes in accordance with their risk profile,
         systemic importance and risk appetite after identifying market and macroeconomic
         conditions and scope and depth of their country risk exposure.

         GCRM Paragraph 3 draws a framework for adequate country risk management structure
         both on consolidated and non-consolidated basis considering the size and complexity of
         bank's activities including senior management surveillance, strategy, policy and
         procedures, risk analysis, measurement, monitoring and controlling.

         GCRM Paragraph 6-13 requires sovereign risk, transfer risk, contagion risk, and the
         categories of indirect exchange risk, macroeconomic risk and indirect country risk to be
         taken into account in management of country risk. A risk management process should be
         established in accordance with risk profile, systemic importance and risk appetite after
         identifying market and macroeconomic conditions, scope and depth of risk exposure.
         Country risk exposures must be identified, measured, monitored and managed on the
         basis of each country and country groups (considering the borrower on ultimate position
         and other counterparties), subsidiaries and participations. Emerging developments in
         relevant countries must be monitored.

         GCRM Principle 1 states that banks should clearly identify the country risk strategy, policy
         and procedures and document them. Senior management is responsible for
         implementing, however the board of directors has the ultimate responsibility in
         establishing country risk strategy, policy and procedures.

         BRSA examines the risks regarding Pillar II in terms of definition, measurement,
         assessment, surveillance, reporting, modelling, back testing and supervision of risks in on-
         site examination of banks. Country and transfer risk is one of the significant part of that
         examination. Management of country and transfer risk policies and procedures of banks
         are being examined within the scope of ICAAP.

         One of the most significant objectives of supervision is assessment of risks and
         determination of risk profiles of the banks. SMRAC is the framework which is used to
         prepare the risk matrix all relevant risks. As one of the essential part of the supervision
         cycle, country and transfer risk is described in SMRAC to be considered in examination of
         the banks.

         SMGAR requires examiners to consider country risk in assessment of banks. Supervisor
         assesses whether the bank has made an analysis evaluating the necessity of using a model
         for measurement of country and transfer risk within the scope of ICAAP (FSAID 2459) and
         examines validation/backtesting results in modelling policies for measuring required
         capital (FSAID 2466) and at the same time oversees the recognition of those results in
         decision making processes (FSAID 2471).

                  Through the CAMELS review/GAR methodology process, the examiners review the bank’s
                  oversight and management process; oversight of country risks arising from bank’s
                  partnerships, shareholders and shareholder’s partnerships; the volume of activity of its
                  clients abroad, etc.

EC2               The supervisor determines that bank’ strategies, policies and processes for the
                  management of country and transfer risks have been approved by the banks’ Boards and
                  that the Boards oversee management in a way that ensures that these policies and
                  processes are implemented effectively and fully integrated into the banks’ overall risk
                  management process.

Description and   GCRM Principle 1 requires banks to identify the country risk strategy, policy and
findings re EC2   procedures, and to have them approved by the board of directors in order to ensure to be
                  considered in all decision processes. Moreover, senior management is responsible for
                  implementing these strategy, policy and procedures. Paragraph 17 also declares that
                  board of directors shall regularly review the bank's country risk exposure. Paragraph 38
                  requires country risk limits to be approved by the Board. As well, paragraph 38 requires
                  that relevant limits should be approved by the board and linked to capital.

                  Through the CAMELS review/GAR methodology the examiners verify that the proper
                  board approvals for policies and strategies have been given as well as the reports
                  provided the board. The BRSA requires banks to have an effective organizational structure
                  regarding management, limitation and supervision of country and transfer risks and
                  allocation of authorized staff.

EC3               The supervisor determines that banks have information systems, risk management
                  systems and internal control systems that accurately aggregate, monitor and report
                  country exposures on a timely basis; and ensure adherence to established country
                  exposure limits.

Description and   GCRM Principle 6 requires banks to have an information system, a risk management
findings re EC3   system and an internal control system that monitor and report country risks. Moreover,
                  banks should regularly review IT systems to enable country limits to be monitored on a
                  timely basis, to ensure appropriate measures to be taken where necessary, and to ensure
                  adherence to established country exposure limits. The GCRM requires setting limits on an
                  individual country basis and a system for establishing, controlling, monitoring and
                  reporting country limits and risks.

                  Through the CAMELS review/GAR process, the examiner evaluates the country risk
                  management process and verifies that internal audit addresses the key aspects of country
                  risk management and internal controls.

                  It should be noted, however, that review of the onsite examination process for credit risk
                  (CP 17, 18) where issues surrounding risk identification as well as questions surrounding
                  the implications of findings on the broader risk management processes were cited could
                  have a bearing on the supervisory process for country and transfer risk.

EC4               There is supervisory oversight of the setting of appropriate provisions against country risk
                  and transfer risk. There are different international practices that are all acceptable as long
                  as they lead to risk-based results. These include:

                  a)   The supervisor (or some other official authority) decides on appropriate minimum
                       provisioning by regularly setting fixed percentages for exposures to each country
                       taking into account prevailing conditions. The supervisor reviews minimum
                       provisioning levels where appropriate.
                  b)   The supervisor (or some other official authority) regularly sets percentage ranges for
                       each country, taking into account prevailing conditions and the banks may decide,
                       within these ranges, which provisioning to apply for the individual exposures. The
                       supervisor reviews percentage ranges for provisioning purposes where appropriate.
                  c)   The bank itself (or some other body such as the national bankers association) sets
                       percentages or guidelines or even decides for each individual loan on the appropriate
                       provisioning. The adequacy of the provisioning will then be judged by the external
                       auditor and/or by the supervisor.

Description and   BRSA implements the method (c). The Articles 7(9) and 8(4) of the REPL give authority to
findings re EC4   the BRSA to increase general and specific provisions for banks by considering country risk.

                  The draft REPL Article 10(2) and 11(2) requires banks to make additional provisions for
                  country and transfer risks above the minimum amount determined for general and
                  specific provisions.

                  GCRM Paragraph 13 directs a bank to reserve capital or make provisions for country risk
                  exposures by considering its portfolio structure, size and emerging developments. Banks
                  may apply various risk-based methods accepted in this context.

                  GCRM Paragraph 14 requires the written policies and procedures of a bank on country
                  risk management shall include system, policy, methodology and processes applied in
                  making provision or reserving capital.

                  During the ICAAP review, the examiners review the management process surrounding
                  country risk management and the adequacy of provisioning for exposures therein.

EC5               The supervisor requires banks to include appropriate scenarios into their stress testing
                  programs to reflect country and transfer risk analysis for risk management purposes.

Description and   RICAAP 43 requires banks to establish and operate a stress testing program in order to
findings re EC5   measure its material risks and vulnerabilities. GCRM Principle 5 requires banks to perform
                  stress tests for country risk analysis including using sufficiently severe scenarios to
                  adequately analyze the nature of exposures.

                  The examiners evaluate stress testing programs in the context of the ICAAP review and
                  during examination of country and transfer risks when and as appropriate for the level
                  and nature of the bank’s exposures.

EC6                  The supervisor regularly obtains and reviews sufficient information on a timely basis on
                     the country risk and transfer risk of banks. The supervisor also has the power to obtain
                     additional information, as needed (e.g., in crisis situations).

Description and      The article 96(1) of the BL provides authority to the BRSA to request any related
findings re EC6      information from banks and related parties indicated in this article. By using this power,
                     the BRSA can demand all needed document and information from banks.

                     Country risks are closely monitored through monthly basis two call reports: “UL200AS,
                     Country And Foreign Currency Risks- Balance Sheet Accounts” and “UL211AS, Country
                     And Foreign Currency Risk—Off-Balance Sheet Accounts”. Moreover, call reports such as
                     Loans-detailed (KR202AS), “Transactions with Financial Sector (MS200AS) and “Cross
                     Border Organizations Reporting Set” are used for country risk analysis. “Country Risk
                     Report” and “Cross Border Organizations of the Banks Established in Turkey report” are
                     the final off-site supervision products about country risks.

                     Additionally, reports or notes are prepared when needed in special cases or crisis (e.g.,
                     recent special notes on Greece Risks, Russian Risks). In these cases ad-hoc information
                     other than regular call reports can always be gathered in a very short time from banks.

Assessment of        Compliant
Principle 21

Comments             BRSA guidance adequately captures country and transfer risk as well as other relevant
                     risks. Banks are expected to establish country risk parameters as well as systems for
                     monitoring exposures, including indirect foreign-exchange risk and indirect country risk.
                     Country risk is evaluated through the CAMELS review process and via the risk matrix of
                     the bank.

Principle 22         Market risk. The supervisor determines that banks have an adequate market risk
                     management process that takes into account their risk appetite, risk profile, and market
                     and macroeconomic conditions and the risk of a significant deterioration in market
                     liquidity. This includes prudent policies and processes to identify, measure, evaluate,
                     monitor, report and control or mitigate market risks on a timely basis.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have appropriate market risk
                     management processes that provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of market risk
                     exposure. The supervisor determines that these processes are consistent with the risk
                     appetite, risk profile, systemic importance and capital strength of the bank; take into
                     account market and macroeconomic conditions and the risk of a significant deterioration
                     in market liquidity; and clearly articulate the roles and responsibilities for identification,
                     measuring, monitoring and control of market risk.

Description and      The Article 29 of the BL requires banks to implement adequate and efficient internal
findings re EC1      control, risk management and internal audit systems that are commensurate with the
                     scope and structure of their activities, that can respond to changing conditions and that

         cover all their branches and undertakings subject to consolidation in order to monitor and
         control risks that they encounter. Foreign exchange risk is the primary market risk of
         banks in the Turkish system.

         The overall framework of risk management is defined in RICAAP. Article 5 and 38 directly
         assigns responsibility to the board to establish the risk appetite and ensure fluid
         communication lines through the bank. The board is responsible for determining the
         organizational structure, policies, procedures, authorities of the units, etc. It further
         requires in article 38 that risk limits are established in relation to allocated capital and risk
         appetite. Responsibilities for identification, measuring, monitoring and control of each risk
         has been given to risk management unit of banks according to article 37. Management
         responsibilities and duties are articulated in article 41.

         Banks shall manage their market risk according to the provisions of this Regulation beside
         the principles and procedures stated in the Guideline on Market Risk Management
         (GMRM) within the frame of principle of proportionality. GMRM is a principle based
         guideline explaining the best practices and processes expected from banks regarding the
         management of market risk. It advises a proportionality approach in which banks adopt
         processes in relation to the size and complexity of their activities. GMRM Principle 2
         requires banks to establish a sound and comprehensive risk management framework,
         systems through which to concerning measure, monitor, and control market risk and to
         execute their business in accordance with them. Minimum factors to be included in the
         framework and processes regarding the measurement, monitoring, and controlling of the
         market risk are stated in this principle in detail.

         GMRM Paragraph 8 states that banks should also take into account the general market
         and macroeconomic conditions in which they operate in their assessment and
         management of risks and their loss absorbing capacity. Moreover, Paragraph 23 clarifies
         that all significant risks should be measured and aggregated on a bank-wide basis. As
         well, policies should be applied on a consolidated and non-consolidated basis and should
         clearly determine the lines of responsibilities of the Board, senior management, units
         within the internal systems and other personnel responsible for managing market risk as
         well as identifying processes of reviewing or updating policies in cases of considerable
         changes occurred in the bank’s market risk profile.

         During the CAMELS rating process/GAR methodology, examiners use GMRM as a manual
         for market risk supervision. Therefore, each principle and paragraph in GMRM determines
         the on-site supervision framework for market risk.

         Examiners also assess the level of risks and risk profiles of the banks according to SMRAC
         which guides the preparation of the risk matrix. SMRAC has a special chapter for
         determining the risk level and the management quality of market risk. According to
         SMRAC, examiners determine risk profile and assess the adequacy of policies and
         procedures, the level of risk appetite, and the quality of risk measuring, monitoring and
         control functions including the roles and responsibilities.

                  The BRSA evaluates the level and management of market risk through the onsite GAR
                  methodology. The process includes evaluating the bank’s related strategies and policies,
                  risk appetite and risk tolerance. Examiners are further directed to check policies,
                  strategies, limit structures, and valuation processes. The result of these steps feeds into
                  the risk matrix and profile documents prepared at the end of the supervisory cycle. Banks’
                  foreign exchange exposures and business are regularly evaluated along with activity in the
                  securities and other relevant areas. Two “test” specific examinations were conducted to
                  pilot new questions and the implied processes within the context of the GAR
                  methodology and for the draft GRMR. Conclusions were drawn and presented to the
                  respective banks. As a matter of course, consolidated risk governance is reviewed during
                  the ICAAP process.

EC2               The supervisor determines that bank’ strategies, policies and processes for the
                  management of market risk have been approved by the banks’ Boards and that the
                  Boards oversee management in a way that ensures that these policies and processes are
                  implemented effectively and fully integrated into the banks’ overall risk management
                  process.

findings re EC2
                  RICAAP provides the parameters for the risk management process under which market
                  risk falls. GMRM principle 1 requires banks to establish written strategies, policies, and
                  procedures with the Board’s approval. The Board charges senior management with
                  monitoring and controlling the risk in accordance with the strategies, policies, and
                  procedures and fully integrating market risk processes into the bank’s overall risk
                  management function (paragraph 17).

                  The adequacy of policies and board approvals are addressed through the CAMELS rating
                  process/GAR methodology which is conducted onsite as well, on a higher level, through
                  the ICAAP review process. Examiners are directed to check board approval of risk appetite
                  and risk tolerance, board approval of strategies, board approval for policies, procedures
                  and workflows, roles and responsibilities in policies, procedures and workflows, board
                  approval of the definition of trading book, board oversight of the risk levels, consolidated
                  level of market risk, periodic reports to board and senior management about risk
                  management, and board oversight of implementation of policies, procedures and
                  strategies.

EC3               The supervisor determines that the bank’s policies and processes establish an appropriate
                  and properly controlled market risk environment including:

                  a)   effective information systems for accurate and timely identification, aggregation,
                       monitoring and reporting of market risk exposure to the bank’s Board and senior
                       management;
                  b)   appropriate market risk limits consistent with the bank’s risk appetite, risk profile and
                       capital strength, and with the management’s ability to manage market risk and which
                       are understood by, and regularly communicated to, relevant staff;

                  c)   exception tracking and reporting processes that ensure prompt action at the
                       appropriate level of the bank’s senior management or Board, where necessary;
                  d)   effective controls around the use of models to identify and measure market risk, and
                       set limits; and
                  e)   sound policies and processes for allocation of exposures to the trading book.
Description and   RICAAP addresses the elements of a strong risk management function that must be in
findings re EC3   place along with the calculation and support of a well-defined internal capital allocation
                  process. The Regulation requires banks to establish information systems, control of
                  transactions and control of communication channels and information systems which are
                  to be performed within the internal control function. It is the duty of internal audit system
                  to audit risk measurement models used in the bank.

                  As indicated in EC 1 above, GMRM paragraph 21 articulates the factors for effective
                  market risk framework and processes, inter alia:

                  a)   a framework to identify risks;
                  b)   an appropriately detailed structure of market risk limits that are consistent with the
                       institution’s risk appetite, risk profile and capital strength, and which are understood
                       by, and regularly communicated to, relevant staff;
                  c)   guidelines and other parameters established by the bank and used to govern market
                       risk-taking;
                  d)   rules and criteria for allocation of positions to the trading book;
                  e)   appropriate management information system (MIS) for accurate and timely
                       identification, aggregation, monitoring, controlling, and reporting of market risk,
                       including transactions between the bank and its affiliates, to the institution’s Board
                       and senior management;
                  f)   exception tracking and reporting processes that ensure prompt action at the Board or
                       senior management level, where necessary;
                  g)   effective controls around the use of models to identify and measure market risk;
                  h)   valuation policies, including policies and processes for considering and making
                       appropriate valuation adjustments for uncertainties in determining the fair value of
                       assets and liabilities (concentrated or less liquid positions); and
                  i)   action plans for possible concentrated risks (pricing differences, keeping more capital,
                       more frequent reporting, etc.).

                  The Regulation on Calculation and Implementation of Net General Position of Foreign
                  Exchange Over Own Funds Ratio for Banks on Non-Consolidated and Consolidated Basis
                  (RNFER) sets standards/rules for forex risk. It requires banks to calculate their on- and off-
                  balance sheet forex positions on a daily basis. The net aggregate position method is used
                  to calculate the overall forex position. The net general forex position should not exceed
                  ±20 percent of own funds. The BRSA is empowered to determine different ratios for
                  different banks and banking groups, but has not exercised this power to date. The BRSA
                  has not prescribed regulatory limits for other elements of market risk. These are generally
                  left to bank managements’ discretion.

                  GMRM Paragraph 21 identifies the check points in for use during the CAMELS rating/GAR
                  GAR methodology process. Besides the GMRM, the GAR methodology directs supervisors,
                  according to the level and nature of a bank’s market risk activities, to specifically address
                  accurate and timely identification and monitoring of risk through management
                  information systems, other checks in addition to regulatory limits and definitions, internal
                  models on market risk, back testing and validation for internal models on market risk,
                  measurement methods under ICAAP, controls around measure of market risk, tracking
                  systems for internal control and audit, the oversight of the of audit committee in this area,
                  internal controls and audit on market risk, valuation of derivative positions, valuation of
                  financial assets, valuation policies, business continuity plans, and concentration of risks
                  within trading book.

                  Supervisors address this guidance, as relevant, in the CAMELS/GAR process, however as
                  stated in EC 1 above, market risk otherwise would be captured in conjunction with the
                  ICAAP review process and overall risk management reviews. (See also BCP # 15 above)
                  Currently, individual, special market risk examinations have not been conducted, as a
                  matter of routine. Two targeted market risk examinations were conducted in order to
                  determine how this risk is measured and managed as well as the level of compliance with
                  the GMRM regulation. Results of these exams were presented to the banks.

EC4               The supervisor determines that there are systems and controls to ensure that banks’
                  marked-to-market positions are revalued frequently. The supervisor also determines that
                  all transactions are captured on a timely basis and that the valuation process uses
                  consistent and prudent practices, and reliable market data verified by a function
                  independent of the relevant risk-taking business units (or, in the absence of market prices,
                  internal or industry-accepted models). To the extent that the bank relies on modeling for
                  the purposes of valuation, the bank is required to ensure that the model is validated by a
                  function independent of the relevant risk-taking businesses units. The supervisor requires
                  banks to establish and maintain policies and processes for considering valuation
                  adjustments for positions that otherwise cannot be prudently valued, including
                  concentrated, less liquid, and stale positions.

Description and   Please refer to BCP Principle 27, EC 3 for a full discussion on valuation and model
findings re EC4   validation.

                  RCA Annex 3 regulates principles and procedures for prudent valuation and management
                  of the trading book for market risk regulatory capital requirement calculations.

                  GMRM Paragraph 26 states that banks should ensure that transactions are captured on a
                  timely basis and that marked-to-market positions are revalued frequently. Valuation of
                  market risk positions should be robust and independent of the risk-taking function. The
                  valuation process should use reliable market data verified independently of the business
                  line. In the absence of market prices, internal or industry-accepted models should be
                  used. Models and supporting statistical analyses used in valuations should be appropriate,
                  consistently applied, and have reasonable assumptions. These should be independently
                  validated before deployment. Staff involved in the validation process should be


                                                                                                                169

         adequately qualified and independent of those who assume market risks and develop
         models. Models should be periodically reviewed. More frequent reviews may be necessary
         if there are changes in models or in the assumptions resulting from developments in
         market conditions. It should be ensured that these changes are cautiously taken into
         consideration by the model.

         Additionally, there is a separate Guideline On Fair Value Measurement (GFVM), which
         explains the best practices expected from banks regarding the banks’ processes to
         measure the fair value of financial instruments and banks’ risk management and control
         processes related to fair valuation. In paragraph 23 of GFVM it is also emphasized that a
         valuation model must be validated before the implementation as well as after the
         implementation by an independent, suitably qualified group prior to usage, with periodic
         reviews to ensure the model remains suitable for its intended use. Details regarding a
         validation processes is also given in paragraphs 24-28.

         GMRM Paragraph 21(h) points out that risk management framework should possess
         valuation policies, including policies and processes for considering and making
         appropriate valuation adjustments for uncertainties in determining the fair value of assets
         and liabilities (concentrated or less liquid positions). GMRM Paragraph 35 states that each
         of foreign exchange rates should be considered as a different risk factor in measurement
         of foreign exchange risk within market risk. The measurement should also consider the
         risks arising from changes in values or asset-liability mismatch.

         Valuation adjustments and independent price verification processes are defined in GFVM
         paragraph 5(b) and (a). Paragraph 7 requires banks to establish and maintain governance
         structures and controls sufficient to provide prudent and reliable valuation estimates.
         Principle 6 of GFVM states that banks should have a rigorous and consistent process to
         determine valuation adjustments for risk management, regulatory and financial reporting
         purposes, where appropriate.

         According to Principle 2 of GFVM, a bank should have adequate capacity, including during
         periods of stress, to establish and verify valuations for instruments in which it engages.
         Senior management should ensure that the bank has the resources and capabilities to
         estimate appropriately the inherent risks and the value of financial instruments, including
         complex and illiquid instruments. It is also stated that, for exposures that represent
         material risk, a bank should have the capacity to produce valuations using alternative
         methods in the event that primary inputs and approaches become unreliable, unavailable
         or not relevant due to market discontinuities or illiquidity or in stressed market conditions.

         GMRM Paragraph 26 and Paragraph 21 point (h) identify the check points for supervisory
         review. Besides the GMRM, the CAMEL risk rating/GAR methodology have targeted
         questions for valuation including questions on fair value computations, on senior
         management oversight about valuation practices, on internal or external audits about
         valuation practices and management conducts about the findings, and on quality of risk
         management policies, systems and controls about valuation. Market risk is reflected in the
         CAMELS rating “S” and determined through GAR, risk matrix, and risk profile processes. As

                  well, the offsite supervision department receives and monitors regulatory reporting
                  information on a regular basis, including stress testing results on market risk (FX)
                  positions.

                  The assessor team reviewed several examples of special examinations which had as a part
                  of the process market risk elements. Conclusions, in fact, cited certain issues dealing
                  transactional deficiencies in the market risk area such as lack of independence in the
                  model validation process, etc. As well, the team reviewed selected GAR (onsite) activities
                  in this area which reflected selected market risk exam steps and related documentation.

EC5               The supervisor determines that banks hold appropriate levels of capital against
                  unexpected losses and make appropriate valuation adjustments for uncertainties in
                  determining the fair value of assets and liabilities.

Description and   RICAAP Article 60(4) states that in case the Agency, within the scope of supervision and
findings re EC5   surveillance activities, detects the probability that the bank cannot meet the internal
                  capital requirement ratio for the bank's risk profile or detects the probability that the bank
                  does not hold sufficient capital for each important risk type, it takes the measures deemed
                  necessary, including directing the bank to increase capital. A Communique on the
                  “Calculation of Market Risk Measurement Models and Assessment of Risk Measurement
                  Models” (CMR-RMM) requires BRSA approval for any market risk models used in the
                  specific calculation of related capital. The BRSA approval is not required if banks chose to
                  use models for internal risk management or capital management purposes. However,
                  requests for market risk capital calculation models have not been made to date.

                  GMRM Paragraph 10 states that the level of market risk and stop/loss thresholds should
                  be set relative to the amount of market risk capital set aside against unexpected losses. As
                  well, banks are required to establish the processes of determination of appropriate capital
                  levels against unexpected losses.

                  GMRM Paragraph 21(h) and 21(i) require banks to implement valuation policies, including
                  policies and processes for considering and making appropriate valuation adjustments for
                  uncertainties in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities (concentrated or less
                  liquid positions) and action plans for possible concentrated risks (pricing differences,
                  keeping more capital, more frequent reporting etc.). Paragraph 26 directs that in the
                  absence of market prices, internal or industry-accepted models should be used. Models
                  and supporting statistical analyses used in valuations should be appropriate, consistently
                  applied, and have reasonable assumptions. These should be validated before deployment.
                  Staff involved in the validation process should be adequately qualified and independent
                  of those who assume market risks and develop models. Models should be periodically
                  reviewed.

                  The abovementioned regulations represent check points for the CAMELS review/on-site
                  supervision. Besides the GMRM, the CAMEL risk rating process/GAR methodology has
                  specific questions for valuation and additional capital needs.

                  In practice, several large banks are using models internally for managing market risks.

                  A responsibility of the independent risk management function (one of the 3 elements of
                  internal systems) is to assure model validation. Model validation must be performed by a
                  department separate from the unit using the model. In some cases, a bank my hire an
                  external party to conduct the validation process. The BRSA reviews the model validations
                  as a part of its GAR process but does not deploy specialist expertise to review the integrity
                  of the validations. No bank has yet formally applied for using market risk models for
                  capital adequacy purposes which would require BRSA approval.

EC6               The supervisor requires banks to include market risk exposure into their stress testing
                  programs for risk management purposes.

Description and   RICAAP article 43 regulates general requirements that banks must follow for their stress
findings re EC6   testing programs. Article 43(1) requires banks to establish and operate a stress testing
                  program in order to measure their material risks and vulnerabilities which may arise from
                  both negative developments peculiar to the bank and the developments in stressed
                  economic and financial environment. Article 43(4) requires overall firm-wide stress testing
                  in addition to each material risk type. Article 43(5) states that stress tests on market and
                  counterparty risk as well as bank's total liquidity risk shall be made simultaneously once a
                  month or more frequently and results are monitored closely by the top management.

                  The Guideline On Stress Testing To Be Used By Banks In Capital And Liquidity Planning
                  (GST) also provides parameters for banks’ stress testing activities and has special
                  provisions for stress testing on market risk. Paragraphs 91 to 97 deal with stress testing on
                  market risk. Banks can consider a range of exceptional, but realistic, market shocks or
                  scenarios for their trading book positions. The Guideline also addresses back testing and
                  scenario analysis. Tests should be conducted on a bank-wide basis.

                  The CAMELS rating process/GAR methodology includes evaluation of market risk stress
                  testing and scenario analysis as well as board and senior management oversight
                  principles. Currently, the BRSA reviews market risk stress testing in the context of the
                  overall stress testing conducted for/presented in the ICAAP process. As a part of the GAR
                  review process, the market risk stress tests may be reviewed, however, specialist expertise
                  is not deployed to evaluate the scenarios or calculation details of the process.

Assessment of     Compliant

Comments          The BRSA has adopted comprehensive regulation and guidance through which to direct
                  banks to identify, measure, and monitor their market risk exposures. This includes
                  parameters for valuation, stress testing, and model use. For examination purposes, these

                      elements are largely addressed through the CAMELS rating/GAR methodology review
                      process, and on an overall basis, during the ICAAP review.

                      Of note, currently, specialist expertise is not deployed to evaluate the scenarios or
                      calculation details of the stress testing exercises. Examiners review the models used to
                      measure market risk. However, they also depend substantially on the banks’ model
                      validation process. To deepen the work and enhance the forward looking aspect, the BRSA
                      could consider deploying trained specialists to assess stress test approaches and
                      mathematical integrity and to leverage resulting advice/input on specialized exams. As
                      well, enhanced examiner expertise in the area of model evaluation could provide added
                      assurance to the BRSA on the integrity of bank models used.

Principle 23          Interest rate risk in the banking book. The supervisor determines that banks have
                      adequate systems to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate
                      interest rate risk 64 in the banking book on a timely basis. These systems take into account
                      the bank’s risk appetite, risk profile and market and macroeconomic conditions.

Essential criteria

EC1                   Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have an appropriate interest rate risk
                      strategy and interest rate risk management framework that provides a comprehensive
                      bank-wide view of interest rate risk. This includes policies and processes to identify,
                      measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate material sources of interest
                      rate risk. The supervisor determines that the bank’s strategy, policies and processes are
                      consistent with the risk appetite, risk profile and systemic importance of the bank, take
                      into account market and macroeconomic conditions, and are regularly reviewed and
                      appropriately adjusted, where necessary, with the bank’s changing risk profile and market
                      developments.

Description and       RICAAP article 35(4) directs that banks are obliged to establish and implement an effective
findings re EC1       risk management system for material risks including interest rate risk in the banking book.
                      Regulation on Measurement and Assessment of the Interest Rate Risk Stemming from the
                      Banking Book with Standardized Shock Method (RIRRBB) requires banks to have an
                      appropriate interest rate risk strategy and interest rate risk management framework that
                      provides a comprehensive bank-wide view of interest rate risk. The Guideline For Interest
                      Rate Risk Management (GIRRM) enumerates the best practices and processes expected
                      from banks regarding the management of interest rate risk.

                      GIRRM directs that interest rate risk (IRR) management systems should include: i) senior
                      management surveillance, ii) in-bank policy and procedures concerning risk management
                      which are approved by the board, iii) the process of adequate risk measurement,
                      monitoring and controlling, and iv) controlling activities. The principles are to be applied




64 Wherever “interest rate risk” is used in this Principle the term refers to interest rate risk in the banking book.
Interest rate risk in the trading book is covered under Principle 22.



                                                                                                                        173

                  on a consolidated and unconsolidated basis and consistent with the size and complexity
                  of bank’s activities.

                  GIRRM Principle 4 requires that interest rate risk measurement systems assess the effects
                  of interest rate changes on earnings and economic value. According to paragraph 30,
                  banks measurement systems should address all material sources of IRR including re-
                  pricing, yield curve, basis and option risk components.

                  GIRRM is also used as a guide during the (GAR) on-site supervision framework.
                  Furthermore, the GAR methodology includes addressing interest rate risk strategies, risk
                  appetite, and risk tolerance.

                  Examiners also assess the level of risks and risk profiles of the banks according to SMRAC
                  which guides preparation of the risk matrix (level and management of risk). SMRAC has a
                  special chapter for determining the risk level and the management quality of interest rate
                  risk in the banking book. According to SMRAC, examiners determine risk profile and
                  assess the adequacy of policies and procedures, the level of risk appetite, and the quality
                  of risk measuring, monitoring and control functions including the roles and
                  responsibilities. The questions in SMRAC are, in general, a subset of the GAR annex. This
                  process is an output of the CAMELS/GAR methodology. IRR is also monitored regularly by
                  the offsite monitoring process.

EC2               The supervisor determines that a bank’s strategy, policies and processes for the
                  management of interest rate risk have been approved, and are regularly reviewed, by the
                  bank’s Board. The supervisor also determines that senior management ensures that the
                  strategy, policies and processes are developed and implemented effectively.

Description and   RICAAP draws general framework for all internal systems and GIRRM gives specific
findings re EC2   requirements for IRRBB. RICAAP article 5(2) defines the responsibilities of the Board which
                  includes determination and approval of policies, procedures, strategy for each risk type
                  and also identification of risk appetite. Article 8(2) also gives the responsibility and duty to
                  senior management to implement the strategies and policies approved by the Board.

                  In addition, GIRRM Principle 1 requires banks to have a written strategy, policy and
                  procedures concerning the interest rate risk management approved by the board of
                  directors. The board approves and regularly assesses (through the internal systems and
                  audit committee functions) the relevant IRR activities, strategies and policies. The board
                  oversees that senior management takes the necessary steps to monitor and control the
                  risks consistent with the approved strategies and policies. The board is to periodically
                  review the adequacy of action plans and the results, measurement system and
                  assumptions concerning stress tests.

                  Principle 2 requires senior management to ensure that the level of bank's interest rate risk
                  is effectively managed. They should establish necessary processes to ensure to control
                  and to keep the risk within limits and enable required resources are available for
                  performing these processes. They are responsible for maintaining risk limits, establishing
                  effective internal controls for risk, etc. Paragraph 15 states that senior management

                                                                                                            TURKEY



                  periodically review the policies and procedures concerning the management of interest
                  rate risk and report the necessary changes to the board of directors with their reasons.
                  GIRRM Paragraph 22 sets that the policies and procedures of interest rate risk should be
                  reviewed periodically.

                  Besides the GIRRM, as part of the CAMEL review/GAR methodology requires the
                  supervisor to address: board approval for limits on interest rate risk; board and senior
                  management oversight for interest rate risk; board approval of risk appetite, risk tolerance,
                  strategies, and policies. It further requires the examiner to check roles and responsibilities
                  in policies, procedures and workflows and implementation therein.

                  In practice, the supervisor covers elements of interest rate risk through the GAR process,
                  as described in EC 1 above, which is conducted onsite but not to the depth of what a
                  special examination would require. However, specialized examinations of this area are not
                  yet conducted. There were two targeted reviews in two banks which focused on how IRR
                  is measured and managed and tested compliance with GIRRBB. Also, off-site analysis is
                  conducted on all banks to identify the treatment of IRRBB within the scope of
                  ICAAP.

EC3               The supervisor determines that banks’ policies and processes establish an appropriate and
                  properly controlled interest rate risk environment including:

                  a)   comprehensive and appropriate interest rate risk measurement systems;
                  b)   regular review, and independent (internal or external) validation, of any models used
                       by the functions tasked with managing interest rate risk (including review of key
                       model assumptions);
                  c)   appropriate limits, approved by the banks’ Boards and senior management, that
                       reflect the banks’ risk appetite, risk profile and capital strength, and are understood
                       by, and regularly communicated to, relevant staff;
                  d)   effective exception tracking and reporting processes which ensure prompt action at
                       the appropriate level of the banks’ senior management or Boards where necessary;
                       and
                  e)   effective information systems for accurate and timely identification, aggregation,
                       monitoring and reporting of interest rate risk exposure to the banks’ Boards and
                       senior management.
Description and   a)   GIRRM Principle 4 states that banks should establish interest rate risk measurement
findings re EC3        systems that include all significant sources of interest rate risk, that assess the effects
                       of interest rate changes on earnings and economic value, and that are consistent with
                       the scope and complexity of their activities. The minimum aspects of the system are
                       presented paragraph 28. GIRRM paragraph 38 requires risk managers and senior
                       management to review the assumptions in interest rate risk management system at
                       least annually. Paragraph 41 directs that all the assumptions used in interest rate risk
                       measurement system are comprehensively justified, are approved by risk
                       management unit and senior management, and are reviewed at least annually.

TURKEY



         b)   Paragraph 68 of the GIRRM directs that the frequency and extent to which a bank
              should re-evaluate its risk measurement methodologies and models depend, in part,
              on the particular interest rate risk exposures created by holdings and activities, the
              pace and nature of market interest rate changes, and the pace and complexity of
              innovation with respect to measuring and managing interest rate risk. Further, banks
              should have measurement, monitoring and control functions that are reviewed
              regularly. The staff carried out the independent review should ensure that risk
              measurement system include all the important components of interest rate risk
              management arising from on and off balance sheet positions. Reviewing process
              should include, inter alia, the accuracy and relevancy of modelling assumptions. See
              also BCP Principle 27, EC 3.

         RICAAP, the overall guiding risk management document, Article 58(1) states that an
         independent team shall validate the risk measurement methodology used in economic
         or/and regulatory capital management process within the ICAAP process. Independence
         means that the team should be independent from the units that developed the models or
         the executive units. Moreover, RICAAP Article 58(2) points out that banks can use external
         expertise in case there is insufficient scope for internal validation.

         c)   c) Principle 6 gives directions regarding the interest rate risk limits. Banks should
              determine interest rate risk limits appropriate to the internal risk management
              policies and implement these limits. Limits should be consistent with the overall
              approach to measuring interest rate risk. These limits should be established in
              conformity with the bank’s size nature and capital adequacy. The responsible senior
              manager should immediately be informed about the limit exceptions. Risk tolerance
              should be identified. Paragraph 19 requires banks to identify the specific actions
              necessary for exceptions to limits.

         GIRRM Principle 9 requires banks to establish adequate and effective internal control
         systems for the interest rate risk management process. Internal control systems should
         include an independent review and assessment that will be carried out by internal audit
         unit to measure the effectiveness of system regularly and to ensure the improvement of
         internal control if necessary.

         d)   d) GIRRM paragraph 32 points out that banks should establish reliable management
              information systems to measure, monitor, control and report interest rate risk. The
              results of risk monitoring and measuring concerning interest rate risk should be
              reported to the board of directors, senior management and relevant business line
              managers in time. Paragraphs 61 and 62 articulates the content of the necessary
              reporting.

         The CAMELS review/GAR methodology addresses elements of re-pricing risk, yield curve
         risk, basis risk and optionality risk; interest rate risk ratios; behavioral analysis of
         optionality; effect of interest rate risk on income; interest rate risk in the banking book
         under ICAAP; model validation for interest rate risk under ICAAP; internal control and
         audit for interest rate risk; the effect of interest rate risk on capital; reporting to board and

                  interest rate risk; independent evaluation of internal models and approaches; effectiveness
                  of management information systems for interest rate risk; and consolidated monitoring
                  techniques for interest rate risk.

                  From the IT point of view, banks’ information systems must meet the standards set in
                  RITEA. For example, according to article 25 (2)(c) of RITEA banks’ processes regarding
                  accounting processes regarding interest rate income and expenditure are audited by
                  external auditors and results of this audit are submitted to BRSA. If any deficiencies
                  regarding standards laid down in RITEA are observed during the IT audits conducted by
                  external auditors those deficiencies are taken into account within the scope of the
                  CAMELS review/examinations.

EC4               The supervisor requires banks to include appropriate scenarios into their stress testing
                  programs to measure their vulnerability to loss under adverse interest rate movements.

Description and   See also BCP 8, EC 5 for comments on stress testing integrity.
findings re EC4
                  RICAAP article 43 directs that banks shall establish and operate a stress testing program in
                  order to measure its material risks and vulnerabilities which may arise from both negative
                  developments peculiar to the bank and the developments in stressed economic and
                  financial environment. More specific guidance to stress testing of interest rate risk is given
                  in GIRRM and GST.

                  GIRRM Principle 7 states that banks should measure the effects of losses that may arise
                  under certain stress conditions including that the assumptions considered in interest rate
                  risk measurement may not reflect the truth.

                  GIRRM Paragraph 35 indicates that banks should use multiple scenarios including the
                  possible interactions (for example yield curve risk and basis risk) across different interest
                  rates as well as for changes in the overall level of interest rates. GIRRM paragraph 36
                  directs that projected/possible shifts in customer behavior—and potential responses to
                  those shifts by the bank—should also be stressed/modeled. Also, GIRRM paragraph 37
                  states that banks consider the expectations concerning the possible path of interest rate
                  in the future. Banks should use their own as well as the BRSA’s designated scenarios to
                  determine shocks per material each currency on the bank’s books.

                  The CAMELS review/GAR methodology directs review of scenario analysis, simulations and
                  stress testing for interest rate risk.

                     as a part of the overall ICAAP review process and captured as an input in the stress testing
                     conducted therein. As well, the supervisor covers elements of interest rate risk through the
                     GAR process, as described in EC 1 above, which is conducted onsite but not to the depth
                     of what a special examination would require. However, specialized examinations of this
                     area are not yet conducted.

                     The BRSA should develop specialized examination procedures for interest rate risk where
                     it identifies increasing or high risk areas. The BRSA should use specialized expertise with
                     which to evaluate scenarios and assumptions used for more complex stress testing as well
                     as to review model validations during onsite examinations or, as an offsite exercise.

Principle 24         Liquidity risk. The supervisor sets prudent and appropriate liquidity requirements (which
                     can include either quantitative or qualitative requirements or both) for banks that reflect
                     the liquidity needs of the bank. The supervisor determines that banks have a strategy that
                     enables prudent management of liquidity risk and compliance with liquidity requirements.
                     The strategy takes into account the bank’s risk profile as well as market and
                     macroeconomic conditions and includes prudent policies and processes, consistent with
                     the bank’s risk appetite, to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or
                     mitigate liquidity risk over an appropriate set of time horizons. At least for internationally
                     active banks, liquidity requirements are not lower than the applicable Basel standards.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to consistently observe prescribed
                     liquidity requirements including thresholds by reference to which a bank is subject to
                     supervisory action. At least for internationally active banks, the prescribed requirements
                     are not lower than, and the supervisor uses a range of liquidity monitoring tools no less
                     extensive than, those prescribed in the applicable Basel standards.

Description and      The BRSA has set up a comprehensive framework for liquidity regulation, monitoring, and
findings re EC1      bank responsibilities. The framework is grounded in the provisions of the BL and are
                     further expanded in regulation and guidance. The requirements contained therein as well
                     as the requirements under development are consistent with, and in some cases, more

                      strict than international standards. A wide range of monitoring tools are in place at the
                      BRSA for monitoring banks’ liquidity positions and funding experience.

                      According to the Article 46 (Adequacy of Liquidity) of the BL, banks are required to
                      calculate, achieve, perpetuate and report the minimum liquidity level in accordance with
                      the principles and procedures to be set by the BRSB which are put forward in the
                      Regulation on Measurement and Evaluation of Liquidity Adequacy of Banks (RLA) in 2006.
                      The objective of this Regulation is to regulate banks’ procedures and principles for
                      achievement and maintenance of adequate levels of liquidity in order to meet their
                      liabilities with their assets.

                      In March 2014, in compliance with the Basel III LCR document 65, BRSA issued a Regulation
                      on Liquidity Coverage Ratio (RLCR). The aim of RLCR is to determine the procedures and
                      principles regarding banks’ having high quality liquid assets stock at a sufficient level to
                      cover their net cash outflows in order to designate a minimum liquidity level, both at a
                      consolidated and solo basis in terms of FX and total. After in-depth analysis, in line with
                      the Basel framework, BRSB approved that deposit banks would calculate and achieve at
                      least 60% LCR and 40% FX LCR throughout 2015 and these ratios would increase 10 basis
                      points each year until 2019 and be 100% and 80% respectively unless otherwise indicated.
                      Right now, for 2016, deposit banks are required to achieve at least 70% LCR and 50% FX
                      LCR. Until January 1, 2017, consolidated LCR and FX LCR may be calculated as of the last
                      day of the month. Beginning from 2017, consolidated LCR and FX LCR may be computed
                      for each day and monthly arithmetic average is calculated. This approach is also in
                      compliance with the Basel III LCR document as well as Basel III LCR disclosure document.

                      On the other hand, BRSB decided that until an appropriate LCR is determined for
                      investment and development banks, they would calculate and report their LCRs to the
                      BRSA but they do not have to meet the required LCR. On the other hand, those banks
                      would continue to be subject to the provisions of RLA until otherwise approved by the
                      BRSB.

                      Basel III LCR document set the minimum factors, cash outflow and inflow rates. This
                      means that jurisdictions are entitled to set the factors and rates which would not be less
                      than the international requirements. The Annex 1 and Annex 2 of RLCR, where factors,
                      cash outflow and cash inflow rates for each high quality liquid asset and other items are
                      explicitly stated, were designed after in depth analysis of the banking sector. Areas where
                      Turkish LCR rules are stricter than the Basel standards are as follows:

                      •    The Basel standard allows supervisors to determine inflow percentages for other
                           contractual cash inflows, as appropriate for each type of inflow. The BRSA has set 0%
                           inflow rate for other contractual cash inflows.

         •   Even though Basel standards require LCR standard and monitoring tools to be
             applied to internationally active banks, BRSA requires RLCR provisions to be applied
             by all banks except for investment and development banks until an appropriate level
             for LCR is determined. There is ongoing work to determine an appropriate LCR for
             investment and development banks.

         •   The BRSA requires banks to calculate, report and disclose FX liquidity coverage ratio
             on both solo and consolidated basis as a regulatory standard ratio. Moreover, total
             LCR is also calculated, reported and disclosed on solo basis.

         BRSB will decide when the first implementation date will be (2017 or 2019) as well as
         whether gradual approach would be preferred for those banks after reviewing the LCRs
         and banks’ risk profiles.

         In addition to the minimum standard for the LCR, the Basel III LCR document also outlines
         the metrics to be used to monitor liquidity risks (“the monitoring tools”). The monitoring
         tools supplement the LCR standard and are a cornerstone for supervisors in assessing the
         liquidity risk of a bank. A list of the monitoring tools prescribed in the BCBS Basel III LCR
         document and the most important corresponding monitoring tools, their preparation and
         submission frequencies prescribed by the BRSA is given below:

                  There are two more monitoring tools. First one is market-related monitoring tools (where
                  supervisors can monitor market-wide information, information on the financial sector,
                  bank-specific information). For the market-related monitoring tools, as proposed by the
                  Basel standard both BRSA and CBRT use several market wide information as early warning
                  indicators in monitoring potential liquidity difficulties at banks. Market-wide information
                  and information on the financial sector are monitored by both BRSA and CBRT.

                  Of note, in 2015 the BRSA underwent a Regulatory Consistency Assessment of its Basel III
                  LCR regulations for which it received a “compliant” rating.

                  As for the bank-specific information, BRSA prepares regular off-site surveillance reports
                  on banks liquidity position and shares these with on-site supervisors. On the other hand,
                  BRSA conducts liquidity stress tests depending on market conditions when needed. In
                  addition to that, banks are required to monitor market related information on equity
                  prices, CDS spreads, money-market trading prices, the situation of roll-overs and prices
                  for various lengths of funding according to Guideline on Liquidity Risk Management
                  (GLRM).

                  The second one is Basel guidance on monitoring tools for intraday liquidity management.
                  The BCBS issued a guidance on monitoring tools for intraday liquidity management in
                  April 2013. In compliance with the requirements of this guidance, the BRSA has initiated a
                  study and consulted the industry in 2015 on its proposal to implement in Turkey.
                  Throughout 2015, meetings have taken place between the BRSA, CBRT and the banks to
                  discuss the implementation of this new reporting requirement. BRSA’s goal is to
                  implement the intraday liquidity management in Turkey before the end of 2016, prior to
                  the time limit set by the BCBS of January 2017.

                  In addition to BL, RLCR and RLA, a best practice guideline on liquidity risk management is
                  issued which is based on Article 35 of RICAAP. GLRM is a principle based comprehensive
                  guideline explaining the best practices and processes expected from banks regarding the
                  management of liquidity risk. It is prepared based on the paper “Principles for Sound
                  Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision” of BCBS and countries’ best practices.

                  Liquidity is reflected in the “L” in CAMELS. However, there is no concretely defined
                  threshold that triggers supervisory action. However, supervisory concern is elevated if
                  negative trends are detected through off-site monitoring or the GAR process. This may
                  trigger further review of liquidity levels and management in a specialized examination. See
                  EC 4 for further detail on the supervisory process.

EC2               The prescribed liquidity requirements reflect the liquidity risk profile of banks (including
                  on- and off-balance sheet risks) in the context of the markets and macroeconomic
                  conditions in which they operate.

Description and   According to RICAAP Article 35(4) banks are obliged to establish and implement an

                  The GLRM, paragraph 22, 23 directs that a bank’s board should approve liquidity risk
                  management strategies, policies and procedures established by senior management and
                  review the approved strategy at an acceptable frequency within the economic, financial
                  and operational standards and general strategy of bank (GLRM, Paragraph 23).

                  Further, GLRM Paragraph 16 states that banks should determine their vulnerabilities by
                  using the quantitative measures about concentration of funding in various maturity,
                  contingent liquidity obligations arising from off-balance sheet activities, maturity and
                  currency mismatches, and liquid asset holdings.

                  GLRM Principle 3 states that the liquidity risk appetite approved by the board of directors
                  should reflect the banks’ willingness under both normal and stressed economic
                  conditions. In addition, GLRM Principle 1 points out that the liquidity risk framework of a
                  bank should include a liquidity cushion that ensures it maintains sufficient liquidity in all
                  economic conditions.

                  The above requirements are part and parcel to the CAMELS review/GAR process. The
                  criteria contained therein plus the elements included in the GLRM are part and parcel to
                  the review.

                  For further expansion of the supervisory process, see EC 1 above and EC 4 below.

EC3               The supervisor determines that banks have a robust liquidity management framework that
                  requires the banks to maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand a range of stress events,
                  and includes appropriate policies and processes for managing liquidity risk that have been
                  approved by the banks’ Boards. The supervisor also determines that these policies and
                  processes provide a comprehensive bank-wide view of liquidity risk and are consistent
                  with the banks’ risk profile and systemic importance.

Description and   GLRM Principle 1 requires banks to establish a robust liquidity risk management
findings re EC3   framework including the strategy, policy and procedures that ensure they maintain their
                  businesses soundly.

                  GLRM paragraph 6 states that banks should establish liquidity risk management
                  framework considering that it can maintain its business positively under periods of
                  liquidity stress the source of which may be bank-specific or market-wide and it can meet
                  the daily liquidity needs.

                  According to GLRM Paragraph 13, while establishing a risk appetite, the board of directors
                  should consider different factors including business objectives, strategic direction,
                  financial structure, share in financial system, funding capacity and overall risk appetite. In
                  addition, (GLRM, Paragraphs 17 and 18) the board is also responsible for establishing a
                  liquidity risk management structure appropriate for the bank's activities, scale, complexity,
                  and size and for reviewing the appropriateness of the liquidity risk management structure
                  in the light of developments and changes in scope of bank’s business. Another

                  audit should regularly review the implementation and effectiveness of liquidity risk
                  management.

                  The CAMELS review/GAR process directs the supervisor to evaluate, inter alia, board
                  approval for policies, procedures and workflows; management roles and responsibilities in
                  policies, procedures and workflows; board oversight of implementation; and board
                  approval of strategies. In addition, the supervisor will review the ICAAP process as it
                  pertains to liquidity and also the LCR level and trends.

                  As stated, stress testing is required by the GLRM. Overall institutional stress testing is
                  conducted as a part of the ICAAP process. More specifically, banks are required to stress
                  their liquidity positions and the BRSA will review how those stress tests are used in the
                  management process.

EC4               The supervisor determines that banks’ liquidity strategy, policies and processes establish
                  an appropriate and properly controlled liquidity risk environment including:

                  a)   clear articulation of an overall liquidity risk appetite that is appropriate for the banks’
                       business and their role in the financial system and that is approved by the banks’
                       Boards;
                  b)   sound day-to-day, and where appropriate intraday, liquidity risk management
                       practices;
                  c)   effective information systems to enable active identification, aggregation, monitoring
                       and control of liquidity risk exposures and funding needs (including active
                       management of collateral positions) bank-wide;
                  d)   adequate oversight by the banks’ Boards in ensuring that management effectively
                       implements policies and processes for the management of liquidity risk in a manner
                       consistent with the banks’ liquidity risk appetite; and
                  e)   regular review by the banks’ Boards (at least annually) and appropriate adjustment of
                       the banks’ strategy, policies and processes for the management of liquidity risk in the
                       light of the banks’ changing risk profile and external developments in the markets
                       and macroeconomic conditions in which they operate.

Description and   The BRSA’s liquidity framework addresses each of the elements enumerated above. Please
findings re EC4   also refer to EC 1-3 above. Liquidity is comprehensively addressed through both the
                  offsite and onsite (CAMELS review/GAR process) supervisory processes as well as through
                  any specialized examinations deemed necessary. See the description below of the
                  supervisory practice in this area.

                  As mentioned in paragraph 13 of GLRM; the board of directors should develop their
                  liquidity risk appetite in light of the bank's business objectives, strategic direction,
                  financial structure, size in financial system, funding capacity and overall risk appetite.

                  GLRM Paragraph 29 determines that the liquidity risk management policy should take
                  account of a bank's liquidity needs under normal and stressed conditions and cover, at a
                  minimum, the following key aspects:

                                                                                           TURKEY



•    Liquidity risk appetite established by the board of directors;

•    Liquidity risk management strategy—set out the general approach to liquidity
     (including goals and objectives ) and the liquidity risk management policies on
     particular aspects;

•    Liquidity risk management responsibilities including clearly defined authority and
     responsibilities of staff /unit /committee;

•    Liquidity risk management systems: the systems and tools for measuring, monitoring
     and controlling liquidity risk:

a)   the setting of various liquidity limits and ratios (e.g., target liquidity ratio, maturity and
     currency mismatch limits, loan to deposit ratio, concentration risk limits),
b)   the framework for conducting cash-flow analysis under normal and stressed
     economic conditions, including the techniques and behavioral assumptions used, and
c)   reporting system of monitoring liquidity risk management;

•    Contingency plan: the approach and strategies for dealing with various types of
     liquidity crisis;

•    The new product approval process, liquidity costs in pricing and performance
     measuring, risks and profits (Liquidity Transfer Pricing).

According to GLRM Paragraph 24, the board of directors should be informed immediately
of new and emerging concerns mentioned below:

•    increasing funding costs over thresholds,

•    the growing size of a funding gap in different maturities,

•    concentrations in funding sources,

•    negative developments in the markets from which significant funding provided,

•    drying up of alternative funding sources,

•    material or persistent breaches of limits,

•    a significant change/decline in the cushion of unencumbered, highly liquid assets,

•    increasing additional margin calls arising from the potential decline in the market
     price of collateral assets, and

•    changes in external market conditions which should signal future difficulties.

a)   GLRM Principle 5 states that a bank should have a sound process for identifying,
     measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk including projecting cash flows
     arising from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items over an appropriate set of
     time horizons. GLRM Paragraphs 34 to 43 articulate the details of liquidity metrics and
     measurement tools, risk limits, and early warning indicators.




                                                                                               185

         b)   GLRM Principle 10 is about Intraday Liquidity Risk Management and requires banks to
              actively manage their intraday liquidity to meet payment and settlement obligations
              on a timely basis under both normal and stressed economic conditions (paragraphs
              169-175).

         In addition to GLRM Paragraph 6, various paragraphs require banks to manage liquidity
         on a daily basis including monitoring funding requirements and measuring daily cash
         flows (Paragraphs 52, 57, 59, 94, 147, and 172)

         c)   GLRM Paragraph 44 states that banks should have a reliable management
              information system designed to provide the board of directors, senior management
              and other responsible staff with timely and forward-looking information. From GLRM
              Paragraph 45 (what the information systems enable banks to do) to Paragraph 51,
              many aspects of information systems are listed including its importance in
              securitizations or other financial instruments (Paragraph 46), its help for statistical or
              behavioral analysis (Paragraph 47), reporting purposes (Paragraphs 48 and 49).

         In practice, BRSA reviews liquidity adequacy of banks and assesses the quality of liquidity
         management as well as banks’ internal liquidity assessments through several means. As
         mentioned above, the ongoing offsite monitoring process is comprehensive. As well,
         evaluation of liquidity, both the level and management of, is a part of the CAMELS
         review/GARS process conducted each supervisory cycle. Through this process, the
         supervisors review any changes in the bank’s stated risk appetite, policies and procedures,
         level of risk, and any changes in the bank’s overall business strategy. If elevated liquidity
         risk is identified, then the supervisors will initiate a more detailed review of the area. Two
         such specialized examinations were conducted in 2015.

         A more detailed review of liquidity management through specialized examinations was
         reviewed to test implementation. Such specialized reviews begin with the IRA process
         (identified risk assessment). Relevant regulatory ratios will be reviewed, recent cost of
         funds trends (in light of the interest rate environment), any previous actions or
         observations. This helps feed the scope of the specialized examination.

         In the specialized examination, the supervisor looks at the funding base and the mix of
         sources (for example, deposits, repurchase agreements, borrowings including securities
         issued, etc.). Large deposits (concentrations of funds providers) will be reviewed, rates
         paid, deposit volume and rates, available collateral, as well as the liquidity coverage ratio
         calculated by the bank. Scenarios can cover variable deposit outflows, movement in
         correspondent bank accounts, change in loan volume and off-balance sheet
         commitments, etc. Any relevant subsidiaries and their potential cash needs will be
         included. MIS will be reviewed as well as processes which might deserve increased internal
         control or internal audit involvement (such as manually prepared reports, monitoring
         tools, or transactions). If the bank has an oversight committee such as a Liquidity Risk

                  Committee, the supervisors may review its function. Contingency funding/liquidity plans
                  will also be evaluated.

                  However, issues were identified, similar to those cited in CP 17, regarding the need for
                  examiners to go further with their evaluations to assess the implications on internal
                  systems and the bank(s) governance processes. For instance, the impact of a bank’s
                  funding positions, and shifts therein, relative to the configuration of the balance sheet
                  (high asset growth, nature and risk of growth, overall credit quality, loan: deposit ratio,
                  etc.) should be evaluated and clearly presented. Linkages to conclusions on management
                  and internal systems should be more explicitly provided.

EC5               The supervisor requires banks to establish, and regularly review, funding strategies and
                  policies and processes for the ongoing measurement and monitoring of funding
                  requirements and the effective management of funding risk. The policies and processes
                  include consideration of how other risks (e.g., credit, market, operational and reputation
                  risk) may impact the bank’s overall liquidity strategy, and include:

                  a)   an analysis of funding requirements under alternative scenarios;
                  b)   the maintenance of a cushion of high quality, unencumbered, liquid assets that can
                       be used, without impediment, to obtain funding in times of stress;
                  c)   diversification in the sources (including counterparties, instruments, currencies and
                       markets) and tenor of funding, and regular review of concentration limits;
                  d)   regular efforts to establish and maintain relationships with liability holders; and
                  e)   regular assessment of the capacity to sell assets.

Description and   The GLRM addresses each of the funding parameters listed above. For example:
findings re EC5
                  Paragraph 12 requires that senior management and the board of directors should have an
                  adequate understanding of the close links between funding liquidity risk and market
                  liquidity risk as well as how other risks (e.g., credit, market, operational and reputation
                  risks) interact with liquidity risk and affect the liquidity risk management strategy.

                  According to GLRM Paragraph 52, banks should adopt a cash-flow approach in liquidity
                  management that includes conducting regular cash-flow analysis on a range of stress
                  scenarios. Net funding requirements are detailed in paragraphs 57-62. GLRM (Paragraphs
                  131, 135, and 137) states that banks should analyze the funding requirements under
                  various stress scenarios including bank-specific scenarios, general market crisis scenarios,
                  and combined scenarios.

                  GLRM Paragraph 91 requires banks to identify alternative funding sources that may be
                  used to generate liquidity in case of needs, and assess the effectiveness of using such
                  sources in different situations. Banks should assess the effectiveness of selling assets
                  under various situations.

                  GLRM Principle 8 requires banks to maintain a cushion of unencumbered, high quality
                  liquid assets to be held as insurance against a range of liquidity stress scenarios including
                  those that involve the loss or impairment of unsecured and typically available secured




                                                                                                                187

                  funding sources. Paragraphs 144 to 157 clarify the properties of liquidity cushion
                  including size and composition of cushion, characteristics of liquid assets, and operational
                  requirements.

                  GLRM has a separate chapter for funding diversification and market access. Principle 6
                  says that banks should establish a liquidity strategy to diversify the funding sources and
                  maturity effectively and be in a sound relationship with fund providers and strengthen
                  presence in chosen funding markets in order to ensure funding diversification.
                  Paragraph 79 requires banks to determine the concentration limits for each funding
                  sources, assets and maturity segments. In determining the concentration limits, banks
                  should take into account the type of asset and market; the nature of counterparty, issuer
                  and fund provider; maturity; currency; geographical location and economic sector. Banks
                  should avoid any potential concentrations in their reliance on particular funding markets
                  or sources.

                  GLRM Paragraph 97 states that banks should identify and build strong relationships with
                  current and potential investors and providers, even in funding markets facilitated by
                  brokers and other third parties.

                  In Paragraph 92 the importance of market access is emphasized, senior management is
                  made responsible to ensure that market access is being actively managed, monitored and
                  tested by appropriate staff or unit. The following paragraphs 93-96 are related to market
                  presence where the banks are asked to review their established systems and test their
                  presence by borrowing funds even without need.

                  The CAMELS review/GAR process covers a host of issues addressing funding capacity,
                  planning and stress testing. In addition, the sample specialized examination described in
                  EC 4 above specifically evaluated the funding mix, shifts, contingency plans, and
                  alternative sources of funding. Concentrations of funding were evaluated as was overall
                  pricing and any potential shifts in market access.

EC6               The supervisor determines that banks have robust liquidity contingency funding plans to
                  handle liquidity problems. The supervisor determines that the bank’s contingency funding
                  plan is formally articulated, adequately documented and sets out the bank’s strategy for
                  addressing liquidity shortfalls in a range of stress environments without placing reliance
                  on lender of last resort support. The supervisor also determines that the bank’s
                  contingency funding plan establishes clear lines of responsibility, includes clear
                  communication plans (including communication with the supervisor) and is regularly
                  tested and updated to ensure it is operationally robust. The supervisor assesses whether,
                  in the light of the bank’s risk profile and systemic importance, the bank’s contingency
                  funding plan is feasible and requires the bank to address any deficiencies.

Description and   GLRM has a separate chapter for contingency funding plan (CFP) which is defined in
findings re EC6   article 3 and explained in detail in article 13 of RICAAP. GLRM, Principle 12 requires banks
                  to have a formal CFP that clearly sets out the strategies for addressing liquidity shortfalls

in emergency situations. GLRM Paragraph 184 points out that the board of directors
should approve the CFP.

GLRM Paragraph 186 states that the CFP should contain a set of policies, procedures and
action plans that prepare a bank to deal with the relevant liquidity stress events assumed
in the stress tests with clearly established lines of responsibility and invocation and
escalation procedures. GLRM Paragraph 187 ensures that the CFP should be
commensurate with a bank's complexity, risk profile, scope of operations and role in the
financial system. The design of a CFP, including its action plans and procedures, should be
closely integrated with the bank's ongoing analysis of liquidity risk, and with the results of
the scenarios and assumptions used in stress tests.

GLRM Paragraph 189 points out that the CFP should articulate available potential
contingency funding sources, along with the estimated amount of funds that can be
derived from these sources, their expected degree of reliability, under what conditions
these sources should be used and the lead time needed to tap additional funds from each
of the sources.

GLRM Paragraphs 193 and 194 state that lender of last resort support should be
considered as secondary sources of liquidity and banks should not assume that such
support is automatically available to them during a crisis even if they have the eligible
collateral.

GLRM Paragraph 196 says that the CFP should contain clear policies and procedures
enabling a bank's management to make timely and appropriate decisions, communicate
the decisions effectively and execute contingency measures swiftly and proficiently.
Additionally, the roles and responsibilities and internal procedures for crisis management
should be defined.

GLRM Paragraph 200 points out that banks should develop a communication plan to
deliver on a timely basis clear and consistent communication to internal and external
parties including the central bank, the agency, correspondents and custodians, relevant
local or overseas public authorities, major counterparties and customers, payment systems
and other relevant parties.

GLRM Paragraph 202 states that the CFP should be subject to regular testing to ensure its
effectiveness and operational feasibility, particularly in respect of the availability of the
contingency sources of funding listed in it. GLRM Paragraph 205 ensures that senior
management should review and update the CFP regularly, at an acceptable frequency or
more often as business or market circumstances change, to ensure that it remains robust
over time. Also, any changes to the CFP should be properly documented and approved by
the board of directors.

The CAMELS review/GAR process directs the examiner to consider the following when
evaluating the CFP including capital for liquidity risk under ICAAP; roles and
responsibilities under contingency plan; operational risks emerged from deposit and
money market operations; funding risk concentrations and impact on the contingency

                  plan. Contingency funding plans are reviewed during the CAMELS process and as a part of
                  any specialized examinations in this area.

EC7               The supervisor requires banks to include a variety of short-term and protracted bank-
                  specific and market-wide liquidity stress scenarios (individually and in combination), using
                  conservative and regularly reviewed assumptions, into their stress testing programs for
                  risk management purposes. The supervisor determines that the results of the stress tests
                  are used by the bank to adjust its liquidity risk management strategies, policies and
                  positions and to develop effective contingency funding plans.

Description and   According to article 43 of RICAAP, banks shall establish and operate a stress testing
findings re EC7   program in order to measure its material risks and vulnerabilities which may arise from
                  both negative developments peculiar to the bank and the developments in stressed
                  economic and financial environment. More specific guidance to stress testing of liquidity
                  risk is given in GLRM and GST.

                  GLRM has a separate section for stress tests. Principle 7 states that banks should conduct
                  stress tests on a regular basis for a variety of short-term and protracted institution-specific
                  and market-wide stress scenarios individually or in combination, to identify sources of
                  potential liquidity strain and to ensure that current on- and off-balance sheet positions
                  remain in accordance with banks' established liquidity risk appetite. The outcomes should
                  be used to adjust liquidity risk management strategies, policies and positions and to
                  develop effective contingency plans. Paragraph 101 ensures that banks should evaluate
                  the impact of scenarios of stressed economic conditions on consolidated and
                  unconsolidated basis.

                  Additionally, GST has a special reference to liquidity risk. Paragraphs 140 to 149 deal with
                  stress testing on liquidity risk.

                  As mentioned above, review of a bank’s stress tests are an important part of the ICAAP
                  review process (which includes important liquidity considerations), the liquidity review
                  under CAMELS, and as a part of any targeted specialized examinations. The examiners
                  review the scenarios used by the bank and determine if the results are used for
                  management purposes. They also evaluate how results are factored into the contingency
                  plan.

EC8               The supervisor identifies those banks carrying out significant foreign currency liquidity
                  transformation. Where a bank’s foreign currency business is significant, or the bank has
                  significant exposure in a given currency, the supervisor requires the bank to undertake
                  separate analysis of its strategy and monitor its liquidity needs separately for each such
                  significant currency. This includes the use of stress testing to determine the
                  appropriateness of mismatches in that currency and, where appropriate, the setting and
                  regular review of limits on the size of its cash flow mismatches for foreign currencies in
                  aggregate and for each significant currency individually. In such cases, the supervisor also
                  monitors the bank’s liquidity needs in each significant currency, and evaluates the bank’s

Description and   GLRM has a separate section for Foreign Currency Liquidity Management. Paragraph 69
findings re EC8   points out that banks should have adequate systems in place for measuring, monitoring
                  and controlling their liquidity positions in each major currency in which they have
                  significant activity or exposure. Paragraph 71 states that banks should formulate liquidity
                  strategies and policies for all significant currencies and the effectiveness of such strategies
                  and policies should be regularly reviewed. Paragraph 73 clarifies that banks should assess
                  aggregate foreign currency liquidity needs under both normal and stressed business
                  conditions and control currency mismatches within acceptable levels. According to
                  paragraph 75, banks should set and regularly review the limits to control the size of
                  cumulative net mismatches over particular time bands (one day, seven days and one
                  month) for significant currencies.

                  Moreover, GLRM paragraph 103 ensures that stress tests should be performed for
                  separately for significant currencies as well as for all currencies in aggregate.

                  Many banks in the system run large USD banking books and have meaningful foreign
                  currency exposures. To a large extent, these exposures are hedged, though the hedges
                  may be of shorter maturities than the exposures, creating roll over risk which it is
                  important to assess and to manage. The supervisory process, both in the CAMELS
                  review/GAR methodology process and in the specialized examinations as well as through
                  offsite monitoring, is required to address foreign currency exposure management.

                  for the sustainability of their long-term liquidity position. The supervisor requires banks to

Assessment of     Compliant
Principle 24

Comments          The BRSA has set up a comprehensive framework for liquidity regulation, monitoring, and
                  assignment of bank responsibilities. Regulation is in some cases more rigorous than
                  international benchmarks. A wide range of tools is in place for monitoring banks’ liquidity
                  positions and funding experience. The CAMELS review/GAR methodology addresses
                  liquidity, and specialized examinations are conducted when a change in trends or strategy
                  is detected. As well, the BRSA underwent a Regulatory Consistency Assessment of its Basel
                  III LCR regulations for which it received a “compliant” rating.

                     However, review of onsite documents indicated that conclusions regarding liquidity,
                     funding stability, and management processes stopped short of considering other areas of
                     the balance sheet, growth trends, asset quality, and management processes, etc to
                     support conclusions. Such issues are critical to the overall review process and should be
                     captured and clearly conveyed in examination documents to supported supervisory
                     observations. This is particularly important given that some banks may have tight liquidity
                     positions including relatively high loan to deposit ratios.

                     The central bank has taken a number of steps in recent years to support the strengthening
                     of foreign currency funding. There appears to be an opportunity to strengthen liaison
                     between the BRSA and the CBRT on the monitoring and management of foreign liquidity
                     risk. Given the potential foreign exchange roll over risk residing in banks’ positions,
                     consideration could be given to increasing the ultimate target for the FX LCR from 80% to
                     100% to further strengthen the management of liquidity risk.

Principle 25         Operational risk. The supervisor determines that banks have an adequate operational risk
                     management framework that takes into account their risk appetite, risk profile and market
                     and macroeconomic conditions. This includes prudent policies and processes to identify,
                     assess, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate operational risk 66 on a timely
                     basis.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Law, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have appropriate operational risk
                     management strategies, policies and processes to identify, assess, evaluate, monitor,
                     report and control or mitigate operational risk. The supervisor determines that the bank’s
                     strategy, policies and processes are consistent with the bank’s risk profile, systemic
                     importance, risk appetite and capital strength, take into account market and
                     macroeconomic conditions, and address all major aspects of operational risk prevalent in
                     the businesses of the bank on a bank-wide basis (including periods when operational risk
                     could increase).

Description and      BRSA published GORM, 2015, that is prepared based on “Principles for the Sound
findings re EC1      Management of Operational Risk” and other countries’ best practices. The principles
                     contained in this guideline present a comprehensive approach to addressing operational
                     risk within banks. It is prepared as a reference to effectively implement and establish
                     operational risk management systems. As with all regulatory issuances, GORM is intended
                     to be adapted to each bank’s level of size, activity and complexity.

                     Principle 6 of GORM requires banks to have a risk management process and appropriate
                     means to be able to regularly identify, measure, assess, monitor and control the
                     operational risk exposure due to their products, activities, processes and systems.



66The Committee has defined operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events. The definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and
reputational risk.

                        According to Principle 1 of GORM, a bank’s operational risk management framework
                        should determine that operational risks are consistently and comprehensively identified,
                        assessed, controlled, mitigated, monitored and reported. BRSA requires banks to
                        implement the operational risk management framework considering; i) organizational
                        structure (board oversight, senior management, business lines, independent corporate risk
                        management unit, internal control and internal audit), ii) risk culture iii) operational risk
                        management strategies, policies and procedures (including written work flow diagram)
                        and iv) operational risk management process (the processes to identify, assess, monitor,
                        control, mitigate and report operational risk ) and declare the framework in a written
                        document.

                        Section VI of GORM gives requirements for building strategy, policies and procedures
                        regarding operational risk as well as an example of determining operational risk strategy,
                        policies and procedures and corporate strategy of a bank. Article 35 requires that,
                        operational risk management process begins with the determination of the overall
                        strategies and long-term objectives of a bank. Once determined, the bank can identify the
                        associated inherent risks in its strategy and objectives, and thereby establish an
                        operational risk management strategy and develop an operational risk management
                        framework appropriate to all these strategies. Article 36 requires all business units 67 to
                        develop supplementary policies and procedures specific to their business based on and in
                        consistence with the corporate operational risk management framework. It has great
                        importance to establish written work flow diagrams within the procedures.

                        According to paragraph 4 of the GORM, banks should consider these principles in
                        accordance with their capital adequacy, risk profile and risk appetite. As well, a bank’s
                        operational risk management should be commensurate with the organizational structure,
                        size, complexity, risk profile and business line.

                        According to RICAAP Article 53(2) all banks are required to implement a measurement
                        and assessment process to cover Pillar 1 risks including operational risk. Bank reporting to
                        the board of directors on operational risk is detailed in GORM paragraph 45.

                        The level of operational risk in the system is considered moderate by the BRSA. The team
                        was informed that the major sources of operational losses revolve largely around fraud
                        and human error. The sophistication of the operational risk management systems in a
                        bank is considered by the BRSA in relation to the size, complexity, and nature of a bank’s
                        activities and systems. Banks are required to track their loss history over time. Operational
                        loss history/risk must be conveyed through banks’ ICAAP reports. Banks are using either
                        the BIA or STA approach to calculate capital charges.

                        Overall operational risk is assessed largely through the CAMELS review/GAR process. The
                        examiners review all relevant policies, processes and strategies pertaining to operational
                        risk across each relevant unit in the given bank. During this review a range of factors,
                        including, banks size, nature, complexity, capital strength, risk appetite and risk profile are

67   Business units imply basic units such as corporate financing, retail banking etc.

                  taken into consideration. Operational risk is a specific focus element in the preparation of
                  the risk matrix, using the SMRAC procedures.

EC2               The supervisor requires banks’ strategies, policies and processes for the management of
                  operational risk (including the banks’ risk appetite for operational risk) to be approved
                  and regularly reviewed by the banks’ Boards. The supervisor also requires that the Board
                  oversees management in ensuring that these policies and processes are implemented
                  effectively.

Description and   RICAAP regulates general framework for all internal systems and GORM gives
findings re EC2   requirements that is only specific for operational risk. Article 5(2) of RICAAP defines
                  responsibilities of the Board which includes determination and approval of policies,
                  procedures, strategy for each risk type (including operational risk) and also identification
                  of risk appetite. Article 8(2) also gives the responsibility and duty to senior management
                  to implement the strategies and policies approved by the Board. Furthermore, the board
                  of directors is responsible for approving and reviewing a risk appetite and tolerance
                  statement on the basis of general and sub factors (e.g., business line, product, unit) for
                  operational risk that articulates the nature, types and levels of operational risk that the
                  bank is willing to assume and establish the system and processes for implementing these
                  functions (GORM Principle 3).

                  The board of directors are required to oversee that the policies, processes and systems are
                  implemented effectively at all decision levels. For example, GORM paragraph 45 requires
                  regular reporting to the Board on overall status of operational risk in the bank, any
                  particular risk areas or weaknesses, likely impact of major events on the bank’s operational
                  risks, etc. As well, boards should be informed about operational risks that may arise with
                  the introduction of new products.

                  As part of the routine supervision cycle, BRSA determines whether there is a reporting and
                  monitoring process that enables Board of Directors to review limits, policies, procedures
                  and processes concerning operational risk. The GAR process requires the examiners to
                  evaluate whether policies, procedures and work flow diagrams are up to date and
                  approved by Board of Directors.

EC3               The supervisor determines that the approved strategy and significant policies and
                  processes for the management of operational risk are implemented effectively by
                  management and fully integrated into the bank’s overall risk management process.

Description and   As stated in EC2, the Board of Directors are required to establish, approve and periodically
findings re EC3   review the operational risk framework (GORM Principle 2). Strategies, policies and
                  procedures are a part of operational risk framework according to the GORM paragraph 7.

                  Operational risk management process begins with the determination of the overall
                  strategies and long-term objectives of a bank. Once determined, the bank can identify the
                  associated inherent risks in its strategy and objectives, and thereby establish an
                  operational risk management strategy and develop an operational risk management
                  framework appropriate to all these strategies. The risk appetite of the bank and basic

                  elements regarding its management should be determined and documented in the
                  operational risk management frame work (GORM 35). GORM presents an operational
                  example of what such a process may be in paragraph 36.

                  Monitoring process of the operational risk, should be integrated with the bank’s routine
                  activities and in this context the operational risk potential of each business line should be
                  assessed, in this assessment process the frequency and nature of changes in the operating
                  environment should also be taken into account (GORM 44).

                  Banks are required to give detailed information regarding identification, measurement,
                  control and risk appetite of operational risk within their ICAAP reports. These sections are
                  assessed through the CAMELS review/GAR methodology and off-site BRSA audit teams.

EC4               The supervisor reviews the quality and comprehensiveness of the bank’s disaster recovery
                  and business continuity plans to assess their feasibility in scenarios of severe business
                  disruption which might plausibly affect the bank. In so doing, the supervisor determines
                  that the bank is able to operate as a going concern and minimize losses, including those
                  that may arise from disturbances to payment and settlement systems, in the event of
                  severe business disruption.

Description and   RICAAP Article 13 is about business continuity management and plan. Banks must
findings re EC4   establish a business continuity management structure approved by the board of directors
                  in order to ensure the sustainability of activities in case of an interruption or to save them
                  on time to minimize operational, financial, legal and reputational costs.

                  According to GORM Principle 10, banks need to have a business continuity plan to be able
                  to continue their activities on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe
                  business disruption. Negative condition scenarios created by the bank should be assessed
                  for their financial, operational and reputational impact and the resulting risk assessment
                  should be the foundation for recovery priorities and objectives (GORM paragraph 71).

                  Each bank should establish business continuity plans considering their size, activity nature,
                  and complexity of their processes. These plans should outline possible responses
                  according to different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the bank may be
                  vulnerable. Some of the possible events may include incidents that damage or render
                  accessibility to the bank’s facilities, telecommunication or information technology
                  infrastructures, or events that affect human resources as well as broader disruptions to the
                  financial system altogether (GORM Paragraph 70). Continuity plans should be tested
                  periodically including preparation of an impact analysis (GORM paragraph 71).

                  All the disaster recovery and business continuity plans are tested at least once in a year
                  according to RICAAP article 13. These tests are reviewed by BRSA on-site examination
                  teams during the GAR process once a year. Examiners are required to determine if there is
                  a business continuity plan approved by Board of Directors and if this plan is tested by the
                  bank. As well, they check to see if the business continuity plan contains the policies,
                  responsibilities and duties during business disruption cases.

EC5               The supervisor determines that banks have established appropriate IT policies and
                  processes to identify, assess, monitor and manage technology risks. The supervisor also
                  determines that banks have appropriate and sound IT infrastructure to meet their current

                  Regarding IT, the BRSA requires banks to receive an IT audit every 2 years by the bank’s
                  external auditor. The team was informed that most internal audit departments in banks
                  have some resource in this area. The BRSA has IT specialists who review external audit’s IT
                  reports, conduct their own examinations, and participate in the CAMELS onsite
                  examinations as needed. On occasion, they may participate in MIS reviews conducted by
                  the commercial examiners. They evaluate the external audits and also conduct their own
                  examinations. The questions contained in GAR are relatively high level for which answers
                  are derived primarily from the external audit IT report or are referred to the BRSA’s IT
                  department.

EC6               The supervisor determines that banks have appropriate and effective information systems
                  to:

                  a)    monitor operational risk;
                  b)    compile and analyze operational risk data; and
                  c)    facilitate appropriate reporting mechanisms at the banks’ Boards, senior management
                        and business line levels that support proactive management of operational risk.

                  In RICAAP Article 21(3) requires internal audit system of banks to review information
                  systems including electronic information system and electronic banking services and it
                  also evaluates the accuracy and reliability of accounting records and financial reports.

                  Additionally, RICAAP Article 57 (1) internal audit system should review the adequacy of
                  the system and processes and accuracy of the data used in the ICAAP Reports and send
                  their findings to BRSA according to Article 63 (5).

Description and   Section IV of RCA is about calculation of RWA for operational risk for regulatory capital.
findings re EC7   The calculations are submitted to BRSA via two annual supervisory reports
                  (OR500YS/OR500YK).

                  The reporting mechanisms for operational risk are viewed through the CAMELS review
                  process/GAR methodology by on-site BRSA examiners as well. During relevant special
                  examinations, examiners are required to evaluate certain systems and reporting. For
                  example, examiners are required to determine if there is a system for reporting
                  operational risks on SME, corporate, commercial loans (regarding incorrect operations,
                  abuse, suspicious financial transactions). During the review of sample special
                  examinations, the team observed issues and deficiencies in these areas cited and
                  communicated in the reports and to bank management.

                  It is required that banks send their ICAAP reports to BRSA once in a year since 2013. Banks
                  have to provide sufficient information about both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 risks at ICAAAP
                  report. In this context all banks have to give information about identification,
                  measurement, management, control, risk appetite and risk limits. All ICAAP reports are
                  evaluated by BRSA. Banks also must report their operational loss history to the BRSA.

EC8               The supervisor determines that banks have established appropriate policies and processes
                  to assess, manage and monitor outsourced activities. The outsourcing risk management
                  program covers:

                  a)   conducting appropriate due diligence for selecting potential service providers;
                  b)   structuring the outsourcing arrangement;
                  c)   managing and monitoring the risks associated with the outsourcing arrangement;
                  d)   ensuring an effective control environment; and
                  e)   establishing viable contingency planning.

                  Outsourcing policies and processes require the bank to have comprehensive contracts
                  and/or service level agreements with a clear allocation of responsibilities between the
                  outsourcing provider and the bank.

Description and   According to the Article 35 of BL, the banks will, before outsourcing certain allowable
findings re EC8   activities, prepare a written report to be submitted to the Agency if and when it is
                  required, containing the probable risks of outsourcing services to be received, and
                  management of such risks, as well as the expected benefits and costs thereof.

                  The Article 5 (1) of Regulation on Receiving Outsourcing Services by Banks (RROS) states
                  that banks contracting outsourcing services are obliged to:

                  a)   Identify needed outsourcing services in each relevant area;
                  b)   Studies for necessary transformation, internal regulation, infrastructure and training at
                       the stage of transition to outsourcing services,

                  c)   Coordination of responsibilities concerning the issues of supervision, measurement
                       and evaluation, reporting and security in connection with outsourcing services




                                                                                                             197

                  d)   Risks that may have arisen from receiving outsourcing activities and a contingency
                       plan to be implemented in case of any interruptions or delays in services in any
                       manner along with the management of these risks and substitutability of received
                       outsourcing services
                  e)   The impact of outsourced areas on the internal control, internal audit, and risk
                       management to be done by the bank for operations and process that are related to
                       thereof.
                  According to the Article 7 of RROS it is obligatory that the contracts to be signed between
                  the banks and of outsourcing service providers must explicitly state issues such as the
                  subject matter, scope and term of outsourcing services, fees to be paid for services and
                  responsibilities of the parties.

                  Within the scope of the above mentioned rules, BRSA examines compliance to these
                  regulations. There is a specific question about this EC in the annex of GAR module. FSAID
                  2495 requires BRSA on-site examination teams to asses if there is an effective monitoring
                  and controlling system of operational risk arising from outsourcing activities. While
                  answering the question above-mentioned BRSA examiners sources are indicated in GAR
                  module as below;

                  •    Due diligence activities,

                  •    Outsourcing contracts,

                  •    Activities to manage and monitor the risk arising from outsourcing activities,

Additional
criteria

AC1               The supervisor regularly identifies any common points of exposure to operational risk or
                  potential vulnerability (e.g., outsourcing of key operations by many banks to a common
                  service provider or disruption to outsourcing providers of payment and settlement
                  activities).

Principle 25

Comments          Oversight of operational risk is anchored in RICAAP and further expanded in the GORM
                  which comprehensively addresses relevant aspects of this risk. The supervisory process
                  explicitly addresses this risk through the evaluation of the ICAAP process and reports
                  submitted by banks as well as through the GAR process and as a part of MIS evaluation
                  and controls during specialized examinations.

Principle 26         Internal control and audit. The supervisor determines that banks have adequate internal
                     control frameworks to establish and maintain a properly controlled operating
                     environment for the conduct of their business taking into account their risk profile. These
                     include clear arrangements for delegating authority and responsibility; separation of the
                     functions that involve committing the bank, paying away its funds, and accounting for its
                     assets and liabilities; reconciliation of these processes; safeguarding the bank’s assets; and
                     appropriate independent 68 internal audit and compliance functions to test adherence to
                     these controls as well as applicable laws and regulations.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to have internal control
                     frameworks that are adequate to establish a properly controlled operating
                     environment for the conduct of their business, taking into account their risk
                     profile. These controls are the responsibility of the bank’s Board and/or senior
                     management and deal with organizational structure, accounting policies and
                     processes, checks and balances, and the safeguarding of assets and investments
                     (including measures for the prevention and early detection and reporting of
                     misuse such as fraud, embezzlement, unauthorized trading and computer
                     intrusion). More specifically, these controls address:

                     a) organizational structure: definitions of duties and responsibilities, including
                        clear delegation of authority (e.g., clear loan approval limits), decision-making
                        policies and processes, separation of critical functions (e.g., business
                        origination, payments, reconciliation, risk management, accounting, audit and
                        compliance);
                     b) accounting policies and processes: reconciliation of accounts, control lists,
                        information for management;
                     c) checks and balances (or “four eyes principle”): segregation of duties, cross-
                        checking, dual control of assets, double signatures; and
                     d) safeguarding assets and investments: including physical control and
                        computer access.

Description and      Mainly, the BL and RICAAP regulate the issues regarding internal control and audit
findings re EC1      systems. In addition to these two, RCGB establishes the responsibilities of the board and
                     senior management with respect to corporate governance to ensure that there is effective
                     control over a bank‘s entire business.

                     Article 23, 29 of the BL states that banks are obliged to establish and operate adequate
                     and efficient internal control, risk management and internal audit systems that are in
                     harmony with the scope and structure of their activities, that can respond to changing

68 In assessing independence, supervisors give due regard to the control systems designed to avoid conflicts of
interest in the performance measurement of staff in the compliance, control and internal audit functions. For
example, the remuneration of such staff should be determined independently of the business lines that they oversee.



                                                                                                                199

         conditions and that cover all their branches and undertakings subject to consolidation in
         order to monitor and control the risks that they encounter. These systems should be
         compliant with relevant legislation, secure financial reporting systems, and assign
         authorities and responsibilities in the bank. These duties are further expanded in RICAAP.

         Further, BL article 30 requires that banks:

         (i) ensure the execution of their activities in compliance with the legislation, bank’s internal
         regulations and banking ethics;

         (ii) secure the integrity and reliability of accounting and reporting systems and timely
         accessibility of information through continuous control activities to be complied with and
         performed by the personnel at any level;

         (iii) ensure the functional separation of the duties and the sharing of powers and
         responsibilities regarding the payments of funds, the reconciliation of bank‘s transactions,
         safeguarding assets and controlling liabilities;

         (iv) identify and evaluate any risk encountered and prepare the infrastructure required for
         managing such risks; and

         (v) construct an adequate network for information exchange.

         Pursuant to the same article, internal control checks are required to be carried out by the
         internal control department; the internal control personnel must work under the board of
         directors. RICAAP further establishes reporting to the BRSA expands the obligations and
         requirements of BL article 30 cited above including requirements for independent internal
         audit and compliance functions to test adherence to these controls.

         The BRSA follows a dynamic supervisory approach with a risk-focused point of view in
         order to ensure the efficiency, continuity and adequacy of the supervision process and
         efficient usage of supervision resources. Article 5 of the RAA defines the risk focused
         supervision approach. The RFS approach aims to configure the scope and intensity of the
         supervision as well as the allocation of supervision resources and supervision activities
         taking into consideration the risk profile, the existence and adequacy of internal control
         and risk management systems of the institutions subject to the regulation and supervision
         of the BRSA.

         During the ICAAP examinations, the BRSA reviews the quality of the bank’s risk
         management, internal control and internal audit functions pursuant to section 4 of the
         GAA.

         The CAMELS review/GAR process addresses internal systems, controls and internal audit in
         various areas. Special inspections also involve checks of internal controls as relevant.
         Internal Systems is defined as one of the main activity fields to be examined if it is
         assessed as a risky field by the on-site examination teams. However, see BCP principle
         14/15 for issues on conclusions drawn during the supervisory process.

EC2                 The supervisor determines that there is an appropriate balance in the skills and resources
                    of the back office, control functions and operational management relative to the business
                    origination units. The supervisor also determines that the staff of the back office and
                    control functions have sufficient expertise and authority within the organization (and,
                    where appropriate, in the case of control functions, sufficient access to the bank’s Board)
                    to be an effective check and balance to the business origination units.

Description and     On-site examination teams review and determine whether the personnel responsible for
findings re EC2     control functions have sufficient skills and expertise. For example, questions in the GAR
                    process address the sufficiency, effectiveness and frequency of the training activities
                    surrounding anti-money laundering control activities. As well, steps in the GAR process
                    direct the examiner to evaluate the follow-up mechanism for deficiencies cited in internal
                    control and audit reports including to what extent the findings in these reports are
                    corrected by relevant business units. Evaluation of the control functions and back office
                    activities are guided by the GAR process as well as tested during special inspections. For
                    example, review of several special inspection reports and procedures revealed
                    shortcomings in the areas of internal controls and reporting. As well the GAR process
                    directs examiners to determine if the performance of internal systems personnel is
                    assessed by the board and not by the executive units of the bank. This is to provide the
                    basis for assessing the independence of the internal systems personnel. During these
                    processes, shortcomings and staffing issues with internal control staff as well as
                    operational staff are able to be identified.

                    During the preparation of the risk matrix (one of the end products of the supervisory

EC3                 The supervisor determines that banks have an adequately staffed, permanent and
                    independent compliance function 69 that assists senior management in managing
                    effectively the compliance risks faced by the bank. The supervisor determines that staff
                    within the compliance function is suitably trained, have relevant experience and have
                    sufficient authority within the bank to perform their role effectively. The supervisor
                    determines that the bank’s Board exercises oversight of the management of the
                    compliance function.

Description and     Pursuant to Article 5(1) of the RICAAP, the board of directors has the ultimate
findings re EC3     responsibility for the establishment and sufficient and effective functioning of the internal
                    systems.

                    Article 4(2) of RICAAP requires banks to establish their internal systems directly linked to

                    they are not obliged to according to RICAAP regulation, banks generally have separate
                    compliance units directly connected to the Board of Directors. On-site examination teams
                    assess the compliance of the bank’s internal systems with this regulation.

                         management, compliance and corporate governance processes) are effective,
                         appropriate and remain sufficient for the bank’s business; and
                    b)   ensuring that policies and processes are complied with.

Description and     All banks are required to have independent and adequately functioning internal audit
findings re EC4     departments. As mentioned in EC2 and EC3, the BRSA evaluates the independence,
                    permanence and effectiveness of the internal systems of the bank. All these assessments
                    are valid for internal audit function as well. As a result, guided by the GAR methodology,
                    on-site examination teams assess the independence of internal audit function as they
                    assess the independence of internal systems. As well, examiners determine whether
                    internal audit activities are effectively and sufficiently covered on a consolidated basis.

                    The GAR process also directs review of reports submitted to the board (audit committee).
                    On-site examiners take into consideration the effectiveness of policies, process and
                    internal controls while responding to these questions.

EC5                 The supervisor determines that the internal audit function:

                    a) has sufficient resources, and staff that are suitably trained and have relevant
                       experience to understand and evaluate the business they are auditing;
                    b) has appropriate independence with reporting lines to the bank’s Board or to
                       an audit committee of the Board, and has status within the bank to ensure
                       that senior management reacts to and acts upon its recommendations;

                    c)   is kept informed in a timely manner of any material changes made to the bank’s risk
                         management strategy, policies or processes;
                    d)   has full access to and communication with any member of staff as well as full access
                         to records, files or data of the bank and its affiliates, whenever relevant to the
                         performance of its duties;
                    e)   employs a methodology that identifies the material risks run by the bank;


70The term “internal audit function” does not necessarily denote an organizational unit. Some countries allow small
banks to implement a system of independent reviews, e.g., conducted by external experts, of key internal controls as
an alternative.

                  f)   prepares an audit plan, which is reviewed regularly, based on its own risk assessment
                       and allocates its resources accordingly; and
                  g)   has the authority to assess any outsourced functions.

Description and   With respect to (a); Article 5(2)(ç) of RICAAP requires the board of directors to ensure the
findings re EC5   allocation of sufficient resources for the units in internal systems of the bank. Additionally,
                  RICAAP 22(3) (c) states that the manager of the internal audit unit is obliged to assess
                  whether the internal auditors have the qualifications required by their powers and
                  responsibilities, prepare training programs to improve their professional knowledge, skills
                  and abilities, and monitor whether they are performing their duties independently and
                  objectively with the necessary professional diligence and attention.

                  With respect to b), the BRSA legislation involves several provisions on the independence
                  of internal auditors. As previously mentioned, the internal audit function, being a part of
                  the internal systems of the bank, shall be directly under the board of directors. Further,
                  Article 23(1) of RICAAP stipulates that the internal auditors are required to perform their
                  duties and responsibilities objectively and independently. To this end, they shall not be
                  accountable to anyone in the bank management other than the manager of the internal
                  audit unit, the relevant internal systems manager and the board of directors and, in the
                  performance of their duties, they are required to be free from any conflicts of interest
                  stemming from reasons such as personal or family relations or their position within the
                  bank. Audit findings are submitted to the audit committee and to the board of directors
                  through the audit committee as well as the follow-up of the corrective actions pursued by
                  the department subject to the audit.

                  With respect to (c), article 26(5) of RICAAP, states that the risk evaluations shall be
                  regularly reviewed. Events that may affect the risk evaluations such as new products, new
                  systems, changes to the Law and other applicable legislation, and changes in organization
                  or personnel in important positions, vertical changes in volume and amount of activities
                  shall be communicated by unit managers to the internal audit unit, which shall in turn
                  review the risk evaluations in the light of such changes.

                  With respect to (d), Article 23(3) of RICAAP requires the board of directors to ensure that
                  the internal auditors are properly authorized to access all units of the bank, to obtain
                  information from any personnel of the bank, and to have access to all records, files and
                  data of the bank, so that they may effectively perform their duties and responsibilities.

                  With respect to (e), Article 26 of the ICAAP requires banks to effectively perform their
                  internal audit activities following a risk focused approach, based on the risk assessments
                  of the internal audit unit. In that context, risk assessments, made on an annual basis,
                  requires the utilization of risk measurement and rating systems to assess the activity and
                  control risks in significant business units and products and to determine their materiality.

                  With respect to (f), Article 27 of the RICAAP include provisions on internal audit plans. In
                  that context, internal audit plans are required to be prepared on the basis of the risk
                  assessments made pursuant to Article 26 and to allocation of resources of the internal

                      audit department. The internal audit plans can be reviewed and updated by the assent of
                      the board of directors.

                      With respect to (g) Article 7(2)(o) of the RICAAP stipulates that members of the audit
                      committee are responsible for making risk assessments about the support services
                      received by the bank, for submitting their assessments to the board of directors and,
                      monitoring the sufficiency of the support service provided to the bank.

                      Internal audit is assessed by the on-site examination teams through the CAMELS
                      review/GAR methodology during the course of the supervisory cycle. Among the aspects
                      evaluated in this area, the examiners i) review audit plans in comparison to previous years
                      plans as well as relative to the understood risks of the bank; ii) review audit reports
                      (including loan audits, branch reports, etc.); iii) staff adequacy and turnover as well a
                      budget sufficiency; iv) training received; iv) audit access to business units and internal
                      functions, etc. Observations and views on internal audit are factored into the CAMELS
                      ratings process through the “M”.

Assessment of         Compliant
Principle 26

Comments              The legal framework is comprehensive in this area, both as it is articulated in the
                      requirements for internal systems and separately as requirements specifically directed to
                      the internal audit function. Review of the internal audit process is an important part of the
                      onsite (GAR) process covered each supervisory cycle. However, targeted or specialized
                      examinations of the internal audit process, leveraging the GAR results as well as
                      specialized examination results as partial inputs, could enhance the validation of this
                      important function. Such validation by the BRSA is important in order for it to maintain or
                      increase the degree of confidence (and therefore, dependence) it can place in audit
                      outputs as early warning indicators of shifting risk.

Principle 27          Financial reporting and external audit. The supervisor determines that banks and
                      banking groups maintain adequate and reliable records, prepare financial statements in
                      accordance with accounting policies and practices that are widely accepted internationally
                      and annually publish information that fairly reflects their financial condition and
                      performance and bears an independent external auditor’s opinion. The supervisor also
                      determines that banks and parent companies of banking groups have adequate
                      governance and oversight of the external audit function.

Essential criteria

ensuring that financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting policies and practices may also be
vested with securities and market supervisors.

                  that are widely accepted internationally and that these are supported by recordkeeping
                  systems in order to produce adequate and reliable data.

Description and   BL article 39 requires the financial reports prepared by banks to be signed, with names,
findings re EC1   surnames and titles indicated, by the chairman of the board of directors, the members of
                  the audit committee, general manager, deputy general manager responsible for financial
                  reporting as well as the relevant unit manager or equivalent authorities, declaring that the
                  financial report is in compliance with the legislation pertaining to financial reporting and
                  with the accounting records.

                  Additionally, BL article 37 requires banks, in line with the principles and procedures to be
                  determined by the Board in consultation with POA and associations of institutions, to
                  account all transactions in an accurate manner and to present financial reports in a clear,
                  reliable, and comparable way. In cases where it is determined that the financial statements
                  have been mispresented, the BRSB shall be authorized to take necessary measures.

                  Based on the BL, the RAP brings the Turkish banking system‘s accounting practices in line
                  with the TFRS which are issued by the POA as the Turkish translations of the IFRS. There
                  are 2 notable differences in the implementation of TFRS in banks and financial institutions
                  with IFRS: 1) a bank group’s consolidated accounts capture the financial subsidiaries but
                  not the nonfinancial subsidiaries, and 2) loan loss provisions reflect the BRSA’s
                  requirements. Banks will be required to implement the upcoming IFRS 9 for provisioning
                  in line with the timeframe specified by the standards.

EC2               The supervisor holds the bank’s Board and management responsible for ensuring that the
                  financial statements issued annually to the public bear an independent external auditor’s
                  opinion as a result of an audit conducted in accordance with internationally accepted
                  auditing practices and standards.

Description and   According to BL article 39 (2), the annual financial reports to be presented by banks to
findings re EC2   their general assembly, are required to be approved by independent audit firms. Article 4
                  (2) of the REAB requires independent auditing firms to conduct their audits in banks in
                  alignment with the principles and procedures stipulated in the Turkish Auditing Standards
                  (TSAs) which are issued as Turkish translation of International Standards of Audit (ISAs). In
                  addition, article 4(4) of the REAB requires banks to have their quarterly financial
                  statements audited by independent audit firms in compliance with the provisions laid
                  down in REAB as well as the TSAs. In that context, financial statements of banks are
                  required to be subject to interim limited audit as of the end of March, June and
                  September and to annual full-scope audit as of the end of December.

EC3               The supervisor determines that banks use valuation practices consistent with accounting
                  standards widely accepted internationally. The supervisor also determines that the
                  framework, structure and processes for fair value estimation are subject to independent
                  verification and validation, and that banks document any significant differences between
                  the valuations used for financial reporting purposes and for regulatory purposes.

Description and   BRSA published GFVM in order to explain the best practices for determining the fair value
findings re EC3   of financial instruments as well as the associated risk management and internal
                  procedures. Banks are required to classify and report financial instruments in their
                  financial reports in alignment with relevant accounting and regulatory reporting
                  requirements.

                  Further, GFVM paragraph 23 that any models used in the valuation process (internally
                  developed or purchased from external sources), including any material changes made in
                  the model, are required to be validated and regularly reviewed by an independent expert,
                  both before it is used initially as well as during its use. The independent validation team
                  should have reporting lines independent of risk taking units. The GFVM goes on to
                  provide baseline parameters that should be addressed as a part of the validation process.

                  GFVM paragraph 29 also requires internal and external audit to review the control
                  environment, the availability and reliability of information used in the valuation process,
                  and the reliability of estimated fair values. External and internal audit should include the
                  price verification processes and testing valuations of significant transactions. Audit
                  programs should also evaluate whether the disclosures about fair values made by the
                  bank are in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.

                  Paragraph 35 of GFVM states that any significant differences between fair values included
                  in financial reporting and those used for risk management purposes or used in regulatory
                  reporting, should be reported to the senior management. In cases where there is material
                  uncertainty surrounding the valuation practices, the BRSA may consider conducting tests
                  on portfolio valuations.

                  As a part of its supervisory process, the BRSA evaluates a bank’s financial instruments
                  valuation practices incorporating relevant governance, risk management, and control
                  practices and takes these evaluations into consideration when assessing capital adequacy.
                  This includes an evaluation of the process of valuation including reviewing the pricing
                  information used in the process, surrounding control environment, and determining the
                  impact of the valuations on capital adequacy. The examiners also verify audit coverage of
                  the processes and management’s response to any cited deficiencies. On-site examination
                  teams also assess whether bank management adequately understands the valuation
                  methodologies and calculations. The examiners also assess if computer systems are used
                  in the valuation of banks’ securities and derivatives portfolios are validated by
                  independent teams.

                  In addition, the assessment team reviewed an example of a special check on valuation and
                  transaction activity the BRSA conducted. The objective of the review was to determine the
                  propriety and risk involved in certain business areas. Thorough review of the valuation
                  process was conducted.

findings re EC4        Accordingly, external audit of banks is to be carried out in accordance with the TSAs which
                       is the Turkish version of the ISAs, to provide a fair assurance on reliability and accuracy of
                       financial statements as well as accounting and recording systems, including assessment of
                       compliance, adequacy and effectiveness of banks’ internal and financial reporting systems.
                       Also, BRSA is authorized to require banks or external auditors to initiate a special purpose
                       external audit on specific matters regulated in the BL and related regulations, or on
                       specific subjects of importance to be determined by BRSA.

                       TSA 320 72, Turkish version of ISA 320, Materiality in Planning and Performing an Audit,
                       regulates the responsibility of auditors to apply the concept of materiality in planning and
                       performing an audit of financial statements. Paragraph 5 of the annex of TSA 320 states
                       that “The concept of materiality is applied by the auditor both in planning and performing
                       the audit, and in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and of
                       uncorrected misstatements, if any, on the financial statements and in forming the opinion
                       in the auditor’s report.” and materiality and audit risk is explained in paragraph A1.

EC5                    Supervisory guidelines or local auditing standards determine that audits cover areas such
                       as the loan portfolio, loan loss provisions, non-performing assets, asset valuations, trading
                       and other securities activities, derivatives, asset securitizations, consolidation of and other
                       involvement with off-balance sheet vehicles and the adequacy of internal controls over
                       financial reporting.

Description and        See also EC 1 & 2 enumerating use of TFRS and TSA standards in the auditing and
findings re EC5        accounting process. Article 4 of the REAB stipulates that the external audit of banks is
                       conducted with the purpose of providing an opinion with regard to the accuracy and
                       reliability of the accounts, records and financial statements of banks as well as their
                       compliance with all relevant regulations issued pursuant to the BL. Article 17 covers the
                       issues related to the assessment of the adequacy of internal controls over financial
                       reporting of banks. As a consequence, external audit covers all areas mentioned in EC5.

                       As well, in the process of scoping and conducting CAMELS review/GAR methodology
                       process, the external auditors’ IT audit reports and consolidated and non-consolidated

Description and       The POA sets financial reporting and auditing standards in compliance with international
findings re EC6       standards. BL articles 15 and 33 empower the BRSA to authorize or terminate the
                      appointment of banks’ external audit firms.

                      BL article 15, 33 authorizes the BRSA to evaluate and publish the names of audit firms
                      deemed acceptable to conduct audits in banks. The BRSB has the power to remove the
                      external audit firm from the list when it is deemed to have inadequate expertise or
                      independence, or when it is not subject to or does not adhere to established professional
                      standards.

EC7                   The supervisor determines that banks rotate their external auditors (either the firm or
                      individuals within the firm) from time to time.

Description and       Article 26 (1) (ç) of the Regulation on Independent Audit (RIA 73) issued by the POA states
findings re EC7       that external audit firms and auditors are not allowed to undertake the audits for the
                      entities for which they have conducted the audit activity for seven years within the last ten
                      years for audit firms and five years within the last seven years for auditors, including the
                      ones employed at an audit firm, prior to the extinction of a three-year period following
                      the date of the last audit.

EC8                   The supervisor meets periodically with external audit firms to discuss issues of common
                      interest relating to bank operations.

Description and       The BRSA started meeting with external auditors last year. The first meeting was held
findings re EC8       February 2015 and included 4 international firms and two domestic external auditing
                      firms. Prior to that, BRSA had, on occasion, met with selected firms when important issues
                      of common interest arose. As well, on-site examination teams meet with external auditing
                      teams in the bank(s) frequently to discuss the issues of common interest. These meetings
                      are arranged by on-site examiners when necessary.

EC9                   The supervisor requires the external auditor, directly or through the bank, to report to the
                      supervisor matters of material significance, for example failure to comply with the
                      licensing criteria or breaches of banking or other laws, significant deficiencies and control
                      weaknesses in the bank’s financial reporting process or other matters that they believe are
                      likely to be of material significance to the functions of the supervisor. Laws or regulations
                      provide that auditors who make any such reports in good faith cannot be held liable for
                      breach of a duty of confidentiality.

Description and       BL article 33 (2) directs “If, during their audits, external audit firms detect any matter that
findings re EC9       may endanger the existence of the bank or an evidence demonstrating that their
                      managers have severely violated the Law or the articles of association, the external audit
                      firms shall promptly notify the BRSA thereof. Such notification does not mean the

Additional
criteria

AC1                  The supervisor has the power to access external auditors’ working papers, where
                     necessary.

Assessment of        Compliant
Principle 27

Comments             Procedures surrounding financial reporting and external audit are well established.
                     Accounting standards closely follow IFRS and provisioning standards are set to dovetail
                     with the implementation of IFRS 9. Valuation procedures for financial assets are
                     comprehensive. BRSA conducts review of valuation procedures and of valuation models as
                     a part of the onsite examination process. Parameters for banks’ external audit process are
                     well established.

Principle 28         Disclosure and transparency. The supervisor determines that banks and banking groups
                     regularly publish information on a consolidated and, where appropriate, solo basis that is
                     easily accessible and fairly reflects their financial condition, performance, risk exposures,
                     risk management strategies and corporate governance policies and processes.

Essential criteria

EC1                  Laws, regulations or the supervisor require periodic public disclosures 74 of information by
                     banks on a consolidated and, where appropriate, solo basis that adequately reflect the
                     bank’s true financial condition and performance, and adhere to standards promoting
                     comparability, relevance, reliability and timeliness of the information disclosed.

Description and      According to the BL article 37 banks are required to prepare their financial reports which
findings re EC1      include financial statements and disclosure in accordance with TASs and TFRSs (Turkish
                     version of IASs and IFRSs) published by the POA. Article 10 of the RAP states that the
                     year-end financial report includes financial statements, supplemental information required
                     by the BRSA, and the external audit report. Article 14 of the RAP regulates rules and
                     procedures on publication of banks’ financial reports. Additionally, pursuant to Articles 1
                     and 4(4) of the CPD, banks are required to prepare their public disclosures on a solo and
                     consolidated basis quarterly and annually.


74 For the purposes of this Essential Criterion, the disclosure requirement may be found in applicable accounting,

stock exchange listing, or other similar rules, instead of or in addition to directives issued by the supervisor.



                                                                                                                     209

EC2               The supervisor determines that the required disclosures include both qualitative and
                  quantitative information on a bank’s financial performance, financial position, risk
                  management strategies and practices, risk exposures, aggregate exposures to related
                  parties, transactions with related parties, accounting policies, and basic business,
                  management, governance and remuneration. The scope and content of information
                  provided and the level of disaggregation and detail is commensurate with the risk profile
                  and systemic importance of the bank.

Description and   Pursuant to BL article 40, banks are required to prepare annual reports that contain
findings re EC2   information about banks’ status, management and organization structures, human
                  resources, activities, financial situations, assessment of the management and expectations
                  from the future; together with financial statements, summary of board of directors’ report
                  and external auditing report. These annual reports are utilized during the planning phase
                  of on-site supervision.

                  As well, other parameters for disclosure are covered in the RPPAP (Regulation on
                  Principles and Procedures Concerning the Preparation and Publishing of Annual Reports),
                  RAP (Regulation for Accounting Practices), CPD (Communique on Financial Statements
                  Disclosed to the Public by Banks), and CDRM (Communique on Disclosures about Risk
                  Management).

                  CPD article 4 stipulates the composition of financial statements: balance sheet, off balance
                  sheet items, income statement, table concerning the income and expenses items
                  recognized as equity, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flow, and
                  statement of profit distribution.

                  The structure of the bank and its basic business lines are required to be disclosed
                  including the structure of the bank and the consolidated organization, capital structure of
                  the parent bank and others, activities of the parent bank, risk exposures, transactions with
                  related parties, and accounting policies. Risk disclosures are governed by articles 7-15.

                  RPPAP and RAP require banks to prepare and disclose annual reports and interim reports
                  (quarterly). RPPAP article 6 (1) (b) addresses additional, nonfinancial information to be
                  disclosed such corporate governance practices within the bank, intra-company
                  transactions, etc.

                  CDRM, entering into force March 2016 focuses on the individual and consolidated risk
                  management information to be disclosed by banks. This Communiqué is prepared in
                  alignment with Basel Pillar III disclosure requirements. Risk management disclosure
                  requirements in this Communiqué are complementary to the other disclosure
                  requirements stated in the third section of CPD.

                  Remuneration disclosures laid out by GBCP should be provided as a part of Pillar III
                  disclosures required by CDRM in accordance with the general principles and procedures
                  set out in that Communiqué. Banks other than systemically important banks should
                  implement mentioned requirements proportionately.

                      The CAMELS review/GAR methodology directs examiners, inter alia, to review various
                      elements of banks’ annual reports and remuneration. As well, on-site examiners are to
                      analyze the banks’ policies about disclosure and through the GAR process.

EC3                   Laws, regulations or the supervisor require banks to disclose all material entities in the
                      group structure.

Description and       According to CCFS, banks are required to prepare consolidated financial statements and
findings re EC3       announce them in their web sites. The scope/exemptions of this consolidation are laid
                      down in article 5.

                      CPD article 4 (2) requires the disclosure of the information about the capital structure of
                      the parent bank and direct and indirect parties who influence the management or
                      supervision of the parent bank. Parent banks are required to disclose information on the
                      name/commercial title of the natural or legal persons holding their qualified shares and
                      information about the entities and the scope of consolidation. Banks are also required to
                      give information on related parties consistent with TAS 24.

EC4                   The supervisor or another government agency effectively reviews and enforces
                      compliance with disclosure standards.

Description and       As of December 2015, there are 52 banks in Turkey and 16 of them are publicly traded.
findings re EC4       These 16 banks’ disclosure standards are reviewed by Public Disclosure Platform which is a
                      governmental agency.

                      Furthermore, the Communiqué on Material Events Disclosure, 75 issued by the CMB, sets
                      forth the principles and procedures related to public disclosure of information, events and
                      development which may affect the value or price of securities or the investment decisions
                      of investors. These disclosures are submitted to the Public Disclosure Platform via Borsa
                      Istanbul, published in the web-site of the bank and kept in the web-site for 5 years.

                      BRSA regularly evaluates the timeliness and content of external audit/annual reports for
                      compliance with regulatory parameters. It is within this context that the BRSA would
                      review Pillar III disclosures.

EC5                   The supervisor or other relevant bodies regularly publishes information on the banking
                      system in aggregate to facilitate public understanding of the banking system and the
                      exercise of market discipline. Such information includes aggregate data on balance sheet

Principle 28

Comments               Banks are required to disclose their financial statements according to TFRS and TAS, the
                       Turkish version of IFRS and IAS, on both a solo basis and consolidated basis. Disclosure
                       requirements for nonfinancial information are adequate. BRSA regularly evaluates the
                       timeliness and content of external audit/annual reports for compliance with regulatory
                       parameters and Pillar III disclosures.

Principle 29           Abuse of financial services. The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies
                       and processes, including strict customer due diligence (CDD) rules to promote high ethical
                       and professional standards in the financial sector and prevent the bank from being used,
                       intentionally or unintentionally, for criminal activities. 77

Essential criteria

EC1                    Laws or regulations establish the duties, responsibilities and powers of the supervisor
                       related to the supervision of banks’ internal controls and enforcement of the relevant laws
                       and regulations regarding criminal activities.

Description and        The Turkish regime against money laundering is governed by the Law no. 5549 on
findings re EC1        Prevention of Laundering Proceeds of Crime (AML Law). The last revision of the act was
                       made in 2014. There is a separate Law no. 6415 on the Prevention of Financing of Terrorism
                       (TF Law) adopted on 16.02.2013. The money laundering offense is set forth in the Article
                       282 of the Turkish Criminal Law.

76   http://www.bddk.org.tr/WebSitesi/english/Statistical_Data/Statistical_Data.aspx
77 The Committee is aware that, in some jurisdictions, other authorities, such as a financial intelligence unit (FIU),

rather than a banking supervisor, may have primary responsibility for assessing compliance with laws and regulations
regarding criminal activities in banks, such as fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Thus, in the
context of this Principle, “the supervisor” might refer to such other authorities, in particular in Essential Criteria 7, 8
and 10. In such jurisdictions, the banking supervisor cooperates with such authorities to achieve adherence with the
criteria mentioned in this Principle.

Turkey has established a FIU called MASAK. The duties and powers of MASAK are
determined in the Article 19 of the AML Law and Article 16 of the TF Law.

MASAK is the main supervisory authority for AML/CFT related issues. Duties and powers of
MASAK include developing policies and implementation strategies, preparing legislation,
collecting and analyzing data, receiving suspicious transaction reports and deciding on and
coordinating inspections regarding AML/CFT issues.

The supervision of AML/CFT obligations is exercised by different sector supervisors from the
BRSA, Treasury and CMB on behalf of MASAK.

The role of the BRSA:

According to article 11 of the AML Law, on-site inspections are conducted by the MASAK
through different sector supervisors including the bank examiners and experts of the BRSA.
The BRSA serves as the “technical arm” of the MASAK for AML/CFT supervisory matters. The
MASAK examination teams are formed according to the MASAK requirements on a case by
case basis.

However, in addition to the inspections required by the MASAK, as a part of the on-site
supervision of banks, the BRSA oversee AML/CFT compliance in the banking industry. In
that context, the on-site teams examine and evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of
banks’ policies, procedures, work-flows, human resources management and internal control
systems in relation to the relevant regulations. The GAR Module of the BRSA has specific
questions on AML/CFT related issues.

In this context, AML/CFT policies, implementation procedures, human resources and control
systems are examined by the BRSA. These examinations are mostly done during the ratings
process assessing the following issues:

-        Whether the bank employs relevant number of personnel charged for AML/CFT
issues commensurate with its scale and operations and whether they are sufficiently
qualified, whether bank’s personnel is subject to an adequate level of training with respect
to AML/CFT issues and whether the frequency of training is commensurate with the scale
and operations of the bank,

-        Whether the bank uses an adequately structured IT framework with regard to
AML/CFT issues commensurate with the scale and operations of the bank,

-        Whether the criteria underlying the above mentioned IT framework are regularly
reviewed, and updated where it is deemed necessary,

-        Whether the authorization and responsibilities of the compliance officer is
documented and is adequate,

-        Whether the bank has a policy document regarding the AML/CFT issues approved
by the Board of Directors and whether this document is adequate,

-        Whether the bank has written criteria for detection of suspicious transactions,

                  -         Whether the bank has adequately established procedures regarding the
                  authorization of the relevant personnel for incorporating revisions to the IT framework
                  established for the detection of suspicious transactions,

                  -         Whether the bank has documented its CDD policies, including issues on
                  documents to be demanded from the customers and procedures for verification of the
                  accuracy of these documents,

                  -         Whether the internal controls with regard to the effectiveness and applicability of
                  cross controls are adequate,

                  -         Whether the internal audit unit of the bank has special audits on AML/CFT issues,

                  -         Whether the findings of the internal audit are followed up by the bank’s
                  management,

                  -         Whether the bank has an adequate internal assessment report about the AML/CFT
                  issues,

                  -         In the context of consolidated supervision, whether the parent company of the
                  bank has written policy documents on AML/CFT issues,

                  -         Whether the home country of the parent company is subject to the supervision of
                  an FIU.

                  These assessments are then incorporated into the CAMELS rating methodology under the
                  “Management” component.

                  Recently, the BRSA has established a Commission, composed of 4 senior bank examiners,
                  responsible for coordinating AML/CFT examinations. These examinations will be conducted
                  starting from the second half of 2016. For that purpose, the Commission prepared a
                  Supervisory Manual on AML/CFT Issues (SMAMLCFT) approved by the Chairman.

                  According to this manual on-site examiners are initially required to make an AML/CFT
                  related risk assessment of the bank. The manual includes analysis and assessments under 8
                  sections: Organizational Structure, Compliance, Training of the Personnel, Internal and
                  External Audit, Reporting Requirements, Process Audits, Retention of Documents, Secrecy.

EC2               The supervisor determines that banks have adequate policies and processes that promote
                  high ethical and professional standards and prevent the bank from being used, intentionally
                  or unintentionally, for criminal activities. This includes the prevention and detection of
                  criminal activity, and reporting of such suspected activities to the appropriate authorities.

Description and   The supervisory requirements on policies and processes to prevent institutions from being
findings re EC2   used for criminal activities are contained in the AML Law, TF Law and subsequent sub-
                  regulations, namely the Regulation on Measures Regarding Prevention of Laundering
                  proceeds of Crime and Financing of Terrorism (ROM), Regulation on Program of
                  Compliance with Obligations of Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
                  Terrorism (ROC) and Regulation on the Procedures and Principles Regarding the
                  Implementation of Law on the Prevention of Financing of Terrorism (ROT). Furthermore, the

                     MASAK prepared a formal supervision manual in 2010 called “Guidance on the Supervision
                     of Obligation”. This guidance involves check-lists for the obligors to provide examiners with
                     formal supervisory tools.

                     AML general compliance inspections aim at preventing and detecting criminal activities in
                     banks. As mentioned in EC1, the inspections are planned and coordinated by the MASAK
                     using banking experts of the BRSA. The inspections follow a risk-based approach focusing
                     on risk factors determined by the MASAK and relevant supervisory authorities. When
                     elaborating the annual supervisory plans, the MASAK coordinates with the supervisory
                     authorities the time frame and availability of human resources to AML/CFT supervision.

                     The examinations conducted in banks regarding AML/CFT issues by BRSA and MASAK
                     during the last two years are summarized in the following table:

                     The findings of these examinations are followed up by MASAK and shared with BRSA’s
                     management along with the other related information when requested.

                     Banks obligation to report suspicious activities related to money laundering or terrorist
                     financing activities are clearly established in article 4 of the AML Law and ROM, chapter 4.
                     The obligation is to report these activities to the MASAK only.

EC3                  In addition to reporting to the financial intelligence unit or other designated authorities,
                     banks report to the banking supervisor suspicious activities and incidents of fraud when
                     such activities/incidents are material to the safety, soundness or reputation of the bank. 78

Description and      Banks are required to report only to the MASAK any suspicious activities pursuant to the
findings re EC3      Article 4 of the AML Law.



78Consistent with international standards, banks are to report suspicious activities involving cases of potential money
laundering and the financing of terrorism to the relevant national centre, established either as an independent
governmental authority or within an existing authority or authorities that serves as an FIU.



                                                                                                                       215

EC4               If the supervisor becomes aware of any additional suspicious transactions, it informs the
                  financial intelligence unit and, if applicable, other designated authority of such transactions.
                  In addition, the supervisor, directly or indirectly, shares information related to suspected or
                  actual criminal activities with relevant authorities.

Description and   Pursuant to the Article 40 of the ROM, the BRSA informs the MASAK when it becomes
findings re EC4   aware of any suspicious transactions or criminal activity. The MASAK is responsible for
                  transmitting the information to judicial and other relevant authorities.

EC5               The supervisor determines that banks establish CDD policies and processes that are well
                  documented and communicated to all relevant staff. The supervisor also determines that
                  such policies and processes are integrated into the bank’s overall risk management and that
                  there are appropriate steps to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate risks of
                  money laundering and the financing of terrorism with respect to customers, countries and
                  regions, as well as to products, services, transactions and delivery channels on an ongoing
                  basis. The CDD management program, on a group-wide basis, has as its essential elements:

                  a)   a customer acceptance policy that identifies business relationships that the bank will
                       not accept based on identified risks;
                  b)   a customer identification, verification and due diligence programme on an ongoing
                       basis; this encompasses verification of beneficial ownership, understanding the purpose
                       and nature of the business relationship, and risk-based reviews to ensure that records
                       are updated and relevant;
                  c)   policies and processes to monitor and recognize unusual or potentially suspicious
                       transactions;
                  d)   enhanced due diligence on high-risk accounts (e.g., escalation to the bank’s senior
                       management level of decisions on entering into business relationships with these
                       accounts or maintaining such relationships when an existing relationship becomes
                       high-risk);
                  e)   enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons (including, among other things,
                       escalation to the bank’s senior management level of decisions on entering into
                       business relationships with these persons); and
                  f)   clear rules on what records must be kept on CDD and individual transactions and their
                       retention period. Such records have at least a five year retention period.
Description and   Supervisory determinations on CDD policies and processes are mostly defined in the ROM
findings re EC5   and the ROC. As mentioned in EC1, the BRSA examines CDD and AML/CFT polices and
                  process of banks under the management component of the ratings process. Regarding the
                  essential elements of the CDD management program:

                  a)   customer acceptance policy is not explicitly mentioned in the regulation;
                  b)   customer identification, verification and due diligence program, including beneficial
                       ownership are covered by the ROM, mostly on chapter 3.
                  c)   policies and processes to monitor and recognize unusual or potentially suspicious
                       transactions are covered by the RoM, chapter 4.

                  d)   escalation to the senior management level of decisions on entering into business
                       relationships with high-risk accounts is covered in articles 12 and 13 of the RoC.
                  e)   enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons is not defined in the regulation.
                       The BRSA and MASAK explained that since PEPs are involved in high risk groups, they
                       are indirectly subject to also the other obligations such as the obligation to pay special
                       attention to certain transactions, the obligations concerning new technologies or risky
                       countries (the Articles 18, 20 and 25 of the ROM, respectively).
                  f)   rules on what records must be kept on CDD are established by article 8 of the AML Law.
                       The obliged parties (including banks) should maintain the documents, books and
                       records for eight years from the last record date, and must keep identification
                       document for eight years from the last transaction date.

EC6               The supervisor determines that banks have in addition to normal due diligence, specific
                  policies and processes regarding correspondent banking. Such policies and processes
                  include:

                  a)   gathering sufficient information about their respondent banks to understand fully the
                       nature of their business and customer base, and how they are supervised; and
                  b) not establishing or continuing correspondent relationships with those that do not have
                       adequate controls against criminal activities or that are not effectively supervised by the
                       relevant authorities, or with those banks that are considered to be shell banks.

Description and   Article 23 of the ROM provides the measures to be taken by financial institutions with
findings re EC6   regard to correspondent banking and payable-through accounts. Financial institutions are
                  obliged to apply enhanced due diligence measures in their correspondent banking
                  relationships and assess the AML and terrorist financing system of the respondent financial
                  institution.

                  More specifically, article 23 of the ROM states that financial institutions are required to take
                  necessary measures in foreign correspondent relationships in order to obtain, by making
                  use of publicly available resources, reliable information on whether the respondent financial
                  institution has been subject to a money laundering and terrorist financing investigation and
                  been punished, its business field, reputation and the adequacy of supervision on it. Banks
                  are also required to assess AML and terrorist financing system of the respondent financial
                  institution and to ascertain that the system is appropriate and effective. Financial
                  institutions must also obtain approval from a senior manager before establishing new
                  correspondent relationships.

                  According to Article 23 of the ROM, it is forbidden for financial institutions to establish
                  correspondent relationship with shell banks and financial institutions about which they
                  cannot be sure that these institutions do not permit their accounts to be used by shell
                  banks.

EC7               The supervisor determines that banks have sufficient controls and systems to prevent,
                  identify and report potential abuses of financial services, including money laundering and
                  the financing of terrorism.

Description and   In addition to broad regulation on internal controls issued by the BRSA, including IRCAAP,
findings re EC7   the ROM requires financial institutions to establish appropriate risk management systems to
                  follow up permanently the transactions made by their customers and analyze the
                  compatibility of these transactions with the profile of the customer in order to identify and
                  report potential suspicious transactions. Furthermore, ROC, chapter 7, establishes
                  requirements for internal controls related to AML/CFT.

                  The BRSA assesses on a regular basis, as part of the ratings process, whether banks internal
                  systems and controls are appropriately addressing AML/CFT issues. These inspections
                  include, but are not limited to the adequacy of the IT framework, internal controls and
                  bank’s policy and internal audit function in relation to AML/CFT. Furthermore, MASAK
                  coordinates compliance inspections with AML/CFT regulation. Please refer to EC1.

EC8               The supervisor has adequate powers to take action against a bank that does not comply
                  with its obligations related to relevant laws and regulations regarding criminal activities.

Description and   The MASAK is the only authority empowered to sanction financial institutions in case of
findings re EC8   non-compliance with the AML/CFT requirements.

                  Articles 13 and 14 of the AML Law specify the administrative fines and judicial penalties in
                  failure to comply with obligations prescribed in the law. Furthermore, the Article 39(2) of
                  the ROM, extends the administrative fines applicable for failure to comply with the CDD and
                  suspicious transaction reporting obligations. Administrative fines are imposed by the
                  MASAK.

                  The Article 14 of the TF Law stipulates that MASAK will monitor the compliance of
                  institutions and persons holding assets with the freezing measures and the Article 15 of the
                  TF Law sets out the penal sanctions applicable for failure to comply with freezing decisions.

                  The MASAK is also authorized to take any violation of Articles 4(2), 7 and 8 of the AML Law
                  to the public prosecutor in order to allow the violating bank to be subjected to judicial
                  penalty. (Article 4(2) is on disclosing the information in the suspicious transaction reports.
                  Article 7 is on providing all kinds of information requested by MASAK. Article 8 is on the
                  obligation of obliged parties to retain the documents, books and records for eight years.)

                  Although the powers of BRSA set out under the BL are not directly related to money
                  laundering or terrorist financing crimes, the BRSA is authorized by law to implement
                  administrative penalties to a bank that does not comply with its duties. The BRSA is also
                  empowered to take any criminal activity by a bank to the public prosecutor. Among those
                  criminal activities are failure to submit data and documents, failure to comply with the
                  obligation of records keeping, false statement, non-recording transactions, non-factual
                  accounting and embezzlement.

EC9                 The supervisor determines that banks have:

                    a)   requirements for internal audit and/or external experts 79 to independently evaluate the
                         relevant risk management policies, processes and controls. The supervisor has access to
                         their reports;
                    b)   established policies and processes to designate compliance officers at the banks’
                         management level, and appoint a relevant dedicated officer to whom potential abuses
                         of the banks’ financial services (including suspicious transactions) are reported;
                    c)   adequate screening policies and processes to ensure high ethical and professional
                         standards when hiring staff; or when entering into an agency or outsourcing
                         relationship; and
                    d)   ongoing training programs for their staff, including on CDD and methods to monitor
                         and detect criminal and suspicious activities.

Description and     a)   The requirements for internal audit are established in the RICAAP and are assessed by

                         audit.
                    b)   Requirements for establishing compliance programs are prescribed in the ROC. The
                         regulation includes requirements regarding the adoption of policies and procedures,
                         the establishment of monitoring processes and controls and the appointment of a
                         compliance officer to whom potential abuses of the bank’s financial services are
                         reported.
                    c)   MASAK regulation includes provisions to ensure high ethical and professional
                         standards when hiring staff but those measures only address the screening of senior
                         management.
                    d) Chapter 6 of the ROC includes provisions on the training of the staff on AML/CFT
                         matters.

EC10                The supervisor determines that banks have and follow clear policies and processes for staff
                    to report any problems related to the abuse of the banks’ financial services to either local
                    management or the relevant dedicated officer or to both. The supervisor also determines
                    that banks have and utilize adequate management information systems to provide the
                    banks’ Boards, management and the dedicated officers with timely and appropriate
                    information on such activities.

Description and     MASAK (ROM) requires banks to report suspicious transactions (STR) via their compliance
findings re EC10    officers. The ROC, particularly chapter two, requires the establishment of institutional
                    policies and procedures related to STR. Chapter 7 provides guidance on the internal
                    controls.

                    Obliged parties send their institutional policies to MASAK that evaluate their adequacy.
                    Additionally, articles 24 and 28 of the ROC requires the obligors to report detailed

subject to appropriate confidentiality restrictions.



                                                                                                                219

                   information on staff training and the works carried out in the scope of internal control
                   activities.

                   General compliance inspections are carried out by the BRSA on behalf of MASAK. Please
                   also refer to EC2.

EC11               Laws provide that a member of a bank’s staff who reports suspicious activity in good faith
                   either internally or directly to the relevant authority cannot be held liable.

Description and    A member of a bank’s staff who reports suspicious activity in good faith will be protected
findings re EC11   under article 10 of the AML Law. According to this article, natural and legal persons fulfilling
                   their obligations in accordance with this Law will not be subject to civil and criminal liability.

EC12               The supervisor, directly or indirectly, cooperates with the relevant domestic and foreign
                   financial sector supervisory authorities or shares with them information related to suspected
                   or actual criminal activities where this information is for supervisory purposes.

Description and    MASAK is authorized to exchange views and information on the subjects within the scope
findings re EC12   of its duties. In that manner, MASAK may exchange information and documents with
                   foreign counterparts and sign MoU (art. 12 of the AML law) establishing the basis for
                   cooperation.

                   MASAK has been a member of the Egmont Group of FIUs since 1998. As member, MASAK is
                   able to exchange information related to money laundering, and predicate offenses resulting
                   in money laundering, with other members of the Egmont Group using the Egmont Secure
                   Web and in accordance with the “Statements of Purpose of the Egmont Group and its
                   Principles for Information Exchange.

                   The BRSA is also authorized by Article 98 of the BL to cooperate and exchange information
                   regarding financial institutions and financial markets with any counterpart supervisory
                   authority. Please refer to CP13.

                   MASAK and BRSA have signed a protocol on information exchange and working
                   arrangements. Please also refer to EC2.

EC13               Unless done by another authority, the supervisor has in-house resources with specialist
                   expertise for addressing criminal activities. In this case, the supervisor regularly provides
                   information on risks of money laundering and the financing of terrorism to the banks.

Description and    As explained in EC1, the MASAK is the main supervisory authority for AML/CFT related
findings re EC13   issues pursuant to the Articles 11 and 9(1) (i) of the AML Law. Duties and powers of the
                   MASAK include developing policies and implementation strategies, preparing legislation,
                   collecting and analyzing data, receiving suspicious transaction reports and coordinating
                   inspections on AML/CFT issues.

                   The MASAK conducts training activities for the obligors as well as the relevant regulatory
                   and supervisory authorities. Within this framework, the MASAK conducted 6 workshops in
                   2014 with 64 participants from the Tax Inspection Board, Customs and Trade Ministry
                   Inspection Board, BRSA, Comptrollers Board of the Treasury, Insurance Supervision Board of

                the Treasury and Capital Markets Board. Additionally, 5 workshops were conducted with
                490 participants from the obligors including banks, insurance and pensions corporations
                and Islamic banks.

                The BRSA also maintains a team of experts on AML/CFT issues in charge of inspections,
                drafting manuals and disseminate the expertise.

                Finally, the MASAK provides information on risks of money laundering and the financing of
                terrorism to the banks in the form of handbooks, workshops and frequent contacts and
                discussions.

Assessment of   Largely Compliant
Principle 29

Comments        The scope of the assessment of this principle was limited to the applicable regulation and
                the BRSA activities. It did not include MASAK coordinated inspections and other activities.

                The AML law and related regulations forms the framework to prevent the abuse of financial
                services. The framework includes customer due diligence (CDD) rules and procedures to
                report suspicious transactions but have shortcomings that need to be addressed. In
                particular, the CDD requirements should include a customer acceptance policy that
                identifies business relationships that the bank will not accepted based on identified risks
                and enhanced due diligence on politically exposed persons. The framework should also
                require banks to report to the BRSA suspicious activities and incidents of fraud when such
                activities/incidents are material to the safety and soundness or reputation of the bank.

SUMMARY COMPLIANCE WITH THE BASEL CORE
PRINCIPLES
 Core Principle                     Grade   Comments
 1. Responsibilities, objectives    LC      The BL provides a broadly appropriate framework for
 and powers                                 regulating and supervising banks. It also provides clear
                                            responsibilities and adequate powers to the BRSA.
                                            However, the lack of appropriately defined hierarchy
                                            among the objectives of financial stability and
                                            development of the financial sector may cause potential
                                            conflicts and be harmful to the safety and soundness of
                                            banks. The assessors noted that some BRSA decisions (e.g.,
                                            differentiations in loan loss provisions and loan
                                            restructuring rules) might be interpreted as rules that aim
                                            primarily to support financial development objectives. Such
                                            measures might affect the reputation of the supervisors
                                            and convey the message of forbearance. In order to be
                                            fully compliant with this principle the objective of
                                            development of the financial sector should be explicitly
                                            subordinated to financial stability in the BL

 2. Independence, accountability,   MNC     The legal protection of the supervisor is broadly adequate.
 resourcing and legal protection            Nonetheless the institutional framework contains
 for supervisors                            shortcomings that should be improved.

                                            The BL establishes the BRSA as an independent body but
                                            it contains provisions that might undermine
                                            independence in practice. There are several channels of
                                            interaction between the BRSA and the government that,
                                            considered together, may accommodate political
                                            influence: i) the appointments of the Chair and Board
                                            members are made by the Council of Ministers without
                                            any confirmation process by any other independent body;
                                            ii) before putting into force regulatory procedures the BRSA
                                            needs, by law, to consult the related Ministry; iii) the Prime
                                            Minister approves the removal of members of the Board,
                                            if conditions specified in the BL are met, without
                                            publishing the reasons; iv) the relevant minister may
                                            permit lawsuit against board members; and v) the BL
                                            allows the relevant ministry to file a lawsuit for the
                                            cancelation of the Boards regulatory decisions (art. 105).
                                            These possible channels of political influence over the
                                            Agency, particularly considering the large role played by

                                           state-owned banks in Turkey, might cause conflicts of
                                           interest that might undermine financial stability.

                                           The authorities should therefore amend the legislation to
                                           limit the cases that require the Minister’s involvement. In
                                           particular, it seems appropriate to establish a third party
                                           to perform a stronger role in the checks and balances
                                           framework such as, making regulatory consultation
                                           procedures more transparent, so that BRSA proposals and
                                           Ministry comments are published, introducing a process
                                           for appointments for the BRSA to be confirmed by a non-
                                           executive government body and removing the related
                                           minister permission for lawsuits for the cancelation of the
                                           BRSB regulatory decisions.

                                           There also seems to be room for improving the
                                           accountability framework. Despite the periodic briefings
                                           from the BRSA to the Council of Ministers, the assessors
                                           did not see evidence of a third party aiming to ensure that
                                           the powers delegated to the BRSA are exercised
                                           appropriately and that its operations are effective and in
                                           line with its mandate and objectives.

                                           Finally, in relation to resourcing, entry conditions to the
                                           BRSA are not attractive for the hiring of mid-career
                                           professionals and provide practical constraints in the
                                           event of a shortfall in experience levels.

3. Cooperation and collaboration   C       Legal provisions as well as operational frameworks for
                                           cooperation and collaboration with domestic and foreign
                                           authorities are in place. Protections on confidentiality
                                           appear appropriate. Regarding the lack of processes for
                                           recovery and resolution planning, the assessors do not
                                           see their absence as reflecting a lack of collaboration
                                           between authorities. See also CP9.

4. Permissible activities          C       The BL provides clear definitions of activities that are only
                                           permitted to be conducted by registered banks, including
                                           taking deposits from the public.

5. Licensing criteria              LC      Provisions in the laws and regulations related to licensing
                                           and the process followed by the BRSA provide a
                                           comprehensive framework to assess the adequacy of new
                                           registrations for banks, including foreign bank branches.
                                           The BRSA seems to have a broadly sound process to



                                                                                                         223

                                      assess applications in practice. However, in order to
                                      maintain a licensing process fully compliant with the
                                      principle, the BRSA needs to additionally: i) impose
                                      requirements and assess if the bank’s board has a
                                      collectively sound knowledge of the material activities the
                                      bank intends to pursue; and ii) for cross-border banking
                                      operations, determine whether the home supervisor
                                      practices global consolidated supervision.

 6. Transfer of significant   C       The power given to the supervisor by laws and regulations
 ownership                            as well as the current procedures provide broadly sound
                                      control and oversight regarding significant ownership of a
                                      bank and a controlling company.

 7. Major acquisitions        C       The regulatory framework subjects major acquisitions and
                                      investments by banks and controlling companies to prior
                                      approval by the BRSA. The BRSA also has well established
                                      supervisory practices to limit and monitor risks arising
                                      from such activities. Going forward, supervisors should
                                      consider more extensively and formally the effectiveness
                                      of supervision in host countries.

 8. Supervisory approach      MNC     •   The BRSA has an established and comprehensive
                                          methodology to supervise banks. This methodology is
                                          documented in a number of manuals and leverages
                                          comprehensive databases and a broadly appropriate
                                          regulatory framework. Nevertheless, the practical
                                          implementation of the process is subject to
                                          shortcomings that needs to be addressed:

                                      •   The inspections need to develop a more profound
                                          and forward-looking risk assessment nature,
                                          producing a clear view of the risks faced by and
                                          posed by the bank. Current conclusions tend to focus
                                          mostly on compliance issues and do not identify and
                                          make clear if there is need for broader and more
                                          forceful supervisory action. Supervisors also need to
                                          derive and highlight the implications of the specific
                                          findings for the broader risk assessment of the bank.

                                      •   The BRSA should not take excessive comfort from the
                                          fact that issues are analyzed during the ratings
                                          process. By its own nature, and as currently applied
                                          by the BRSA, the ratings process is not deep enough

                                            to generate firm and actionable conclusions. From
                                            time to time, the scope of special inspections needs
                                            to encompass issues that are currently addressed only
                                            during the ratings phase.

                                        •   The BRSA needs to enhance the forward-looking
                                            components of its assessments. Results of the ICAAP
                                            need to be more thoroughly analyzed and discussed
                                            with banks. Stress tests results should play a larger
                                            role in the assessment framework. In addition, the
                                            ratings methodology could explicitly incorporate the
                                            expected trend for each component.

                                        •   Banks, particularly the systemically important ones,
                                            should be required to develop recovery plans and the
                                            BRSA should assess their resolvability.

                                        •   The assessors understand that the BRSA is already
                                            developing actions to address some of the above
                                            issues and encourage the authorities to keep working
                                            to improve the efficiency of the process.

9. Supervisory techniques and   LC      The BRSA employs an array of tools and techniques to
tools                                   carry out its supervisory responsibilities. On-site and off-
                                        site functions are relevant and well developed. The
                                        different departments also share their findings with each
                                        other, but their work seems to be conducted in parallel
                                        with little coordination. The departments do not seem to
                                        have joint projects and supervisors do not exchange views
                                        beyond written reports. As required by EC1, it is important
                                        for the BRSA to develop policies and processes to assess
                                        the effectiveness and integration of on-site and off-site
                                        functions, and to address any weaknesses that are
                                        identified. Increasing the rotation between on- and off-
                                        site supervisors could also help the integration of the
                                        areas.

                                        Communication with banks could also be improved. The
                                        BRSA should consider setting policies establishing at least
                                        one annual meeting between supervisors and the board
                                        of the bank. The end of the CAMELS rating process, when
                                        the supervisor summarizes its opinion of the bank, might
                                        be an appropriate occasion to explain to the board the
                                        views and concerns of the BRSA. The assessors

                                          understand that this is frequently done, but not
                                          systematically with all banks. Additionally, other important
                                          analyses done by the BRSA, such as the stress testing
                                          exercises could also be more clearly discussed with banks.

 10. Supervisory reporting        C       The regulatory framework requires banks and controlling
                                          companies to periodically submit a broad range of
                                          information. Regulatory and supervisory processes exist to
                                          ensure accuracy and comparability of submitted returns.
                                          Developed procedures for analyzing collected information
                                          and feeding into supervisory activities are in place.

                                          Going forward the BRSA could consider formalizing the
                                          process of periodically review of the information
                                          collected, to determine that it remains appropriate and
                                          satisfies its needs.

 11. Corrective and sanctioning   LC      The BRSA has available an appropriate range of
 powers of supervisors                    supervisory tools to use when, in the supervisor’s
                                          judgment, a bank is not complying with the regulations or
                                          represents a risk for the financial sector. Nevertheless, in
                                          practice, the remedial and corrective actions provided for
                                          in the law are rarely used at an early stage as a
                                          preventative measure. The BRSA seems to rely more
                                          heavily on administrative fines whose scope of application
                                          is more clearly defined in the BL than on taking actionsat
                                          an early stage to address unsafe and unsound practices
                                          that require supervisory judgment.

                                          The assessors were presented evidence of BRSA actions
                                          requiring banks to make adjustments to practices and
                                          processes. Nevertheless, such action had a scope limited
                                          to specific issues such as the classification of particular
                                          loan operations. Evidence was not observed of supervisors
                                          addressing broader concerns about the risks posed and
                                          faced by banks from a deepening and expansion of the
                                          initial review, a point reinforced in the comments of
                                          banks.

                                          The supervisory review process within the BRSA also
                                          seems to play a role towards limiting the issues that
                                          supervisors raise with banks. Although reviews of
                                          supervisory reports are necessary, the current process
                                          seems relatively skewed towards validation of compliance

                                       processes and thus constrains active supervisory
                                       judgments and decisions. Consideration could also be
                                       given to integration of supervision and enforcement,
                                       particularly in terms of communication with financial
                                       institutions, which might support a more risk focused and
                                       less compliance based supervisory approach.

                                       In order to become fully compliant with this principle the
                                       BRSA needs to incorporate the results of forward looking
                                       tools more heavily in its decision making process and act
                                       at an early stage to restore weak banks and correct
                                       examples of unsound practices, even if formal prudential
                                       ratios haven’t been breached.

12. Consolidated supervision   LC      The regulatory and reporting framework provides a
                                       broadly appropriate structure for monitoring and
                                       assessing risks to banks from non-banking and foreign
                                       banking operations in banking groups. However, the
                                       current limitations of the CAMELS rating and ICAAP
                                       process, the BRSA should make further effort to monitor
                                       and manage risks arising from nonbanking and foreign
                                       activities or parent entities of a financial group. In this
                                       regard, as described in CP 8 and 9, the BRSA should
                                       deepen the analyses and strengthen its techniques, such
                                       as group-wide stress testing, to monitor and assess these
                                       risks. It is important to further improve the group-wide
                                       strategic view of the banking group operations and risks.
                                       Authorities should further improve the recovery and
                                       resolution planning of large banking groups particularly
                                       once the necessary power is given to the supervisor by
                                       the expected new legislation. Such planning should also
                                       consider scenarios where shocks originate from non-
                                       banking entities or parent groups. Taking into account
                                       that these shortcomings have already been reflected in
                                       other principles, particularly CP 8 and 9, the assessors
                                       considered this principle compliant.

13. Home-host relationships    LC      The BRSA has made vast efforts to improve home-host
                                       relationship during the last few years. Among several
                                       initiatives the agency has started organizing colleges,
                                       signed a number of important MoUs and removed
                                       obstacles that weakened the supervision of Turkish banks’
                                       operations in several countries. Nevertheless, considering

                                    that some Turkish banks hold material operations abroad,
                                    it is important to improve the relationship even further. In
                                    particular, it is essential to develop a framework for cross-

                                    and the development of resolution plans that pay special
                                    attention to cross border issues.

 14. Corporate governance   MNC     The legal framework surrounding the corporate
                                    governance framework for banks is extensive, but very
                                    heavily focused on board responsibilities regarding
                                    internal systems (risk management, internal control,
                                    internal audit). Examination processes (GAR and
                                    specialized examinations) have required steps to check
                                    board approvals, internal structures, and processes which
                                    reflect on the governance function. The BRSA approves
                                    board and senior management appointments. In this way,
                                    the BRSA reviews the appointments process of the bank.

                                    However, the results of special examinations and
                                    supervisory processes consistently stop short of drawing
                                    conclusions, in analytical, narrative form, on the
                                    implications the findings have for critical areas that are
                                    directly linked to the examined area. These critical areas
                                    reflect directly on the corporate governance effectiveness
                                    of the bank (such as management oversight of business
                                    areas, adequacy of risk management and internal audit’s
                                    role in the subject areas, integrity of MIS that goes up to
                                    the board level, and ultimately, board oversight). As a
                                    result, supervisory observations are not easily collected in
                                    order to form a more cross-cutting, substantiated view on
                                    corporate governance and the adequacy of internal
                                    systems. Therefore, validation of the manner in which such
                                    internal systems and governance operates is not well
                                    supported. This impacts the degree to which the BRSA
                                    should place confidence in the systems that inform the
                                    board and itself, as well as the systems’ ability to generate
                                    early warning indicators of deterioration.

                                    There is no requirement for the majority of the board to
                                    be composed of non-executive members which could
                                    result in, potentially, boards being composed of a majority
                                    of executive directors with only the 2 nonexecutives as
                                    currently required by the legal framework. However,

Core Principle   Grade   Comments
                         practically speaking, 10 out of 53 banks are listed and
                         must fall under the CMB Communique on governance
                         which requires a majority of independent directors.
                         Consideration should be given to upgrading legislation
                         requiring the board to be composed of a majority of
                         nonexecutive members, and ideally, with a certain
                         minimum of independent individuals. (The definition of
                         “independent” should be consistent with that used by the
                         CMB in its Communiqué on Corporate Governance.)

                         Audit committee membership should be expanded. While
                         some bank boards in the system have populated this
                         committee with more members, a minimum of 2 members
                         is considered too few in order to execute the duties
                         assigned to it in a robust and effective manner. This is
                         particularly so since the audit committee is considered an
                         extension of the board and is assigned the task of internal
                         systems oversight which includes risk management. In
                         addition, the chair of this committee, in some banks, is
                         also the chairman of the board which does not reflect best
                         practice and potentially represents a conflict of interest.
                         This committee should be expanded and should be
                         composed of all independent directors. As well, legislation
                         directs that audit committees have oversight responsibility
                         for internal systems which includes risk management.
                         Under the current audit committee structures, proper
                         oversight of both critical areas is difficult at best. Risk
                         management oversight responsibility should be separated
                         from the audit committee, particularly in the more
                         complex institutions (it was noted that one bank, in fact,
                         constituted a separate risk management committee).

                         While three special examinations of governance elements
                         have been conducted, there is a need to more regularly
                         conduct cross-cutting assessments of corporate
                         governance in a holistic manner which would, in part,
                         leverage recent examination results and relevant offsite
                         information as well as information generated from any
                         enforcement actions. Consideration could be given to
                         introducing such a review in order to enhance and better
                         substantiate conclusions on the adequacy of a bank’s
                         corporate governance.

                                       Given the observations cited in the above ECs (board
                                       membership/objectivity, board nominations process,
                                       board committee structure and membership,
                                       management oversight and performance evaluation,

                                       internal code of conduct, etc.) the BRSA should develop a
                                       more comprehensive corporate governance regulation
                                       that completes the elements of governance that already
                                       exist in guidelines and regulation. This type of instrument
                                       could be a focal point of supervisory corporate
                                       governance reviews in the future.

 15. Risk management process   LC      The RICAAP forms a part of the core of the BRSA’s
                                       regulatory framework for risk management. Given that the
                                       ICAAP is a relatively recent requirement, banks’ are still
                                       developing their approach and implementing important
                                       systems. The BCP team’s review of supervisors’ working
                                       papers and discussion with banks indicated that banks as
                                       well as supervisors are, in fact, in a learning phase. The
                                       quality of banks reports and the scrutiny of the reports by
                                       supervisors will need to develop further before the results
                                       can be more reliably and more extensively used.

                                       Commensurate with their size and complexity of
                                       operations, banks should be specifically required to have
                                       qualified CROs with sufficient stature, position and
                                       authority within the organization to oversee risk
                                       management activities. The level of senior manager may
                                       not provide the necessary stature necessary to challenge
                                       high level risk decisions and processes.

                                       As well, while there are comprehensive requirements for
                                       the evaluation of new products, parameters should be
                                       expanded to explicitly address material modifications to
                                       existing products and major acquisitions. It should also
                                       direct banks to restrict such products or activities if they
                                       do not have the necessary controls, management, and
                                       resources to manage related risks.

 16. Capital adequacy          C       The BRSA has adopted the various components of Basel II,
                                       2.5 and III according to the framework established by the
                                       Basel Committee. Capital is calculated on a consolidated
                                       and solo basis for all banks and the BRSA has the
                                       authority to impose additional capital requirements on

Core Principle    Grade   Comments
                          individual banks, as deemed necessary. The BRSA has
                          applied the three Basel ratios (common equity tier 1, tier 1
                          and total capital) as well as countercyclical capital
                          requirements, systemically important bank capital add-
                          ons and a “capital planning buffer” that provides a
                          forward looking nature to the capital regulation.

                          Going forward, as the BRSA gain experience with the
                          ICAAP, it should consider simplifications to the framework
                          to improve its enforceability and reduce banks’
                          compliance burden, particularly for non-systemically
                          important banks. Simplifications that could be considered
                          include restrictions on diversification benefits and use of
                          models for credit, market and operational risk that have
                          not been authorized for the Pillar 1 capital charge. The
                          BRSA should also evaluate the interaction with other
                          requirements such as the 12% parallel capital charge and
                          the Basel capital buffers to prevent the effectiveness of
                          the Pillar 2 regime from being damaged by another more
                          stringent requirement that in practice makes the Pillar 2
                          charges irrelevant.

17. Credit risk   MNC     The legal framework for credit risk is generally
                          comprehensive. It establishes the responsibility of the
                          board in this area, requires a framework for the credit
                          business of banks, as well as prescribes a properly
                          controlled credit risk environment. However, several issues
                          exist which compromise the effectiveness the framework
                          and its application.

                          As prescribed in regulation and organized in practice
                          (verified through review of credit portfolio special
                          examinations presented by the BRSA during the
                          assessment) the credit risk management oversight (line
                          management function) and credit risk management
                          function and the organization therein create loopholes in
                          independence and integrity of credit risk monitoring and
                          reporting to bank boards and the BRSA:

                          1.       The framework design does not require ongoing,
                          independent (from the business line) credit risk
                          monitoring of large individual exposures or homogeneous
                          portfolios. Important source data (e.g., identification of

                          management function (credit monitoring) without
                          independent verification that 1) management
                          identification processes are accurate and timely, 2) that
                          management, itself, is well informed of the risk and that it
                          is running and is upholding board prescribed
                          underwriting standards, and therefore, accurately
                          conveying its business risk, and that 3) timely borrower

                          functions for audit committee and board reporting and is
                          also likely the information also reported to the BRSA for
                          monitoring and examination purposes.

                          Although the internal audit function plays an important
                          role in ensuring a strong control environment, the
                          function itself is not designed to play an ongoing
                          surveillance role such as the independent credit risk
                          management unit. It cannot replace the need to have such
                          a function within the bank(s).

                          Highlighting the issues surrounding this organizational
                          environment, examiners, through their inspection process,
                          have identified important, clearly inaccurate classifications
                          of credit that could easily indicate the existence of 1 and 2
                          above. However, the significance of these inaccurate
                          classifications was not clear from the examination samples
                          reviewed. Consistently, there was no indication of the size
                          of the sample of reviewed credits, how significant the
                          aggregate, inaccurately classified credit was to the total
                          portfolio, and if such findings could be extrapolated to
                          the entire portfolio.

                          Credit classification definitions, particularly in the special
                          mention and substandard categories are overlapping.
                          Evidence demonstrates that both the examiners, but
                          especially the bankers, fluidly move credits among these
                          categories which compromises the picture of the bank’s
                          risk profile which accurate classification is intended to
                          depict. As well, such movement and less rigorous

                                          classification impacts provisioning levels and ultimately,
                                          the accuracy of the bank’s financial statement.

                                          The REPL explicitly allows restructuring of loss credit
                                          which is considering in many systems to be imprudent
                                          activity as such loans are, by definition, permanently
                                          impaired and considered “nonbankable” assets. In some
                                          systems, such credits are prohibited from being
                                          restructured. The draft REPL is silent on this issue but
                                          theoretically would allow this practice. This practice
                                          should be explicitly addressed (disallowed).

                                          The manner in which the examiners present and write up
                                          the credits that they review during the special
                                          examination does not clearly depict the nature and
                                          volume of other related exposures (in the given bank)
                                          which, if presented, would help put the overall borrower
                                          relationship in context.

18. Problem assets, provisions,   MNC     The framework for credit classification and provisioning is
and reserves                              generally adequate. However, the accuracy of asset
                                          classification by banks, and therefore the integrity of
                                          reporting to boards and the BRSA is called into question
                                          given the nature of reclassifications assigned by onsite
                                          examiners and the lack of documentation therein. Loan
                                          write ups require more support and context as well as
                                          need to present nature of collateral and provision impact.
                                          Examination conclusions focus more on internal control
                                          issues rather than higher level implications for the
                                          condition and management of the credit portfolio under
                                          examination.

                                          Given the lack of (documented) focus on the implications
                                          of important bank processes, the examination exercise
                                          missed the opportunity to identify very important linkages
                                          with and conclusions on:

                                          •   Management’s understanding of their business and
                                              credit risk, ability to identify deterioration proactively
                                              – thereby allowing for early intervention.

                                          •   Implications for internal systems => function, role,
                                              and independence of credit risk management –
                                              thereby validating the systems that the bank’s board

                                                oversee the institution. As well, these systems are key
                                                to the exercise of risk based supervision by the BRSA.

                                                the BRSA

                                            The historical and statistical support for standard (general)
                                            and special mention loan categories is not substantiated
                                            by accumulated loss experience. It is not clear if appraised
                                            values, within a range, are being realized upon the sale of
                                            the properties or if provisioned amounts are adequately
                                            covering loss experience on classified loans. Clear
                                            parameters should be established for periodic valuation of
                                            underlying collateral on NPL exposures.

 19. Concentration risk and large   C       The legal framework addressing concentration risk and
 exposure limits                            large exposures limits is generally in line with international
                                            standards. The definition of connected parties is
                                            comprehensive. The BRSA examines and monitors various
                                            exposures including, inter alia, large exposures,
                                            concentrations by sector, product, customer, and risk
                                            group.

 20. Transactions with related      LC      The legal and regulatory framework for related parties is
 parties                                    comprehensive. The offsite department receives and
                                            regularly monitors reporting from banks. The onsite
                                            review process for related parties is well structured;
                                            related party exposures and the controls and board
                                            processes therein are reviewed during the onsite
                                            processes.

                                            However, there is no explicit provision that requires prior
                                            approval of related party transactions by the bank’s
                                            board. As well, no explicit provision requires approval
                                            (prior or post) of write-off of related party transactions.

                                            While Article 48 of the BL provides a comprehensive
                                            definition of “loan” and related party limitations address
                                            such, legislation does not include other non-crediting
                                            transactions within the limitations addressing related
                                            parties. Legislation should be expanded to explicitly
                                            capture all transactions, including loans, within the
                                            parameters of related party limits and requirements.

Core Principle                   Grade   Comments
                                         The assessment team was informed that a draft revision of
                                         the BL is being prepared by the BRSA. Within this context,
                                         article 50 (a and b) may be revoked to allow board
                                         member borrowing from the bank. It will also address
                                         related party “transactions” as well. The assessment team
                                         cautions the BRSA on relaxing related party risk
                                         parameters. There are countries that continue to
                                         rigorously restrict extension of credit, as well as
                                         transactions with, related parties of the bank, including
                                         board members. This is an area which historically has
                                         proven consistently problematic in distressed bank
                                         situations. Therefore, the team advises caution in
                                         widening the scope for such exposures.

21. Country and transfer risks   C       BRSA guidance adequately captures country and transfer
                                         risk as well as other relevant risks. Banks are expected to
                                         establish country risk parameters as well as systems for
                                         monitoring exposures, including indirect foreign-
                                         exchange risk and indirect country risk. Country risk is
                                         evaluated through the CAMELS review process and via the
                                         risk matrix of the bank.

22. Market risk                  C       The BRSA has adopted comprehensive regulation and
                                         guidance through which to direct banks to identify,
                                         measure, and monitor their market risk exposures. This
                                         includes parameters for valuation, stress testing, and
                                         model use. For examination purposes, these elements are
                                         largely addressed through the CAMELS rating/GAR
                                         methodology review process, and on an overall basis,
                                         during the ICAAP review.

                                         Of note, currently, specialist expertise is not deployed to
                                         evaluate the scenarios or calculation details of the stress
                                         testing exercises. Examiners review the models used to
                                         measure market risk. However, they also depend
                                         substantially on the banks’ model validation process. To
                                         deepen the work and enhance the forward looking aspect,
                                         the BRSA could consider deploying trained specialists to
                                         assess stress test approaches and mathematical integrity
                                         and to leverage resulting advice/input on specialized
                                         exams. As well, enhanced examiner expertise in the area
                                         of model evaluation could provide added assurance to
                                         the BRSA on the integrity of bank models used.

 23. Interest rate risk in the   C       BRSA supervision of interest rate risk is addressed through
 banking book                            several activities. It is reviewed as a part of the overall
                                         ICAAP review process and captured as an input in the
                                         stress testing conducted therein. As well, the supervisor
                                         covers elements of interest rate risk through the GAR
                                         process, as described in EC 1 above, which is conducted
                                         onsite but not to the depth of what a special examination
                                         would require. However, specialized examinations of this
                                         area are not yet conducted.

                                         The BRSA should develop specialized examination
                                         procedures for interest rate risk where it identifies
                                         increasing or high risk areas. The BRSA should use
                                         specialized expertise with which to evaluate scenarios and
                                         assumptions used for more complex stress testing as well
                                         as to review model validations during onsite examinations
                                         or, as an offsite exercise.

 24. Liquidity risk              C       The BRSA has set up a comprehensive framework for

                                         responsibilities. Regulation is in some cases more rigorous
                                         than international benchmarks. A wide range of tools is in
                                         place for monitoring banks’ liquidity positions and
                                         funding experience. The CAMELS review/GAR
                                         methodology addresses liquidity, and specialized
                                         examinations are conducted when a change in trends or
                                         strategy is detected. As well, the BRSA underwent a
                                         Regulatory Consistency Assessment of its Basel III LCR
                                         regulations for which it received a “compliant” rating.

                                         However, review of onsite documents indicated that
                                         conclusions regarding liquidity, funding stability, and
                                         management processes stopped short of considering
                                         other areas of the balance sheet, growth trends, asset
                                         quality, and management processes, etc. to support
                                         conclusions. Such issues are critical to the overall review
                                         process and should be captured and clearly conveyed in
                                         examination documents to supported supervisory
                                         observations. This is particularly important given that
                                         some banks may have tight liquidity positions including
                                         relatively high loan to deposit ratios.

                                         The central bank has taken a number of steps in recent
                                         years to support the strengthening of foreign currency

                                          funding. There appears to be an opportunity to
                                          strengthen liaison between the BRSA and the CBRT on the
                                          monitoring and management of foreign liquidity risk.
                                          Given the potential foreign exchange roll over risk
                                          residing in banks’ positions, consideration could be given
                                          to increasing the ultimate target for the FX LCR from 80%
                                          to 100% to further strengthen the management of
                                          liquidity risk.

25. Operational risk              C       Oversight of operational risk is anchored in RICAAP and
                                          further expanded in the GORM which comprehensively
                                          addresses relevant aspects of this risk. The supervisory
                                          process explicitly addresses this risk through the
                                          evaluation of the ICAAP process and reports submitted by
                                          banks as well as through the GAR process and as a part of
                                          MIS evaluation and controls during specialized
                                          examinations.

26. Internal control and audit    C       The legal framework is comprehensive in this area, both
                                          as it is articulated in the requirements for internal systems
                                          and separately as requirements specifically directed to the
                                          internal audit function. Review of the internal audit
                                          process is an important part of the onsite (GAR) process
                                          covered each supervisory cycle. However, targeted or
                                          specialized examinations of the internal audit process,
                                          leveraging the GAR results as well as specialized
                                          examination results as partial inputs, could enhance the
                                          validation of this important function. Such validation by
                                          the BRSA is important in order for it to maintain or
                                          increase the degree of confidence (and therefore,
                                          dependence) it can place in audit outputs as early warning
                                          indicators of shifting risk.

27. Financial reporting and       C       Procedures surrounding financial reporting and external
external audit                            audit are well established. Accounting standards closely
                                          follow IFRS and provisioning standards are set to dovetail
                                          with the implementation of IFRS 9. Valuation procedures
                                          for financial assets are comprehensive. BRSA conducts
                                          review of valuation procedures and of valuation models as
                                          a part of the onsite examination process. Parameters for
                                          banks’ external audit process are well established.

28. Disclosure and transparency   C       Banks are required to disclose their financial statements
                                          according to TFRS and TAS, the Turkish version of IFRS



                                                                                                      237

                                           and IAS, on both a solo basis and consolidated basis.
                                           Disclosure requirements for nonfinancial information are
                                           adequate. BRSA regularly evaluates the timeliness and
                                           content of external audit/annual reports for compliance
                                           with regulatory parameters and Pillar III disclosures.

 29. Abuse of financial services   LC      The scope of the assessment of this principle was limited
                                           to the applicable regulation and the BRSA activities. It did
                                           not include MASAK coordinated inspections and other
                                           activities.

                                           The AML law and related regulations form the framework
                                           to prevent the abuse of financial services. The framework
                                           includes customer due diligence (CDD) rules and
                                           procedures to report suspicious transactions but have
                                           shortcomings that need to be addressed. In particular, the
                                           CDD requirements should include a customer acceptance
                                           policy that identifies business relationships that the bank
                                           will not accept based on identified risks and enhanced
                                           due diligence on politically exposed persons. The
                                           framework should also require banks to report to the
                                           BRSA suspicious activities and incidents of fraud when
                                           such activities/incidents are material to the safety and
                                           soundness or reputation of the bank.

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS AND AUTHORITIES’
COMMENTS
A. Recommended Actions
Recommended Actions to Improve Compliance with the Basel Core Principles and the
Effectiveness of Regulatory and Supervisory Frameworks

Reference Principle         Recommended Action

Principle 1                 Subordinate the objective of development of the financial sector to the
                            objective of financial stability in the BL.

Principle 2                 Review the legislation to limit the cases that require the Minister’s
                            involvement with BRSA activities.

                            Improve the accountability framework to enhance the scrutiny of the
                            activities of the agency in relation to its objectives.

                            Create alternative arrangements that facilitate the possibility of hiring
                            experienced experts when needed.

Principle 5                 Impose requirements and assess if the bank’s board has a collective
                            sound knowledge of the material activities the bank intends to pursue.
                            Determine whether the home supervisor practices global consolidated
                            supervision, for cross-border banking operations.

Principle 8                 Develop a more profound risk assessment nature for the inspections.
                            Produce a clear view on the risks faced by and posed by the bank.
                            Derive implications of the specific findings for the broader risk
                            assessment of the bank.

                            Incorporate within the scope of special inspections issues that are
                            currently addressed only during the ratings phase.

                            Enhance the forward-looking components of the assessments: results of
                            the ICAAP need to be more thoroughly analyzed and discussed with
                            banks; stress tests results should play a larger role in the assessment
                            framework and; the ratings methodology could explicitly incorporate
                            the expected trend for each component.

                            Require banks to develop recovery plans.

                            Assess the resolvability of the banks.

Principle 9                 Develop policies and processes to assess the effectiveness and
                            integration of on-site and off-site functions, and address any




                                                                                                        239

                weaknesses that are identified. Consider the case for integrating the
                supervisory and enforcement functions.

                Improve communication with banks. The BRSA should consider setting
                policies establishing at least one annual meeting between supervisors
                and the board of the bank. Important analyses done by the BRSA, such
                as the stress testing exercises could also be more clearly discussed with
                banks.

 Principle 11   Incorporate the results of forward looking tools more heavily in the
                BRSA decision making process and act at an early stage to restore weak
                banks and correct unsound practices, even if formal prudential ratios
                have not been breached.

 Principle 12   Make further efforts to monitor and manage risks arising from
                nonbanking and from foreign activities or parent entities of a financial
                group. Deepen the analyses and strengthen BRSA techniques, such as
                group-wide stress testing, to monitor and assess these risks.

                Improve the recovery and resolution planning of large banking groups
                particularly once the necessary power is given to the supervisor by the
                expected new legislation. Consider scenarios where shocks originate
                from nonbanking entities or parent groups in such planning.

 Principle 13   Develop a framework for cross-border crisis coordination with relevant
                host authorities and the development of resolution plans that pay
                special attention to cross border issues.

 Principle 14   Develop a more comprehensive corporate governance regulation
                (and/or introduce changes to primary law) that completes the elements
                of governance that already exist in guidelines and regulation. Utilize this
                type of instrument as a focal point for supervisory corporate
                governance reviews in the future.

                Expand the qualifications of the collective board by requiring the
                majority to be composed of independent directors. Provide a
                comprehensive definition of independent.

                Expand the minimum number of (independent) directors on the audit
                committee.

                As bank activities warrant, separate risk management responsibilities
                from the audit committee and require that banks establish risk
                management committees.

                Enhance examination conclusions in special reviews by extending
                conclusions to comment upon the integrity and independent of

               relevant internal systems, the quality of management oversight and
               capacity, MIS and board reporting, etc.

               Develop a cross-cutting, more holistic assessment methodology for
               corporate governance which would, in part, leverage GAR and special
               examination results and relevant offsite information as well as
               information generated from any enforcement actions. Introduce such a
               review in order to enhance and better substantiate conclusions on the
               adequacy of a bank’s corporate governance.

Principle 15   See P 8 recommendation on further strengthening the ICAAP process.

               Require banks, commensurate with their size and activities, to have
               qualified CROs with sufficient stature, position and authority within the
               organization to oversee risk management activities, as the current level
               of senior manager as head of risk management (as enumerated in law)
               may not provide the stature necessary to challenge high level risk
               decisions and processes.

Principle 17   Evaluate and revise the relevant legislative and practical aspects of
               banks’ credit risk monitoring and risk management organizational
               arrangements. Address the independence and integrity of the internal
               credit risk rating process and the need for independent verification of
               line management ratings and actions and the functions’ ability to
               generate early warning information. Evaluate the implications of the
               current structure on the integrity and accuracy of monitoring and
               reporting to bank boards and the BRSA.

               Evaluate and revise the definition of credit classifications, particularly
               the special mention and substandard categories, making them more
               concise and clear cut, thereby enhancing their application by bankers
               and BRSA.

               Enumerate the BRSA’s position on rebooking of charged off credit in
               the REPL.

Principle 18   Upgrade written conclusions and write ups of credits classified during
               the examination process in order to more clearly substantiate the
               context of the classified credits and implications of findings on other
               areas, including management oversight and capacity, risk management
               process and accuracy, and ultimately corporate governance and
               financial statement accuracy.

                transactions with related parties, not just loans.

                Exercise caution on relaxing related party risk parameters and possible
                revocation of parameters surrounding board member borrowings.

 Principle 22   Deploy trained specialists to assess banks’ stress test approaches and
                the mathematical integrity therein and to leverage resulting
                advice/input on specialized exams.

B. Authorities’ Response to the Assessment 80
The BRSA of Turkey would like to thank the IMF, the World Bank, and the FSAP mission team for
their BCP assessment work. It must be noted that the whole FSAP mission brought forward essential
value added to the effectiveness of the supervisory process. BRSA intends to fully utilize the
assessment outcome as an opportunity to further improve and strengthen Turkey’s banking
regulation and supervision. BRSA will take into account and carefully consider recommendations
drafted by the FSAP mission team both within the scope of the actions that BRSA has already started
to take and for future arrangements towards increasing compliance with the Basel Core principles
for effective banking supervision. In fact, BRSA has already started on some of the mission team’s
recommendations and plans to work on the remaining recommendations under an appropriate
timetable.
It must be noted that since the assessments conducted in 2006 and 2011, the bar of the standards
has been raised by BCBS (the BCP methodology was revised in 2012). This assessment,
consequently, is not appropriate for comparison with either previous assessments or other
countries’ assessments.
BRSA has prepared a list of action points towards increasing compliance with the Basel Core
principles for effective banking supervision. BRSA also would like to express additional arguments
for some of the CPs in order to bring greater balance to the FSAP mission team’s assessment.
Responsibilities, Objectives and Powers; Independence and Accountability (Principle 1-2):
Although there is no explicit statement in the BL regarding financial safety and soundness is being
the primary objective, it is implied in BRSA’s regulatory and supervisory functions. All regulations
and sub-regulations as well as supervisory manuals issued stress the financial safety and soundness
objective of BRSA. Nevertheless, BRSA will review the current objectives and consider subordinating
the objective of development of the financial sector to the objective of financial stability in BL.
Regarding the limiting of the related ministry’s involvement with BRSA’s activities, there is an
ongoing process of drafting an amendment to BL that proposes the revocation of article 105 which
enables related ministry to file a lawsuit to revoke BRSB’s regulatory decisions.


80 If no such response is provided within a reasonable time frame, the assessors should note this explicitly and

provide a brief summary of the authorities’ initial response provided during the discussion between the authorities
and the assessors at the end of the assessment mission (“wrap-up meeting”).


                                                                                                                 243

BRSA will review its alternatives regarding the transparent scrutiny of its activities in relation to its
objectives and responsibilities without hindering its independence and autonomy.
Supervisory Approach, Techniques and Tools (Principle 8-9):
BRSA would like to note that within the current framework of supervision, all risks that banks are
exposed to as well as the financial safety and soundness of banks are adequately supervised and
BRSA has a well understanding of both individual banks and banking industry as a whole. However,
BRSA agrees with the assessment that supervision products need to have explicit and clear
narratives about supervisory view on the risks faced by banks. In this respect, BRSA has already
developed actions and started to revise its supervisory manuals and processes as part of an
established ongoing improvement framework.
BRSA will enhance forward-looking components of its supervisory framework by incorporating an
expected trend element for each CAMELS component and risk type within its ratings and risk
assessment methodology. Furthermore, BRSA is planning to fully incorporate the results of ICAAP
and stress tests to its supervisory framework and to increase the depth of the current analysis
conducted on stress test and ICAAP results.
In 2013, BRSA and SDIF have jointly established a working group to conduct a self-assessment of
current resolution procedures with respect to the FSB Key Attributes. Based on the
recommendations of this working group, a draft legislation has been prepared to align the national
framework with the above mentioned international standards. Currently, joint task group established
by BRSA and the SDIF has been reviewing the technical details to finalize the mentioned draft, which
includes the principles of recovery planning and resolvability assessment. BRSA will continue its
efforts to decrease the gaps in its regulatory and supervisory framework regarding recovery
planning and resolvability assessments.
In the organization of BRSA, on-site and off-site examination functions are organized under
different departments. Nevertheless, there are both formal and informal communication channels
between on-site and off-site functions in order to ensure effective supervision of banks. Periodic
bank-specific surveillance reports and sector-wide reports are sent to on-site examiner, and off-site
function is notified about the on-site supervision findings continuously. Enforcement departments,
which are responsible for formal correspondence of supervisory findings, are also organized
separate from on-site and off-site functions to serve as a mean for internal review and evaluation of
examination products. All of the supervisory findings stated in reports are communicated to bank
without exception formally by enforcement departments.
BRSA will review its alternatives in order to further improve coordination and integration among its
on-site, off-site examination and enforcement functions.
On-site examiners are in constant dialogue with banks management during the regular
examinations. In addition to entry and exit meetings held with senior management and audit
committee members, on-site examiners hold several meetings with banks managers and directors,
when needed. Furthermore, BRSA management also hold meetings with bank managers and
directors (especially the audit committee members) when there is an issue to discuss, although there
is no periodic meetings held with the whole board of directors. On the other hand, if there are

serious issues regarding bank and the actions stated in article 68, 69 and 70 are required, the
instructions are directed to BOD of the bank. In order to further improve the communication with
banks, BRSA will consider establishing periodic meetings between supervisors and the board of the
bank.
Corporate Governance (Principle 14)
The Turkish banking legislation is based on one-tier structure where the members of the board who
do not have any management responsibilities are non-executive members. In practice except the
general manager (CEO) who is a natural member of the board, the members generally do not have
management responsibilities in the bank. In order to ensure the existence of non-executive
members in the boards the BL has imposed banks to have minimum 2 non-executive board
members while in practice the majority of domestic systemically important banks do have more than
2 independent members in the board. This regulation is in line with the paragraph 47 of “Guideline
on Corporate Governance Principles of Banks”, issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision in July 2015, stating that board of the bank should be comprised of a sufficient number
of independent directors”. Furthermore, current executives (except general manager) of banks
cannot be elected as board members according to BRSB resolution.
Besides, RICAAP Article 6 defines the non-executive members in a way that is very similar to the
definition of independence given in the CMB Communiqués. Therefore, the non-executives are
expected to be objective and independent from the influence of other parties according to this sub-
regulation.
CMB’s Communiqué on Corporate Governance (CMB’s Communiqué), which is applicable to publicly
traded companies including banks, requires that (1) majority of board of directors should consist of
non-executive directors, (2) there should be independent directors who are able to perform their
tasks without any influence from the third parties, (3) the number of independent board members
should correspond to at least one thirds of the total number of members. Also, CMB’s Communiqué
elaborates the required qualifications of the independent board members, which are very similar to
the ones mentioned for non-executive members given in RICAAP.
Since 10 deposit banks in Turkish Banking Industry are publicly traded (6 of them are large scale
banks), they are subject to CMB’s Communiqué. As a result, a publicly traded bank with 5 members
of the board of directors is required to have at least 3 independent directors.
According to CMB’s Communiqué, these banks are required to include the Corporate Governance
Principles Compliance Report as a separate section in their annual reports. These reports should
involve explanations about the proper adoption of the CMB corporate governance principles (as
articulated in the Communiqué) and the conflicts of interest resulting from not wholly adopting
these principles. Furthermore, in these reports, banks are required to disclose the structure of their
board of directors, with reference to the number of non-executive as well as the number of
independent directors.
According to the above mentioned corporate governance compliance reports, number of board
members of the large scaled publicly traded banks range between 9 and 14. Five of these banks
have 2 members and one of them has 5 members in their audit committee. In addition to the


                                                                                                    245
TURKEY



independent members, who are also non-executive and members of the audit committee, publicly
traded banks have additional independent members in order to meet the requirements of the CMB’s
Communiqué. In that context, five of the large scaled publicly traded banks have 3 and one of them
has 5 independent members. All of these banks have the non-executive directors corresponding to
the majority of the total number of members, the number of non-executive directors ranging
between five and ten. In all cases, the chairman of the board of directors is non-executive.
With regard to the independency and objectivity of the board, principle 3 of the RCGP requires the
board of directors to be able to make independent evaluations about the operations of the bank. In
that context, the board of directors should make objective recommendations and should consist of
a sufficient number and composition of members providing the basis for a decision making process
free of any influence from other parties and free of conflicts of interest.
Furthermore, BRSA has communicated its expectations to banks regarding corporate governance
principles through RICAAP, RCGB and the best practice guidelines issued recently.
Nevertheless, for following the recommendations of FSAP mission team, BRSA will review its current
regulatory framework for Corporate Governance and will consider expanding the qualifications of
the collective board, reviewing its definition of “non-executive/independent member”, expanding
the minimum number of directors on the audit committee and explicitly requiring banks to establish
risk committees.
Currently, governance structures of banks are examined in detail within the scope of Special
Inspections conducted for Organization, Management and Strategy. In fact, in 2014 and 2015 three
Special Examinations were conducted in three banks and those examinations focused on corporate
governance issues. Besides, effectiveness and efficiency of corporate governance structure is also
assessed during CRRE process based on a number of criteria under the component of
“M”anagement. This assessment mainly focuses on effectiveness of board oversight, capabilities of
board of directors, board meetings, implementation of policies and procedures approved by board,
treatment of exceptions to limits or policies and procedures, contents of Board MIS. The conclusions
from this assessment affect the Management component rating and the final rating of the bank.
Furthermore, during Special Inspections conducted in other areas like loan portfolio or liquidity, if
examiners identify an issue that may be an indicator for a serious weakness in corporate governance
structure of bank, it is most certainly included in report in writing and it is communicated to the
bank immediately before the examination is finalized.
In order to further improve its supervisory framework for corporate governance, BRSA will enhance
its examination procedures for corporate governance issues in order to incorporate clear narratives
on implications of supervisory findings over integrity of internal systems, quality of management
oversight and capacity, MIS. BRSA will also consider conducting holistic assessment for corporate
governance in an appropriate time frame.
Credit Risk, Problem Assets, Provisions and Reserves (Principle 17-18)
In Turkey, organization of Credit Risk Management in banks, which is governed by RICAAP and
GCM, has four key parts: active board and senior management oversight over credit function,



246
                                                                                                 TURKEY



adequate loan policies and procedures, adequate credit risk measurement, monitoring and MIS,
adequate internal control and internal audit functions over loan activities.
Risk Management Unit within internal systems and credit monitoring departments are parts of the
credit risk management framework together with credit operations (back office), financial control,
internal control and internal audit functions etc.
According to GCM, loan activities of banks should be organized in a way that enables functional
segregation of duties and prevents any conflict of interest. In practice, in line with the principles
stated in GCM, loan activities of banks are organized under three main functions generally:
marketing, underwriting and monitoring, which are all line management functions. GCM requires
banks to establish these three functions separately without causing any conflict of interest.
Banks are required to have information systems that enable credit monitoring department to
conduct those functions on the basis of customer, group, and portfolio. According to GCM Principle
7, banks’ information systems related to credit monitoring are required to be based on reliable data
and should be validated periodically.
Besides to credit monitoring departments, internal audit is also an important function in credit risk
management framework. According to GCM, loan activities of banks are reviewed regularly by
internal systems units. Accuracy and reliability of reports submitted to the board of directors and the
audit committee is also reviewed by internal audit units according to RICAAP article 21.
According to REPL, banks are required to review their loan portfolio in terms of classification at least
quarterly and they are required to document those review for the largest 200 loans (or the ones
above 250.000 TL). The loan review documentation for the largest 200 loans is usually prepared by
internal audit. Besides, internal audit units conduct loan review within the scope of regular audit
activities.
The adequacy of banks’ credit risk management is assessed regularly by on-site examinations both
in Special Inspections and CRRE process. Loan activities are frequently subjected to Special
Inspections. In fact, in 2014 and 2015, 70 Special Inspections were conducted in 27 banks. During
Special Inspections, both size of the credit risk and the adequacy of the credit risk management are
assessed. If any weakness is identified during these special inspections, the issues are communicated
to banks both during the inspections and the formal correspondence stage. Furthermore, the
conclusions from special inspections are fed into CRRE process in which the final rating of the bank
is assigned.
Therefore, banks in Turkey have generally well established credit risk monitoring structures and
these structures are adequately supervised by BRSA. Nevertheless, following the recommendations
drafted by FSAP mission team, BRSA will review regulatory and practical aspects of credit risk
monitoring and risk management organizational arrangements in order to further improve the
independence, effectiveness and efficiency of the credit risk management organizations in banks.
Also, BRSA is planning to increase the standardization in examiner loan write-up so that they include
all relevant information needed to further substantiate the overall credit relationship, the
creditworthiness of the borrower and its impact on the overall credit exposure, and to incorporate

TURKEY



clear narratives in loan review reports regarding implications of findings on other areas such as
management oversight and capacity, risk management process and corporate governance.
Furthermore, BRSA will consider reviewing current definition of credit classifications in order to
make them more concise and clear cut.
To conclude, BRSA has recently issued an extensive number of best practice guidelines and made
numerous changes in regulations in order to increase compliance level of its regulatory framework
to international best practices. Although there is a natural time gap between regulations and
implementations, BRSA has committed itself to increasing compliance level of its regulatory and
supervisory framework and will take the remaining recommendations of FSAP mission in the Report
into consideration for future arrangements towards increasing compliance with the Basel Core
principles for effective banking supervision.
