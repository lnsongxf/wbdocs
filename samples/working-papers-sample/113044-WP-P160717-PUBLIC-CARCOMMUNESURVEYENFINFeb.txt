      Central African Republic
2016 National Commune Monography Survey

               February 2017
Foreword


At the international Donor Conference held in Brussels on November 17, 2016, the Government
presented its strategy for Recovery and Peacebuilding as reflected in the Recovery and
Peacebuilding Assessment (RPBA). The RPBA: (i) identified recovery and peace-building needs
and priorities and their associated financial costs; (ii) identified specific operational, institutional
and financial arrangements to facilitate the implementation of identified priorities; and (iii)
presented an approach to monitor implementation progress.
The RPBA was widely supported and donors expressed their confidence in the Government by
pledging over $ 2 billion in resources for projects to be implemented over the next 3 years. With
resources available, it is now time to implement. Doing so efficiently and effectively requires
timely and reliable information.
The results of the first National Commune Monography Survey offers just this. Not only are its
results timely, they are collected using an innovative survey design that allowed to collect
information across the territory, for every commune and for households living in every
commune, rapidly and at the fraction of the cost of a typical household survey. As such, by
repeating the survey regularly, this survey not only presents the first complete photo of the state
of the nation, it becomes the basis of a monitoring framework going forward.
The Local Development Index derived from the information collected by the survey and
presented in this report serves as an important tool for decision about the allocation of resources.
It allows to assess localities that are most deprived, and, by deriving the indicator regularly, to
assess progress over time.
This work is not only very relevant for decision makers in Government and other agencies, it
represents the frontier in statistical development. Up to date, representative information and the
associated monitoring tools will improve the way we work to better address the needs of the
citizens of CAR.

Executive summary
To collect information about the state of the nation and development priorities, l’Institut
Centrafricain des Statistiques, des Etudes Economiques et Sociales (ICASEES) conducted in
August 2016 a national survey, the Enquête Nationale sur les Monographies Communales. The
survey consisted of two components: a commune census which elicited information from all
commune authorities in the country, and a household survey which elicited information from
households in almost all communes across the country.
This survey is the first source of objective information on the state of the nation since the crisis.
As such, it covers some important data gaps. The commune census provides information on
conditions in all communes across the territory, including on local infrastructure, health and
education facilities, local governance, economic activities, conflict, security and violence, and on
local perspectives of security and policy priorities. The household survey complements the
commune census. It provides information on socio-economic well-being, perceptions of security
and economic conditions, and opinions on policy priorities. The household survey was conducted
in all but two communes, with 10 households interviewed in each. By conducting the commune
and household surveys simultaneously, it is possible to explore differences in perspectives
between local authorities and citizens.


State of the Nation
These survey results allow us to provide a snapshot of the state of the nation and to quantify
major needs, the extent of regional differences, and changes relative to 2012 (before the crisis).
The report presents a Local Development Index (LDI) that combines a range of policy relevant
indicators into a single measure. The LDI comprises variables across three different pillars that
are important for development: local administration, local infrastructure, and access to basic
services. By shedding light on conditions in a straightforward way, the LDI allows decision-
makers to quickly monitor progress across communes. This is the first time an LDI has been
prepared for CAR and in future rounds of the survey the definition of the composite index can be
refined as needed. Based on the current LDI, the commune census reveals that commune
administration offices are under-staffed and lack funding, that access to basic infrastructure such
as electricity, mobile phone coverage, banking services and road networks is low, and that access
to basic social services, such as public primary schools, health centers, and clean water is
limited, with large disparities between Bangui and other regions of the country.
Results from the household survey echo the challenging context that the commune census
presents. Education levels of individuals have been stagnant, and are lower in rural areas and for
women. Households generally have very few assets, and significantly less now than before the
crisis in 2012. Six out of every ten households are categorized as food insecure. Households on
average eat less than two meals per day and tend to consume low quality food, staples mostly.
Households are vulnerable to a variety of shocks and have inadequate coping strategies.
The household survey allows for explorations into crucial sub-populations such as internally
displaced persons and those working in mining. It is estimated that roughly 15 percent of
individuals are internally displaced. Half of the households had at least one member which was
ever displaced since the onset of the crisis in 2012. Households which have currently received

                                                 3
displaced individuals tend to be worse off in terms of asset ownership and food consumption,
and displaced children tend to miss more days of school. On another note, rough calculations
from this survey indicate that the artisanal mining sector is sizeable. A back of the envelope
calculation suggests that (during the harvest season in August) 100,000 individuals are involved
in mining. It appears that households in mining communes have better food consumption,
suggesting that mining has positive spillovers to households in the community.


Development Priorities
There is broad consensus among local authorities and citizens alike that the highest priority for
the country is achieving peace, reconciliation, and security. About 9 out of 10 communes, and 8
out of 10 households rank this as most important. The next priority is good governance and the
provision of basic services, followed by economic development. With respect to specific policy
interventions, the top five interventions identified by survey respondents are in order of
importance: (i) improve security through a reformed FACA (army) operating across the territory;
(ii) re-integrate ex-combatants; (iii) improve access to basic services (health, education, water);
(iv) improve road infrastructure; and (v) strengthen agricultural and livestock production.
Household perceptions of living conditions and opportunities indicate high expectations for
economic recovery and welfare improvements. Most households felt that their standard of living
was about the same or worse relative to 6 months prior to the survey. Looking ahead, the
majority of households were optimistic that their standard of living and employment
opportunities would improve in the coming year. Both urban and rural residents expressed this
optimism. Across prefectures, residents of Vakaga and Haut-Mbomou were the most doubtful,
while those in Mbomou, Ombella-M’Poko, and Nana-Mambere were the most upbeat about the
future. The majority of households perceived that ethnic and religious tensions had improved.


Building a Monitoring System
The Monographies Communales survey, with its nationwide coverage and demonstrated ability
to collect information rapidly and in a cost-effective manner, presents an objective feedback loop
for the state and citizens. It will form a key component of a new monitoring system that assesses
progress towards RPBA objectives. In future rounds of the survey, the commune census and
household survey can be fine-tuned and tailored to provide answers to new policy questions that
emerge. The survey can also be adapted to enable better inference about important subgroups
such as those in displacement camps, those in Bangui or in mining settlements.
A dashboard can be created to present information on tangible development outcomes (e.g.
number of functional schools; reach of the mobile phone network; availability of transport) as
well as to report on citizen perceptions (e.g. security; trust; whether life is improving). The
dashboard can integrate complementary information from other sources (e.g. prices; displaced
people; quality of roads) to offer a more complete picture of the state of the nation. When these
indicators are measured regularly over the course of the RPBA, they can demonstrate trends over
time.

1. Introduction


Few doubt the enormous challenges the Central African Republic (CAR) faces. Few also doubt
the need for reliable and up to date information to inform decision makers about the conditions in
the country. In its absence decision makers are restricted in their capacity to efficiently allocate
resources, to monitor progress of development programs, and to readapt programs as needs
evolve.
In a first effort to fill the existing data gap following the return to constitutional order in
February 2016, the National Statistics Institute (ICASEES) conducted in August 2016, a national
survey, with financial and technical support from the World Bank, to collect information about
the state of the nation and the development priorities of local authorities and citizens. This
survey, labelled Enquête Nationale sur les Monographies Communales, comprised of two
elements: a commune census and a household survey.
The commune census collected information on current conditions in all 179 communes of the
CAR and on the perspectives on security and policy priorities of local officials. In spite of
ongoing insecurity in parts of the country, this census was conducted successfully. Through
interviews with local authorities, information was gathered on local infrastructure, health and
education facilities, local governance, economic activities, conflict, security and violence. In
addition, the census asked about perceptions of socio-economic and security conditions in the
principal town of the commune, and about policy priorities for the commune with respect to
three themes: peace, reconciliation, and security; good governance and the provision of basic
services; and economic recovery.
The household survey collected information on household socio-economic well-being,
perceptions of security and economic conditions, and opinions on policy priorities,
complementing the data from the commune census. The household survey was conducted in all
but two communes, with 10 households interviewed in each. The two communes that could not
be covered due to armed groups and impassable rainy season roads are Ouandja-Kotto in Haute-
Kotto prefecture and Ouada-Djalle in Vakaga prefecture, both in in the northeastern area of the
country. By conducting the commune and household surveys simultaneously, it is possible to
explore potential differences in perspectives between local authorities and citizens, and to map
both the provision of services at the commune level and socio-economic well-being at the
household level.
The Monographies Communales survey will form the basis of a feedback system to inform
decision makers about progress. By conducting these surveys every six months, it will be
possible to obtain timely and reliable evidence of evolving needs and development progress in
CAR to inform decision making. With additional donor support, this feedback system can be
strengthened to improve monitoring and would complement other initiatives to strengthen data
production in CAR.

In this report, Section II characterizes recent conditions of the communes based on data elicited
from local authorities in the commune census and presents a composite index of indicators on
local administration, infrastructure, and basic services, called the Local Development Index
(LDI). Section III presents results from the household survey that describe the situation of
households and individuals with respect to topics such as education, wealth, consumption, and
vulnerability. Section IV presents the perceptions and development priorities of both local
authorities and households, and Section V concludes by summarizing key findings and by
describing the survey’s potential role in a monitoring system. Additional details on the survey
design and analytical methodology can be found in the Annex. As the report makes references to
regions in the analysis, the corresponding prefectures located in each region are summarized

2. Commune census

2.1. Introduction
Smallholder agriculture is the predominant economic activity, with 85 percent of communes
reporting agriculture as its primary economic activity. Livestock (35 percent of communes),
mining (18 percent of communes), and commerce (16 percent of communes) are listed as the
most common secondary economic activities (Figure 2.1). The capital, Bangui, is a notable
exception in which commerce and civil service are reported as the main activities. The most
common type of agriculture activity is cultivation of staple crops. For instance, 145 local
authorities list cassava as the first cultivated crop in their communes, and another 100 authorities
indicate peanut as the second most cultivated crop in their localities.
This predominance of agriculture highlights low economic diversification, and is accompanied
by no change in the structure of the economy compared to 2012. Nine out of 10 communes
indicate that their current key economic activities were similar to those before the 2012 crisis.
Figure 2.1: Main and secondary economic activities

Agriculture dominates the economy of CAR, which highlights low economic diversification.
In most communes, there is a predominance of agriculture activity, with   …Moreover, livestock, mining activity, and commerce are the most
                      the exception of Bangui                                              common secondary activities




While agricultural and livestock activities present the bulk of the economic activity in most
communes, services which are crucial to support these activities have declined in the crisis years.
For instance, only 4 percent of communes indicate that there is a store selling inputs such as
fertilizers, seeds, and phytosanitary products in the capital of the commune, down from 10
percent before the 2012 crisis. And, only 41 percent indicate the existence of veterinary services
in the commune, down from nearly 60 percent in 2012 before the crisis.
Communes being the smallest administrative divisions in the country, they are at the forefront
for the provision of services. Using data from the commune census the remainder of this section
assesses the state of communes across the nation. This assessment is organized around three


                                                                     10
pillars: state of the administration, availability of basic infrastructure, and provision of basic
social and economic services.
Consequently, in an attempt to produce a straightforward and sensible metric with which to
compare the current level of development across communes, indicators across the three pillars
are consolidated to produce a composite index, called the Local Development Index (LDI). The
LDI, shedding light on current conditions, may aid decision makers in allocating resources and
monitoring progress in communes. The LDI serves as a diagnostic tool intended to capture the
current conditions across CAR.
Before presenting the LDI and discussing the three pillars which comprise the LDI, this report
first briefly describes the economic activities across communes.
This report proceeds to discuss the three pillars of development in communes— local
administration, local infrastructure, and basic social and economic services— and then presents
the composite LDI.


2.2. Local administration
To be effective, local administrations require personnel, resources, and a secure environment to
work in. In most communes, local government offices, if they exist at all, are understaffed and
underfunded, suggesting that basic government functions cannot be executed. Furthermore,
gendarmerie and police forces are absent in a large share of the communes across the country.
Commune administration offices are under-staffed and lack funding; and the difficulty in
mobilizing resources has increased compared to 2012. Only 24 communes have 20 or more staff
in the municipal office. Furthermore, regular payment of civil servants remains a challenge,
where 9 in 10 communes report significant irregularities in paying their staff (Figure 2.2).
One third of all communes indicate not having received a budget allocation for 2016. Only 6
communes have an annual per capita budget of 2,000 CFAF or higher, while 41 communes have
an annual budget per capita ranging from 500 to 1,999 CFA Francs, and 75 communes have less
than 500 CFAF. Nearly all communes (95 percent) report difficulties in mobilizing resources for
government activities. This is a sharp increase compared to 2012 at which point only about half
of the communes recall having such difficulties.
Gendarmerie and police forces are absent in much of the central and eastern regions of the
country (Figure 2.2). Only 1 in 3 commune capitals have a gendarmerie present, and only 1 in 5
commune capitals have a police force present. These forces are concentrated in the southwestern
part of the country.

Figure 2.2: Local administration- funding and staffing in communes

There is low capacity for local governance as communes lack staff and funding. This is
combined with the absence of gendarmerie and police forces in many communes.
                                                       Resource mobilization has become increasingly difficult after the crisis

2.3. Infrastructure

Transport and communication infrastructure enables economic activity. However, essential
infrastructure— such as electricity, mobile phone coverage, banking systems, and roads— is
lacking throughout the country, and there are stark disparities between Bangui and the rest of the
nation.

* Infrastructure exists in an additional 6-7% of communes within the region but are not currently functioning; overall, only 57 % are functioning.



Access to water and electricity infrastructure is low, with only 1 in 10 communes connected
through the national electricity company (ENERCA) and 1 in 3 communes connected through
the national water company (SODECA). Only 1 percent of commune capitals in rural areas have
connectivity through ENERCA. On the other hand, all communes in Bangui report having
electricity. Electricity infrastructure is functional in Bangui, in a few communes in the
neighboring Ombella M’Poko prefecture, and in one commune each in Lobaye and Basse -Kotto
prefectures. Water infrastructure is limited with only 1 out of every 3 communes reporting either
distribution by the national water company (SODECA) or the availability of water pumps in the
commune capital. Coverage in Bangui is high, but in other regions, 17 to 60 percent of
communes have access to clean water infrastructure

There is limited mobile phone coverage and minimal access to banking services. Only four out of
10 commune capitals have at least one mobile phone provider in the commune capital (Figure
2.3).1 The national radio and television stations and Internet are available in even fewer
communes. In contrast, all communes in Bangui have mobile phone coverage. In other urban
areas and rural areas, only 68 and 23 percent of communes, respectively, have at least one
mobile phone provider in the commune capital. Furthermore, only 1 out of every 10 commune
capitals have some form of banking system, which is either a bank agency or a local credit
mutual.

    In CAR, reported mobile phone providers are TELECEL, MOOV, ORANGE, AZUR, and SOCATEL.

                                                                        13
The roads connecting communes to Bangui are often impassable through much of the year, and
the cost of transportation is high, especially in remote areas. Half of the communes report that
roads to Bangui are only accessible for some months out of the year with 50 percent reporting
that roads are inaccessible 4 to 6 months of the year (Figure 2.3). About 3 in 4 communes report
transport costs to Bangui at more than 25 CFAF per kilometer per person. Traveling from the
Northeast to Bangui is the most expensive, while travelling from communes in the South close to
Bangui is relatively cheaper. Most of the roads which connect the Northern communes to Bangui
are not accessible for some months out of the year, while those which connect the Southwest
communes to Bangui are accessible all-year round.

Figure 2.3: Local infrastructure- mobile phone coverage, banking services, and roads

Essential infrastructure—such as mobile phone coverage, banking services, and roads— is
lacking in many communes.




2.4. Access to basic social and economic services

Access to basic social services, such as public primary schools, health centers, and clean water is
limited, especially outside commune capitals. Among the 10 largest localities (villages/quartiers)

                                                14
of each commune, functional public primary schools and clean water sources (i.e. tap, pump, or
protected well) are present in 44 and 43 percent of localities respectively, and only 18 percent
have functional health centers (Figure 2.4). Access to basic social services in commune capitals
is better. Most commune capitals have public primary schools and health centers, 83 and 62
percent of communes, respectively, implying that 17 respectively 28 percent of commune
capitals lack basic education and health services! However, access to clean water and sanitation
systems remains a challenge even in the commune capitals. Only 36 percent of the communes
report having clean water access points in the capitals, with the national water company
SODECA operational in just a handful of communes. Only six percent of communes report
having a sanitation system.
Figure 2.4: Access to basic services- primary schools and health centers

Access to basic social services, such as primary schools and health centers, is limited.




According to local authorities, a lack of facilities and shortage of qualified personnel are the
largest barriers to provision of basic services. Local officials indicate that the provision of health
services is hindered by a lack of health facilities and a shortage of doctors and nurses. For
primary schools, the main challenges cited the insufficient number of teachers or the lack of
teacher qualification (40 percent of communes), the lack of functioning schools (24 percent of
communes), and insecurity (14 percent of communes). For secondary schools, similar challenges
are cited with the lack of functioning schools cited as the greatest constraint. The number of
public schools has decreased compared to the pre-crisis year, in particular in Region 3, Region 4,
and Region 6.

Note: These results represent the perspectives of the local authorities in the communes.

NGOs are active in most communes across the country, partially compensating for some gaps in
public service delivery. More than 83 percent of communes indicate that NGOs are active in
their communes (Figure 2.5). Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is present in 28 communes in
CAR, and most of its activities are in the Prefectures of Ouham, followed by Mambere Kadei.
The second and third largest NGO present in the country are respectively, the Agency for
Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC).
Most of their activities are in Ouham Pende.

emergency actions focus on the South-Eastern part of the country and on Bangui. IRC focuses its
activities on medical care, water and sanitation services, and protection for vulnerable women
and girls. Their activities are focused in Bangui, Ombella M’Poko, Nana Gribizi, Ouham Pende,
and La Kemo. The DRC implements various programs, with emergency education and
reintegration of children serving integral parts of its efforts. The NRCs largest programs are
education and water and sanitation.

In combination with limited health and education services, a formal judicial system is effectively
absent. At the time of the survey, a total of 24 courts are reported to exist, but six of these 24 are
not functioning, and four prefectures (Ouham, Kemo, Nana-Gribizi, Mbomou) report having no
functioning court to settle legal disputes. As a result, citizens must resort to other conflict
resolution mechanisms. In about 9 in 10 communes, traditional authorities are sought after to
settle disputes.


2.5. Local Development Index (LDI): a composite measure of commune capacity


The preceding sections have described the situation of the communes along three pillars: local
administration, local infrastructure, and access to basic social and economic services. This
section presents a Local Development Index (LDI) which combines 12 indicators from these
three pillars into one composite index. The composite index is thus a measure of the state of
service provision in each commune.

The LDI ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating the best possible scenario of service
provision. Each pillar is also attributed a score which ranges from 0 to 100. The LDI is a
weighted sum of these pillar scores, with equal weight (equal to one-third) for each pillar.
However, within a given pillar, each indicator is not necessarily attributed the same weight, so
that some indicators are weighted more heavily in the LDI than others. Definitions of the set of
indicators for the index are further explained in the Annex.
The LDI score is low for most communes; but, compared to other communes in the country,
those located in Region 1, Region 2, and Region 7 are more likely to be in the top quintile of the
LDI (Figure 2.6). The LDI is low for a large share of communes, indicating the need for
substantial improvements across the country. Among the three pillars which form the LDI, local
infrastructure has a higher variance across communes, whereas access to basic services is
relatively homogeneous across communes.
Communes in the southwestern regions Region 1, Region 2, and Region 7 rank higher in the LDI
rankings. The regional average LDI for Region 1, Region 2, and Region 7 are above the national
average, while the regional average LDI for Region 3, Region 4, Region 5, and Region 6 are
below the national average (Figure 2.6). Five communes (Baboua, Berberati, Haute-Kade,
Bouar, Yobe-Sangh) out of the 10 communes with the highest LDI are in the region 2. On the
other hand, six communes (Lili, Yambele, Ngandou, Seliba, Kotto, Mbelima) out of the 10
communes with the lowest LDI are in Region 6 (See Table 6.2 in Annex for a comprehensive list
of communes and their respective LDI).

3. Household Survey


This part of the report presents descriptive analysis of data from the household survey. The
household survey sample consists of 1,767 respondents. Via a household roster the household
survey includes information on 10,551 individuals and information on school attendance for
3,535 school-aged children between 6-17 years old. Based on the household survey estimates,
about 15 percent of individuals are currently internally displaced.

Weights were used in analyzing the household survey data to adjust for the population shares
based on the 2003 census in rural and urban areas in each of the 17 prefectures of the CAR, for a
total of 33 strata (Bangui, which is its own prefecture, is strictly urban). Each household within a
given stratum is assigned an equal weight. Recognizing the limitations of the sampling design
and outdated sample frame, more complex weighting schemes were not utilized. Moreover, the
broader findings are generally unaffected whether weights are used or not, including a simpler
weighting strategy based on three strata – Bangui, other urban areas, and rural areas.

Given the limitations to the sampling procedure and its implications on how representative the
sample is of the current population, we present data from the survey, without necessarily making
absolute claims. Due to the small sample sizes in smaller geographic areas, we limit the level of
disaggregation of the analysis to higher levels such as by rural and urban, by region, by agro-
ecological zone, and by mining vs non mining areas. For reference, the corresponding
prefectures located in each region are summarized below in Table 1.1.

We further caveat all description of the internally displaced individuals in this survey with the
fact that displacement camps were not included in the sampling frame. Moreover, settlements for
small mining were also not included, despite such sector potentially covering a non-negligible
part of the population. Nonetheless, this survey fills an enormous gap as it collects information
on a comprehensive range of outcomes from households spread across the entire country.


3.1. Profile of households

Households are primarily large, young, male-headed, and rural. Approximately three out of five
households are in rural areas, and two out of three households have five or more household
members (Table 3.1). Households are large in both urban and rural areas. Only one in five
households are female-headed households. While there are relatively few married individuals,
most of the individuals are in formal unions. Alongside considerable ethnic diversity, there
exists a small Muslim minority, around six percent of individuals. This is smaller than the 15
percent estimate from the 2003 census, and we caveat that this is likely due to limitations to the
survey design. The population is fairly young; seven out of every ten men and of women are
under the age of 25.

Most households are self-employed and in agriculture. In urban areas, seven in ten household
heads are self-employed, and in rural areas nine in ten household heads are self-employed
(Figure 3.1). In rural areas, nine in ten household heads have agriculture as the main income-
generating activity, while in urban areas four in ten household heads have agriculture as their
main income-generating activity. Apart from agriculture, household heads in urban areas are
engaged in commerce and public administration.

Households in Bangui are, as expected, different than in other urban areas of the country. In
Bangui, only four percent report being in agriculture, 37 percent are engaged in commerce, and
about 10 percent are students. Moreover, only half of those in Bangui report being self-
employed. The analysis on the household survey will not attempt to make more explicit

Before describing conditions on education, wealth, and consumption, we discuss a few key
dimensions that this report will explore: agro-ecological zones, mining vs non-mining areas, and
internally displaced persons.

Agro-ecological zones

The country is divided into four agro-ecological zones (Figure 3.2). The Sudan-Sahelian zone is
in the northern-most part of the country, where only 5 percent of the population reside. This
overlaps with the hunting and tourism livelihood zone. The Sudan-Guinean zone, with 29
percent of the population, overlaps with the cotton, cereals and livestock zone. The Sudan-
Obanguien zone, with 39 percent of the population, overlaps with the zone of cereals and
livestock. The Equatorial Forest zone in the southern-most part of the country is where about 27
percent of the population reside.

Based on the commune census, across all agro-ecological zones cassava is the main food crop,
followed by groundnuts. There is some maize production in all agro-ecological zones, except in
the Sudan-Sahelian zone, where millet is relatively more prominent. There is substantial cash
crop production in the Equatorial Forest zone where over 70 percent of communes produce
coffee, and over 20 percent of communes produce cotton. In Sudan-Guinean zone, 40 percent of
communes produce cotton, whereas in Sudan-Obanguien zone about half of the communes
produce coffee. Apart from the Sudan-Sahelian zone, there is some mining across agro-
ecological zones. About half of the communes in the Equatorial Forest and Sudan-Obanguien
zones report some mining activity.

The data used in this analysis to classify agro-ecological zones comes from the commune level
survey. As the four agro-ecological zones do not overlap perfectly with the administrative
regions of the CAR, the classifications for the communes is a rough approximation.


                                                               22

Mining

There is some indication that some working-age men are missing from the sample, and that these
missing men may be working in small scale mines. Males aged 21-40 comprise 23 percent of all
males, whereas females aged 21-40 comprise 28 percent of all females.

Apart from the obvious candidate explanation which is that the missing men may be involved in
conflict-related activities or may have experienced higher mortality rates due to conflict, another
potential explanation is that the missing men are working in small scale mining. In communes
where mining is one of the top three economic activities 20 percent of males are between the
ages of 21-40, whereas in communes where mining is not one of the top three economic
activities 24 percent of males are between the ages of 21-40 (Figure 3.4). Moreover, those
working in small scale mines may have migrated from non-mining communes to mining
communes so that comparing missing males in mining and non-mining communes may be an
understatement of the size of small scale mines.

On one hand, this finding highlights the fact that the survey did not include informal mining
settlements, and as such we caution that this informal mining sector will be missing from the
core of the analysis. In fact, under one percent of individuals report mining as their primary
activity. On the other hand, this finding in and of itself highlights that the mining sector is
possibly sizeable and important. A back of the envelope calculation from this household survey
would suggest that 4 percent of males aged 21-40 may correspond to 100,000 individuals in a
population of 5 million. This is not unreasonable, and in fact, is quite a conservative measure. In
2010, prior to the crisis, a report from the International Crisis Group (ICG) estimates about 80-
100,000 miners in the CAR, while a report from USAID report on Property Rights and Artisanal
Diamond Development in the CAR estimate that there were about 400,000 miners including
artisanal laborers. In this report, as an initial attempt to capture potential welfare effects of small
scale mining, the welfare indicators of households in mining communes are compared to those in
non-mining communes.

Internal displacement

The survey estimates that about 15 percent of household members are currently displaced, and
more than half of the households have experienced the displacement of some or all of their
household members since 2012 (Figure 3.5). We caveat this result by noting that the UN OCHA
reports closer to 10 percent internally displaced persons. This difference again may be owing to
the limitations to the survey and sampling design. In urban areas, 68 percent of households have
experienced the displacement of some or all of the household members since 2012, and in rural
areas 61 percent of households have. Among these households which experienced displacement,
roughly half have had their entire household displaced since 2012.

Compared to other regions, Region 3 and Region 5 have a larger share of current household
members as internally displaced individuals (Figure 3.5). Specifically, about one out of three
individuals surveyed in Region 3 and Region 5 is a displaced individual. In contrast, in the
southern regions Region 1, Region 2, and Region 6 less than one out of every ten individuals is a


                                                  24
displaced individual. We again caveat that the figures for region 5 are more imprecise. Region 5
has fewer observations due to the fewer number of communes in that region.

Compared to individuals who are not displaced, the displaced individuals are more likely to be
Muslim and of the Sara or Kaba ethnicity (Table 3.1). Apart from this, there are no other striking
demographic differences between displaced and non-displaced individuals— the civil status,
gender, age, and urban-rural composition is similar between internally displaced and non-
displaced individuals. Among the displaced, we see missing males as we previously noted for the
overall population, in that the proportion of individuals who are aged 21-40 years old is about
seven percent less for males than for females.

Many of the currently displaced individuals have only been recently displaced, and those who
have been displaced for longer tend to be located in urban areas. Overall, about one of every
three internally displaced individuals have only been displaced less than 6 months ago. Those
displaced into rural areas seem more transient than those displaced into urban areas. While one
of every three urban displaced individuals have been displaced more than 2 years ago, less than
one of every ten rural displaced individuals have been displaced more than 2 years ago.

Educational attainment is low, especially in rural areas. Among those 18 years and older, two out
of every five individuals in rural areas have never gone to primary school, and only one out of

                                                                                                                                 26
every five individuals in rural areas have at least completed primary school and acquired some
secondary schooling (Figure 3.6). While education levels are higher in urban areas, they are
nonetheless quite low—close to one out of every three individuals over the age of 18 have never
gone to primary school.

Females have lower levels of education than males, but improvements among younger female
age cohorts are narrowing this gender gap. For males, there has been little to almost no
improvement in education levels across all age cohorts. Among current school-aged males (6-17
years of age), 19 percent still do not have any primary education. This is only slightly lower than
the group of males who were over 45 years old, for which 25 percent do not have any primary
education. In contrast, education has been improving for younger female age cohorts. For
females over 45 years old, 67 percent do not have any primary level education, whereas for
current school-aged females, aged 6 to 17 years, 28 percent do not have any primary education.

Although the gender gap is narrowing, females still seem to be stopping school earlier than males
and are more likely to miss days of school. For example, the gender gap in current school
enrollment is much more prominent for those 15 to 17 years old than those for younger ages.
And, there are more females than males who are enrolled but having to miss days of school for
those 12 to 14 years old.

Among those who are currently enrolled, about 40 percent have had to miss days of school in the
past 6 months. Of those who had to miss days of school, insecurity is reported by many to be a
reason for having to have missed school (Table 3.2).

The data from the household survey cannot be used to distinguish between completing grades of
primary school versus completing primary school education. But, a few estimates can be
provided. The lower bound estimate on primary school completion would be the proportion of
those who had completed at least some levels of secondary education more. For males, the lower
bound estimate of primary school completion is 39 percent for those 18-35, 33 percent for those
36-45, and 37 percent for those 45 and older (Figure 3.6). For females, the lower bound estimate
of primary school completion is 18 percent for those 18-35, 17 percent for those 36-45, and 9
percent for those 45 and older. This echoes the same trends of overall low and stagnant education

levels, higher education for men than for women, and the existence of some improvement in
women’s education.


3.3. Wealth and food consumption

Households own very few domestic and productive assets. Reflecting the prevalence of
subsistence agriculture, small agricultural tools such as a hoe or daba are the most common asset,
owned by six out of ten households (Figure 3.7). Ownership of more valuable productive farm
assets are rare. For example, fewer than five percent of households own carts, ploughs, or oxen.

Having lost many of their assets during the crisis, households are much less wealthy today
compared to 2012. Households now have fewer productive assets, means of transport, and
household items. For example, the share of households that own the following items decreased
noticeably from 2012 to 2016: a bed or mattress (61 to 46 percent), a radio (42 to 23 percent), a
bike (30 to 15 percent), a cart, plough, or oxen (from 10 percent to less than 5 percent).

A wealth index is used to rank households and categorize them into wealth quintiles for
distributional analysis. (See the annex for the construction of the wealth index.) Households in
the bottom quintile of the index, or the most asset poor households, own almost nothing. Some of
the most asset poor households, about one third, own hoes or dabas and mobile phones. In
contrast, almost all the households in the top wealth quintile own household furniture, such as
beds and mattresses, and dining and living room furniture.

The poor tend to be in the northern regions Region 3, Region 4, and Region 5, and similarly in
the two northern agro-ecological zones (Figure 3.7). In Region 4, 51 percent of households are in
the bottom 40 percent of the wealth index, and in Region 3 and Region 5, close to 60 percent of
households are in the bottom 40 percent of the wealth index. Similarly, in the northern Sudan-
Sahelian and Sudan-Guinean zones, over 50 percent of households belong in the bottom 40
percent of the wealth index. In contrast, in Region 6 and Region 7, only about 15 to 20 percent of
households are in the bottom 40 percent of the wealth index.

In addition to low wealth, households consume little and low quality food. In both urban and
rural areas, households eat less than two meals per day on average. And during a week,
households have had to reduce the quantity of food about two days in a week, reduce the number
of meals 1.4 days in a week, and reduce the adult share of food about one day in a week (Figure
3.8). Households primarily consume staples (about five days in a seven-day period), and eat less
meat and fish products. Over a seven-day period, a household on average consumes staple food
product about five days, and in contrast consumes meat and fish products about only one to two
days.

The Food Consumption Score (FCS) is a tool designed by the World Food Programme to
measure the frequency and composition of household food consumption based on the number of
days in a seven-day period a household consumed each of nine different food categories. The
FCS is used as a basis to categorize households into the following food consumption categories:
poor (severely food insecure), borderline (moderately food insecure) or acceptable (food secure).
(See the annex for construction of the FCS.)

The survey estimates that about six in ten households are categorized as having poor or
borderline food consumption. Despite urban households being wealthier, there is little difference
between the food consumption of urban and rural households. While 42 percent of urban
households have acceptable food consumption, 36 percent of rural households do. While urban
households consume slightly more of oil, sugar, and meat and fish products, they consume less
of staples relative to rural households. Moreover, urban households have slightly fewer meals per
day on average, and have had to more often reduce the quantity of food during a week. There is
thus a significant strain in food consumption for urban and rural households alike.

Households that produce their own food tend to have better food consumption. This is in line
with the observation that urban households do not necessarily have better food consumption than
rural households. Among other ways to source food, households tend to either purchase their
food or produce their own food. For example, of households that consumed pulses over the past
seven days, 51 percent primarily produced their own pulses and 41 percent primarily purchased
their pulses.

The less wealthy have poorer food consumption, although this relationship between wealth and
food consumption is weak (Figure 3.10). Close to half of the households in the bottom wealth
quintile are categorized as having poor food consumption, whereas in the top wealth quintile
only 22 percent of households are categorized as having poor food consumption.

The geography of those with poor food consumption is similar, but not exactly equivalent, to the
geography of the less wealthy. Food consumption tends to be worse in the two northern agro-
ecological zones, where asset ownership is also low. In Region 1, Region 3, and Region 5, about
70-90 percent of households are considered to have poor or borderline food consumption. While
Region 3 and Region 5 are less wealthy compared to other regions, Region 1 is not. Thus,
although there exists some positive relationship between assets and food consumption, the
relationship is weak.

activities, a smaller proportion of households have poor food consumption and a higher
proportion of households have borderline food consumption relative to the proportion in
communes which does not have mining as one of their top three economic activities (Figure
3.11). But, households in such mining communes do not appear wealthier than those in non-
mining communes. Thus, small scale mining may have some positive spillovers to households in
the community in the sense of improved food security, but not in the generation of household
wealth. This is not to say, however, that this is the same spillover on households who directly
receive benefits from small scale miners, as the households which receive benefits from small
scale mining may not be in the mining communities.

Households who have received displaced individuals are currently less wealthy and have poorer
food consumption, and displaced children are more likely to miss days of school than non-
displaced children. Among households which have at least received one member who is
currently displaced, 59 percent are in the bottom two quintiles of the asset wealth index and 69
percent have poor or borderline food consumption (Figure 3.12). In contrast, among households
who do not currently have received displaced members, 36 percent are in the bottom two
quintiles of the asset wealth index and 56 percent have poor or borderline food consumption.
School-aged displaced children have the same rates of current school enrollment as the non-
displaced, but the school-aged displaced children are more likely to have missed some days of
school in the past six months.

While those who received the displaced are poorer, there does not exist a strong relationship
between whether a household had at least one member becoming displaced since 2012 with
household wealth and food consumption. On one hand, households which have experienced
(sent) displacement since 2012 are only slighlty less wealthy than those who did not experience
displacement at all since 2012 (Figure 3.12).

On the other hand, households which have experienced (sent) displacement since 2012 have
slightly better food consumption than those who did not experience displacement. Altogether,
these results suggest less of a clear pattern between displacement since 2012 and welfare. One

possible explanation is that the effect of displacement dissipates through time. An earlier caveat
is worth mentioning: the survey does not capture huseholds in displacement camps.


3.4. Shocks and Coping Strategies

Many households, especially urban households, were negatively affected by food price increases.
This increase in food prices is in line with the observed low food consumption for urban
households and for households which primarily purchase, instead of produce, their own food.
Eight out of every 10 households have experienced an increase in food prices in the past 30 days
(Figure 3.14). From a list of 24 negative shocks or events, 20 percent of urban households report
that the increase in food prices was the shock that affected the household the most.

Food prices are reported to have increased for most food items, especially meat and fish
products, items which tend to not exist in the household diet. Food items for which prices seem
to not have increased are those which are mostly not consumed by households, such as sorghum
and millet (Figure 3.13). Relatively, the most stable prices are those for food items which are
traditionally not cash crops such as cassava, maize, and peanuts.

Households are still affected by conflict; one in three households experienced direct negative
effects of conflict in the 30 days prior to the survey, such as conflict or violence in one’s locality,
displacement, theft, destruction of assets, serious illness and death (Figure 3.14). In urban areas,
15 percent of households report experiencing conflict in their locality in the past 30 days,

                                                                 34
whereas much fewer households in rural areas report such. Beyond conflict or violence in the
village, a similar number of households experienced other direct effects of conflict, namely
displacement, theft, destruction of assets, serious illness and death. So that overall, 33 percent of
urban households and 36 percent of rural households experienced some direct negative effect of
conflict in the past 30 days. More households in Region 4 and Region 6 report experiencing
conflict in their locality in the past 30 days. In those regions, about one in ten households report
experiencing conflict in their locality in the past 30 days.

Households in mining communes have experienced slightly less conflict in the past 30 days,
compared to households in non-mining communes. In mining communes, 14 percent of
households experienced conflict in their locality in the past 30 days, compared to 21 percent of
households experiencing conflict in their locality in the past 30 days. This would indicate that
informal small scale mining settlements are experiencing more stable security.

Other shocks also affect households in the CAR. In the past 30 days, more than half of the
households that did not experience conflict or violence nonetheless experienced increases in
transport costs and food prices (Figure 3.14). Moreover, in the past 12 months, households
experienced naturally occurring events such as drought, irregular rainfall, and flooding. The food
consumption score of those that experienced such shocks in the past 12 months is on average
lower than those who did not experience such shocks.

While households are subject to a variety of shocks, these same households have inadequate
resilience to weather these shocks. The lack of resilience contributes to the link between the
experience of shocks and low food consumption. Households have low capacity to cope with
future shocks either because they depleted an existing resource to deal with a current shock or
because they never had such resources to begin with. In the past 30 days, only 40 percent of
households did not experience a potentially detrimental strategy to cope with the lack of food. A
household is said to experience a given strategy if either they had recently engaged in the
strategy or if they did not have that resource, which is a signal for prior depletion of that
resource.

Potentially detrimental strategies to cope with food shortages can be categorized into the
following: stress, crisis, and emergency strategies. Stress strategies, such as borrowing money or
spending savings, are those which indicate a reduced ability to deal with future shocks due to a
current reduction in resources or increase in debts. Crisis strategies, such as selling productive
assets, directly reduce future productivity, including human capital formation. Emergency
strategies, such as selling one's land, affect future productivity, but are more difficult to reverse
or more dramatic in nature. (Source: WFP CARI Technical Guide, November 2015)

Regions with low food consumption scores tend to have poor strategies to cope with the lack of
food. In Region 6, four in 10 households have exhausted or do not have available an urgency or
crisis coping strategy, whereas in the Region 5 which has worse food consumption, eight in 10
households have expended or does not have available an urgency or crisis coping strategy. Thus,
the less well-off households are also the less resilient households.

While the most commonly used coping strategies by households are the less drastic stress
strategies, such as spending savings, borrowing money or selling household assets, many
households simply do not have these strategies as an option. Close to one in five households
spent their savings or borrowed some money in the past 30 days to cope (Figure 3.15). But, what
is more striking is that more households did not have these resources available to them. About
one in three households do not have savings to deal with the lack of food, and similarly about
one in three households do not have any domestic assets to sell to deal with the lack of food.
Echoing the lack of domestic assets is the lack of productive assets or transport to sell in order to

                                                                                  37
deal with the lack of food. While 10 percent of households sold a productive asset (a crisis
strategy) to deal with the lack of food, another 42 percent did not have such productive assets to
sell. So that overall, at least 52 percent of households are said to have experienced this particular
crisis coping strategy.

It is not necessarily true, however, that households with more assets are better able to weather
shocks. The food consumption of wealthy households is more affected by droughts, irregular
rainfall, or flooding. Relative to households in the bottom two wealth quintiles, the food
consumption of households in the top two wealth quintiles is more negatively correlated with
experiencing drought, irregular rainfall, or flooding (Figure 3.16). This is in line with the earlier
result in which we see a weak correlation between wealth and food consumption.

One potential explanation is that previously wealthy households have sold their assets to improve
food consumption in response to a shock, so that they now appear poorer. Another explanation is
that even the rich do not have the right assets or do not have decent market access to divest their
assets in response to a shock, so that the sale of assets is not an effective coping strategy.
Regardless, this mismatch between wealth and resilience highlights the fact that coping strategies
are likely weak for both the wealthy and the poor.

Community groups can be a conduit for mutual support, but membership in community groups is
generally low. Thus, these community groups are an unlikely coping strategy for households in
the CAR. Apart from saving, borrowing and selling assets, community groups can also be
leveraged as a channel for mutual support and exchange for households to cope with shocks, but
there is little involvement in such semi-formal community groups. In urban areas, only 24
percent of households in urban areas and 38 percent in rural areas have a household member who
is part of a community group (Figure 3.17). Membership in these community groups has been
consistently low. Compared to before 2012, there has been no change in the proportion of
households which was part of a community group or association. Membership in tontines, small

group saving schemes, is also low, roughly one out of every five households were part of a
tontine in the past six months. It is likely, however, that other mutual support exists at a less
formal level, such as informal networks of friends and neighbors.

4. Perceptions and Priorities

Objective measures of access to services at the commune level and living conditions at the
household level highlight the need for substantial improvements in the provision of a broad range
of services. Beyond such objective measures, the survey further elicited from households and
commune representatives, their perceptions of security and socio-economic welfare, as well as
their views on priorities for development.
Information on perceptions of security and welfare provides a glimpse into current progress and
optimism for future progress. Moreover, while substantial and simultaneous improvements
across all areas are ideal, resources are scarce and understanding the urgency of various
interventions can aid decision-makers in timing these interventions. Information on priorities for
development contributes to this end.
4.1. Perceptions of security and socio-economic welfare

Many households perceive that the security situation in their localities is stabilizing. Most
households perceive the security situation to be improving or to have remained the same in the
past six months. Only under 15 percent of households perceive the security situation to have
worsened (Figure 4.1). Compared to other regions, more households in Region 1, Region 2, and
Region 7 perceive the security situation to have improved. This perception is consistent with
recent experience of conflict, wherein more households in Region 4 and Region 6 experienced
conflict in their locality in the past 30 days.

which trust armed groups (Figure 4.2). The same pattern on trust in FACA vs armed groups
holds across regions and for both communes with and without armed group presence.

Perceived improvements in conflict and ethnic and religious tensions are contrasted with the
perceived worsening of the general economic condition and access to basic services over the past
six months (Figure 4.3). These perceptions are similar for households and commune
representatives.

About eight in 10 households perceive that the employment situation has worsened. About seven
in 10 households perceive food security to have worsened, which is unsurprising given the
generally low food consumption score across households. Moreover, about half of the
households perceive access to basic services, such as education, health care and clean water, to
have worsened. This highlights the fact that an 80 percent enrollment rate in primary school is
likely missing much of the education picture—such as quality of education and access to post-
primary education.

However, most households expect that their quality of life will improve over the next 12 months
(Figure 4.4). The perceived worsening economic condition matches the household perception
that the quality of life has stayed the same in the past six months for 25 percent of households
and has worsened for 44 percent of households. But, most household expect that their quality of
life will improve over the next 12 months. Similar to the regional patterns on security, most of
those who expect improvements in the quality of life are in Region 1 and Region 2 around the
capital.

But while most did not see improvements in the quality of life over the past 6 months, many are

4.2. Priorities for Development

There is broad consensus among both local authorities and citizens that the highest priority for
the country is achieving peace, reconciliation, and security. This is followed by good
governance and the provision of basic services, and then economic development. With respect to
specific policy interventions, the top five interventions prioritized (among all options) by survey
respondents are the following, in order of importance: (i) improve security through a reformed
FACA (army) operating across the territory; (ii) re-integrate ex-combatants; (iii) improve access
to basic services (health, education, water); (iv) improve road infrastructure; and (v) strengthen
agricultural and livestock production (Figure 4.5).

Peace, reconciliation and security are the top priority; and improving security via a reformed
FACA is cited as top priority action.

Respondents were also asked about the top priority within each of the three categories. With
respect to the first category of peace, reconciliation and security, overwhelming support exists
for restoring security across the country through reformed defense forces (FACA), consistent
with the results above (Table 4.1). A distant second is the reintegration of ex-combatants. As for
good governance and provision of basic services, redeploying the administration throughout the

                                                                                  43
country was cited the most, in particular by residents of Bangui. On the other hand, improving
access to basic services is a high priority among residents living in other parts of the country
where access to health and education services are extremely limited. When it comes to economic
development, job creation is a high priority among residents of Bangui, while strengthening the
agriculture and livestock sectors, and building roads are priorities for residents living in other
areas, in particular in the more isolated eastern regions, Region 5 and Region 6.

5. Conclusions


This report presents results from a national survey conducted in August 2016, the Enquête
Nationale sur les Monographies Communales, which is aimed at filling a gap on baseline
information on the situation in the CAR and forming the basis for a monitoring system on service
provision and development outcomes. The survey consists of two components: a commune
census which elicited information from local authorities, and a household survey which elicited
information from households in nearly all communes across the country.
This section summarizes the findings from the commune and household components of the
survey, and elaborates on a monitoring system for the CAR. The commune census reveals
limited administration, infrastructure, and basic services across communes. Similarly, the
household survey reveals low and stagnant education levels, little wealth, poor consumption, and
high vulnerability to shocks. Communes and households in the southwest of the country tend to
do better, although large improvements have to be made across the country.


5.1. Summary of Findings: Commune census

Commune administration offices are under-staffed and lack funding; and the situation has only
worsened since 2012. Only 24 communes have 20 or more staff in the municipal office, with
regular payment of such staff remaining a problem. Moreover, 57 communes indicate not having
received a budget allocation for 2016.
Access to basic infrastructure such as electricity, mobile phone coverage, banking services and
road networks is low. Only about 1 in 10 communes report having electricity through ENERCA
connection or some form of public lighting in the commune capital, and only 1 percent of
commune capitals in rural areas have connectivity through ENERCA. Overall, only 4 out of 10
commune capitals have at least one mobile phone provider in the commune capital. Furthermore,
only 1 out of every 10 commune capitals have some form of banking system — either a bank
agency or a local credit mutual. Half of the communes report that roads to Bangui are not
accessible throughout the year.

Access to basic social services, such as public primary schools, health centers, and clean water is
limited, especially outside commune capitals. Among the 10 largest localities of each commune,
functional public primary schools and clean water sources are present in 44 and 43 percent of
localities respectively, and only 18 percent have functional health centers. Access to clean water
and sanitation systems remains a challenge even in the commune capitals. Only 36 percent of the
communes report having clean water access points in the capitals.
A Local Development Index is constructed to combine indicators across three pillars: local
administration, local infrastructure, and access to basic social and economic services. By

                                                45
shedding light on current conditions in a simple and straightforward way, the LDI may aid
decision makers in allocating resources and monitoring progress in communes.


5.2. Summary of Findings: Household Survey

The survey estimates that 15 percent of the individuals are currently internally displaced.
Furthermore, half of the households had at least one member which was ever displaced since the
onset of the crisis in 2012. The displaced are disproportionately in Region 3 and Region 5.
Households which have currently received displaced individuals are less wealthy and have worse
food consumption, and displaced children tend to miss more days of school. But households
which have had at least one member ever become displaced since 2012 are today only slightly
less wealthy and have better food consumption, suggesting less of a clear relationship between
wealth, welfare and the experience of displacement over a longer time horizon.

While households perceive the general economic condition to be worsening, they perceive the
security situation to be improving. About one in three households have experienced direct
negative effects of recent conflict or violence (in the past 30 days). Nonetheless, many perceive
that the security situation has improved, particularly for those in Region 1 and Region 2 around
the capital. The majority of households perceive that ethnic and religious tensions have improved
and are more optimistic about improvements in the quality of life over the next year.

Education levels of individuals have been stagnant. Education levels are lower in rural areas and
lower for women. While there has been some improvement in female education levels, female
children are still stopping school sooner. While current enrollment rates seem high, at around 80
percent among current school-aged children, half of households perceive that access to education
has worsened in the past six months. Thus, current enrollment may not be an adequate indicator
of education as it might not reflect the following: completion rates, days of attendance during the
school year, or the quality of education. In fact, 40 percent of those currently enrolled had to
miss days of school in the past 6 months, with insecurity mentioned by many as a reason for
having to have missed school. Among those over 18 years, only 37 percent of males and 17
percent of females have at least some secondary education.

Households have very little assets, and they have much fewer assets today than before 2012.
Furthermore, households have little and low quality food consumption with very little difference
between urban and rural areas. Households only own simple agricultural tools, and almost none
of other productive farm assets. Six out of every ten households are categorized as food insecure
(particularly having poor or borderline food consumption). On average, households eat less than
two meals per day, and mainly consume staples. Households in the two northern agro-ecological
zones are poorer and have poor food consumption. Despite urban households being wealthier,
their food consumption is not any better than that of rural households. Consistent with this
finding, food consumption is worse for household which do not produce their own food and the
increase in food prices has affected many households.

In combination with low wealth and poor consumption is high vulnerability. They are affected
by a variety of shocks, and they do not have the sufficient strategies to cope with the exposure to
shocks. Many households do not have (or have already expended) even the more primitive

                                                46
means to cope with the lack of food, such as spending savings, borrowing money, or selling
household assets. Furthermore, households which have more assets do not seem more shielded
from shocks than households which have fewer assets, suggesting that even those with assets do
not seem able to use the sale of their assets as an effective coping strategy. Membership in
community groups and tontines is also very low despite the fact that such groups can serve as
effective channels to cope with certain types of shocks via mutual exchange in communities.

Households and local authorities agree that peace, reconciliation, and security should be the main
development priority. About eight in 10 households and nine in 10 commune representatives
rank peace, reconciliation, and security as the top priority over good governance and the
provision of basic services and economic development. Many trust in the FACA (army) and only
a few trust in armed rebel groups, and this pattern holds across regions. Within the peace,
reconciliation, and security priority, the majority deem the restoration of security through the
FACA as the key policy intervention.

5.3. Building a Monitoring System
The Monographies Communales survey, thanks to its nationwide coverage and demonstrated
ability to collect information rapidly and in a cost-effective manner, can serve as the core for a
new monitoring system. By repeating this survey regularly, it can feed a monitoring system that
assesses progress towards RPBA objectives and presents an objective feedback loop for the state
and citizens.
Using a select set of indicators from the survey, a dashboard can be created to present
information on tangible development outcomes (e.g. number of functional schools; reach of the
mobile phone network; availability of transport) as well as report on citizen perceptions (e.g.
security; trust; whether life is improving). The dashboard can integrate complementary
information from other sources (e.g. prices; displaced people; quality of roads) to offer a more
complete picture of the state of the nation.
When these indicators are measured regularly over the course of the RPBA, they can
demonstrate trends over time with respect to RPBA implementation. Suggested is to repeat the
survey at least once every six months to track changes. As a complement to the dashboard,
progress made could be reflected in a national implementation report published on an annual
basis. Such a report would highlight achievements and challenges of RPBA implementation and
could also include information gathered through focus groups.
Monitoring alone serves little purpose if the information collected is not analyzed in a timely
manner, put into context, and interpreted in ways that facilitate decision-making. A small team of
2 or 3 dedicated analysts, with an independent statute, that operates under the guidance of RPBA
partners and the Authorities could ensure that relevant lessons are drawn from the available
information. The team would report on specific topics, produced at the request of its principals.
The analytical team would work closely with the National Statistical Institute, ICASEES,
responsible for the implementation of the Monographies Communales survey, and help identify
areas and issues on which additional information should be collected.



                                               47
Results need to be communicated to different stakeholders to ensure that monitoring processes
are meaningful and support better development outcomes. As such, an analysis and
communications strategy should be an integral part of the monitoring framework. In addition, to
facilitate transparency and confidence building, the dashboard and its underlying data should be
made publicly available, including through a web-portal.

6. Annex
6.1. Survey Design

The survey design for the Monographies Communales survey was tailored to the current context
in CAR, that is, a high level of insecurity, the need to collect data in a short period of time, and
hard budget constraints. A commune census covering all 179 communes in the country was a
central element of the design. As a supplement, a household survey component was added to
obtain perspectives of citizens. Given that armed groups continue to be active across the
territory, the safety of the survey teams was a critical consideration. The practical and cost-
effective solution for the household survey component was to limit the additional travel required
of enumerators in the field. Although the ideal sampling methodology could not be used, the
household socio-economic characteristics of respondent are in line with other national surveys.
The combination of the commune and household surveys provides a good representation of the
country and is a valuable source of information in filling data gaps and monitoring progress.

The field work for the Monographies Communales survey was conducted by 22 survey teams
over a 3 week period, from August 3, 2016 to August 24, 2016. Interviews were conducted
primarily in French for the commune census and in Sangho for the household survey, and paper
questionnaires were used for both. Enumerators participated in a week long training and piloted
both the commune and household survey questionnaires in Bangui and two communes in the
Ombella M’Poko prefecture.

Commune census
As all 179 communes in the country were covered, no selection procedures were required for this
component. In the principal town (chef-lieu) of each commune, survey teams interviewed
representatives from the local government (mairie) and other community leaders for the
commune census. Considering that respondents would have more accurate information on their
immediate environment, the questionnaire focused primarily on the situation in the chef-lieu of
the commune to improve the reliability of the data collected.

Household survey
The planned total sample size was 1790 households. In each commune, 10 households were
selected to be interviewed: 5 households from a randomly selected neighborhood of the chef-lieu,
and 5 households from a randomly selected village located 20 to 40 km from the chef-lieu.

Selection of the localities (village or quartier) and households: The list of localities in the
commune from the 2003 census was first updated through consultations with local authorities.
The names of villages located 20 to 40 km from the chef-lieu were written on pieces of paper,
and one was randomly drawn by a local official. This same process was used to select one of the
neighborhoods in the chef-lieu. In each of the selected localities, a simple listing of households
was completed, up to a maximum of 100 households. Using this list, 5 households were then
randomly selected for interviews.

Weights were used in analyzing the household survey data to adjust for the population shares
based on the 2003 census in rural and urban areas in each of the 17 prefectures of the CAR, for a

                                                49
total of 33 strata (Bangui, which is its own prefecture, does not have a rural area). Each
household within a given strata is assigned an equal weight.


6.2. Methodology


Local Development Index
The indicators used to construct the overall composite index measure the effectiveness of
government presence, the state of infrastructure, and the access to basic services in the
communes. First, the indicators set out the degree of the state presence. This represents the first
pillar and it is captured through a number of indicators, such as the budget per capita (in local
currency) allocated to the commune, the number of working staff in the Mairie, the presence of
security forces (gendarmerie and police). The second pillar of indicators assesses the availability
of basic infrastructures, such the existence of a mobile phone network, a banking system, and the
transport cost per km (to conjecture the cost of mobility across the country). The third and final
pillar measures the availability basic services in the communes, such as the availability of public
primary schools, the availability of a health center, a sanitation system, and access to clean
water.
The three pillars (local administration, infrastructure, and basic services) build up the overall
composite index. The maximum score for each pillar is 100 with each pillar equally weighted.
That is the weight for each pillar is one-third. However, some indicators within a pillar were
given a higher importance than others, and were therefore attributed different weights (see Table
A1, below).
Some of the indicators used to construct the sub-indices have missing data points. However, the
share of missing values for each indicator was usually below five percent of communes. To
address the missing data points and ensure that all 179 communes can be compared on the LDI,
values were imputed when missing. Specifically, the median (for continuous variables) or the
mode (for categorical variables) across communes for which data was available at the prefecture
level was used to replace missing values. Given the small number of communes for which some
indicators were missing, the imputed values do not dramatically affect the sub-indices, and
therefore do not affect the ranking of each Commune on the LDI.

Wealth Index
The asset wealth index is constructed using principal component analysis (with one rotation) on
11 variables which each indicate how much of a given asset is currently owned. The list of 11
assets consists of assets which are owned by at least 5 percent of the sample. The list includes the
following 7 household items (or set of items): beds and mattresses, armchairs and coffee tables,
radios, dining table and chairs, mobile phones, coal irons, and televisions, and the following 4
productive assets / means of transport: hoes or dabas, bicycle, motorbike, mill/crusher.

Food Consumption Score (FCS)
The FCS, designed by the WFP, ranges from 0-112. It combines into a single index the
household consumption of 8 different food categories across a 7-day period. The 8 categories
are: main staples, pulses, vegetables, fruit, meat/fish, milk, sugar, and oil, and excludes
condiments. Generally, the score is categorized into the following bins: 0-21 poor, 21.5-35
borderline, and >35 acceptable.
