      1. Introduction
We are witnessing a decline in the growth of trade and productivity. World trade grew at
approximately 3 percent per year from 2012 to 2016, which is much lower than the pre-crisis
average of 7 percent for 1994 to 2008. Productivity growth also has declined, to 1 percent per
year after the crisis from an average of 2 percent from 1994 to 2008 (figure 1).

Consider now the development of global value chains (GVCs) over broadly the same period.1
One measure of the importance of GVCs is the share of foreign value added embodied in gross
exports. Data on this measure from the recent update of the World Input-Output Database
(WIOD 2016) point to stalled or even negative growth in vertical specialization since 2011
(figure 2). World GVC participation had been increasing throughout the 2000s, but at a slower
rate than in the 1990s. The share of foreign content in manufacturing exports, an alternative

measure of vertical specialization, computed using a simplified methodology applied to trade
data from UN Comtrade (via WITS) and sectoral output data from WIOD, suggests a similar
dynamic.

Previous research has demonstrated that the slowing expansion in global value chains can
partially explain the current trade slowdown (World Bank Group 2015; Constantinescu, Mattoo
and Ruta 2015). Specifically, research has shown, first, that world trade is growing slowly not
only because GDP growth is sluggish, but also because the long-run relationship between trade
and GDP is changing. The elasticity of world trade to GDP was greater than 2 in the 1990s but
closer to 1 and declining throughout the 2000s. Second, the varying pace of the expansion of
GVCs is a key contributing factor of the changing long-run relationship between world trade and



                                                                                           3 
 
 
 

GDP. Changes in GVC participation over the period 1990 to 2014 at the world level account for
approximately half of the decline in trade elasticity to income. 2


This note investigates whether changes in vertical specialization, as manifested in GVCs, can
explain the current productivity slowdown. Trade in general can lead to productivity gains
through multiple channels that are the object of a large body of research.3 As far as participation
in GVCs is concerned, recent theoretical models have shown that productivity gains associated
with offshoring and GVCs may accrue from the finer international division of labor, which is
isomorphic to factor-augmenting technical change (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2007), as well
as from increased competition, greater diversity in input varieties, learning externalities and
technology spillovers (Li and Liu 2012; Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud 2014).


Empirical research in support of the theoretical predictions linking GVCs to productivity is
limited. Contributions include older strands of work focusing on benefits to countries that initiate
offshoring (Feenstra and Hanson 1996; Egger and Egger 2006; Amiti and Wei 2009; Winkler
2010), but also recent efforts that analyze the impact of vertical specialization on countries
participating in GVCs (Formai and Vergara Caffarelli 2016, Kummritz 2016, Taglioni and
Winkler 2016). 


We empirically investigate the link between GVC participation and productivity. Results based
on a panel estimation covering 13 sectors in 40 countries over 15 years suggest that participation
in GVCs is a significant driver of labor productivity. In our preferred specification, an increase
by 10 percent in the level of GVC participation increased average productivity by 1.7 percent.
We also perform a number of robustness tests. Interestingly, while trade that is not-GVC related
also has a positive impact on productivity, we find that this relationship is less robust.

  Recent studies by Haugh et al. (2016), Al-Haschimi et al. (2016), and Timmer et al. (2016) confirm this earlier
finding. IMF (2016) finds that structural factors account for a quarter of the current global trade slowdown.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and our empirical
strategy. Regression results and robustness tests are discussed in Section 3. Concluding remarks
follow.




       2. Data and empirical strategy
We begin by inspecting whether manufacturing data by country and year reveal a link between
labor productivity and GVCs. Labor productivity is computed as real value added divided by
number of persons employed. Vertical specialization in manufacturing is defined as the sum of
the foreign value added embodied in exports (backward linkages) and the domestic value added
in exports that the direct importer exports further or that returns home as imports (forward
linkages). The data (figure 3), indicate a positive association between growth in real labor
productivity per employee in manufacturing by country and year, and growth in vertical
specialization.

Although suggestive, the correlation in figure 3 does not demonstrate a causal relationship.
Therefore, we provide a more formal econometric analysis of this relationship. The econometric
estimation relies on a production function that expresses value added VAc,s,t of industry s in
country c and year t as a function of capital, Kc,s,t,, labor, Lc,s,t, and a technology shifter Ac,s,t (Eq.
1). The latter is driven in part by a range of trade-related determinants (θ1, θ2,…, θn), that capture
both traditional trade and trade occurring in a GVC context.

Dividing by Lc,s,t taking logs, and adding fixed effects yields the following reduced form:


            ln             , ,                      ∗ ln       /    , ,   ∑        ∗ ln	      , , ,   ,   ,   ,   , ,

Labor productivity - computed as real value added divided by employment - and the real capital
stock per employee are denoted by LP and K, respectively. The effects of trade and participation
in GVCs on labor productivity are unlikely to be instantaneous. We capture this idea by lagging
the trade-related variables, an approach that may also help alleviate concerns of endogeneity due
to reverse causality. A range of unobserved determinants, such as, for instance, labor market
reforms, global technology shocks, and time-invariant technology differences across countries
and industries, are captured by three types of fixed effects (FE): country-industry, country-year
and industry-year.


The two main sources of the data are the World Input-Output Database (WIOD 2013) and WIOD
Socio-Economic accounts (Timmer et al. 2015). WIOD covers 40 countries, 35 sectors (ISIC
rev. 3) and 17 years (1995-2011). 4 Estimations are based on a subsample of 13 manufacturing
industries, and span 1995 to 2009 because missing real capital stock caused 2010 and 2011 to be

  WIOD updates for the input-output table data have been posted online (as WIOD 2016). They cover three
additional countries, period 2000-2014 and ISIC rev.4 industries. However, data on employment, capital stocks and
price deflators by industry are not available. Employment and capital flow data from UNIDO extend up to 2013, but
the coverage is uneven especially in the recent years.

                                                                              6 
 
 
 

dropped from the sample.5 All trade related measures are deflated to eliminate price effects. We
focused the analysis on the productivity of manufacturing industries, because these are more
GVC intensive. The fact that the participation of services industries in GVCs is more difficult to
quantify fully further motivated their exclusion.


To capture vertical specialization, we consider two conventionally used indicators, computed by
applying the Leontief’s approach to synthetically derived international input-output tables
(Hummels, Ishi and Yi 2001; Koopman, Wang, and Wei 2014). The first indicator measures the
extent of backward participation in GVCs and consists of the foreign value added embodied in
gross exports. The second indicator measures the forward participation in GVCs, and includes
the domestic value added embodied in gross exports that direct importers export further or that
returns home as imports.


       3. Results and robustness tests
Equation (2) is estimated sequentially, as we explore several measures of the trade-related
determinants of the technology shifter Ac,s,t. We start from trade indicators of broad scope and
work our way towards specifications that allow for greater focus on the GVC-related trade.
While this approach provides an overall perspective of the trade-productivity nexus, it is
ultimately intended to minimize the problem of omitted variables in the regressions. Results are
provided in columns 1 through 3 of table 1.


As reported in column 1 of table 1, labor productivity is significantly associated with both
imports and exports of goods and services. This result is consistent with the literature, which
identifies multiple routes through which trade affects productivity: enhanced competition
through imports at the same stage of production, greater access to better-quality or more-diverse
imported inputs (eg. Amiti and Konings 2007; Goldberg et al. 2010), as well as through learning
by exporting (De Loecker 2013).

    concerns the per capita income level (col. 5). F-statistics exceed the Stock-Yogo (2005) critical values in all cases. In column (6), the allocation of imports to industries is
    based on WIOD-derived proportionality coefficients, averaged across 1995-2011.

Next, we split imports and exports by the type of goods and services. The results reported in
column 2 of table 1 highlight the relative importance of the imported input channel. A 10 percent
increase in the level of imports of intermediates increases labor productivity by 2 percent.6
Coefficients of other types of trade are not significant or weakly significant.7


Finally, we dig deeper into the relationship between intermediate imports and labor productivity,
by separating GVC-related imported inputs from non-GVC related imported inputs.8 As
discussed, the proxy for GVC-related imports of inputs is the foreign value added embodied in
exports, the conventional measure of backward vertical specialization. For imports that are not
related to GVCs, we use the foreign value added absorbed domestically. Results presented in
column 3 of table 1 suggest that imported inputs matter for productivity whether or not they are
related to GVCs, with the two coefficients comparable in magnitude. Specifically, a 10 percent
increase in the level of GVC-related or non-GVC-related imports of intermediates increases
labor productivity by 0.8 percent.


These findings suggest that GVCs in particular, and trade more broadly, play a role in boosting
productivity. However, our efforts to control for omitted variables (through the inclusion of a
battery of fixed effects and non-GVC related components of trade) and to deal with reverse
causality (by using lagged independent variables) may be insufficient to eradicate all causes of
bias in the coefficients of the vertical specialization measures. We attempt to address concerns
relating to reverse causality, omitted variables and measurement errors in a series of robustness
tests.


First, we use an instrumental variable technique to address the possibility that reverse causality is
biasing the coefficient of backward vertical specialization. The approach is based on the work of
Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez (2015) who argue that there is a technological asymmetry in the

                                                            
6
  The magnitude of the effect is the result of averaging across countries and sectors that vary widely in their
propensity to import intermediates. These compositional aspects may explain why country-specific and firm-level
studies typically find larger effects (Amiti and Konings 2007; Blaum, Lelarge and Peters 2014).
7
  The lack of significance of final goods imports and exports of intermediates may result from multicollinearity-
because imports of intermediates embodied in exports are included in the import and export covariates.
8
  Including export variables in this specification leads to instability in the backward vertical specialization indicator
(INT_IMP_GVC) due to multicollinearity. The same problem affects the identification of the forward vertical
specialization indicator, even in regressions that focus on exports components only. 

                                                               9 
 
 
 

international production networks between “headquarter” and “factory” economies. Headquarter
economies (the United States, Germany and Japan) are the main providers of intermediates
essential to exporting and arrange the production networks. Factory economies provide the
labor. Specifically, Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez (2015) find that the headquarter-versus-
factory-economy distinction emerges clearly when they analyze the data on backward
specialization, which they refer to as “import to export” (or I2E).


Based on this finding, for each country c, industry s and year t, the instrument is computed as the
average foreign value added from the United States, Japan and Germany embodied in exports of
industry s of three countries in the sample that are closest geographically or in income to country
c.9 The underlying assumption is that technological developments in these three countries (i.e.
the information and communication technology revolution) and declining trade costs globally
were the main drivers of GVC expansion.10 The instrument is positively and significantly
correlated with the backward vertical specialization measure and standard tests rule out its
weakness.11


The results in columns 4 and 5 point to a significant effect of the foreign value added embodied
in exports on labor productivity.12 Focusing on the specification reported in column (5), which
may more effectively address any endogeneity problem than the one in column (4) (see footnote
11), a 10 percent increase in the level of GVC-related trade is associated with an increase in
labor productivity of 1.7 percentage points. The impact of GVC-trade on labor productivity is
somewhat larger than that of non-GVC trade.

  Distance data are from CEPII, and per capita PPP income from the International Monetary Fund World Economic
Outlook.
10
   Our identification strategy is similar to the approach used in Autor, Dorn and Hanson. (2013) who instrument the
import growth in the United States from China with the Chinese import growth in other high-income markets.
11
   There is a small risk that this instrument violates the exclusion restriction because the expansion of GVCs into
neighboring countries might be at the expense of the participation of the country in question, or there may be
spillovers from productivity benefits from expansion of GVCs into neighboring countries. The first effect would in
fact work against finding a positive relationship, while the second could lead to a biased estimate. Even though we
doubt the significance of the second channel, we attempted to address this concern by defining neighborhood not
just in geographical terms, but also in income terms.
12
   Industry-year fixed effects tend to absorb the variation in our instrument in the second stage regressions, and are
therefore excluded from the IV estimation.13 Country imports are assigned to industries based on WIOD-based
simplified coefficients of proportionality. Like the conventional indicator, the alternative one is deflated using
WIOD price deflators.

                                                               10 
 
 
 


Second, to deal with the problem of omitted variables, we run alternative regressions to those
presented in column 3, using a differenced dependent variable as well as the standard covariates.
This specification is more demanding than the one in levels because it deals with time-invariant
country-industry heterogeneity in two ways. The first control is implicit and it is due to the fact
that differencing itself wipes out the impact of potential country-industry omitted variables such
as technology differences across countries, industries, or country-industry pairs. The second
control is explicit, in the form of the country-industry fixed effects, and captures the fact that
some country-industry pairs are more dynamic participants in GVCs or exhibit higher technical
progress than others throughout the period of analysis (Amiti and Wei 2009). In the results
presented in column 6, only imports associated with vertical specialization are significant.
Specifically, an acceleration in the pace of the backward vertical specialization by 10 percentage
points increases the average productivity growth by close to half a percentage point.


Finally, we try to address two sources of measurement error associated with the conventional
vertical specialization measures: the application of Leontief’s methodology to estimate value
added in all production stages, and the extrapolation techniques used to obtain input-output
tables in years with no data. Using real trade data from WITS and the formulation in Hummels,
Ishii and Yi (2001, page 78), we construct an alternative measure of backward vertical
specialization in manufacturing industries, that essentially captures - for industry s in country c -
the foreign content of directly imported inputs embodied in exported output.13 We use the
alternative indicator in place of the conventional backward vertical specialization measure in the
difference specification presented in column 6. The results reported in column 7 support the
original conclusion that growth in GVC-related trade and growth in labor productivity are
positively and significantly associated.


       4. Conclusion
This note provides evidence that global value chains boost productivity. While there are many
other factors that determine the rate of productivity growth, this evidence suggests that the

                                                            
13
  Country imports are assigned to industries based on WIOD-based simplified coefficients of proportionality. Like
the conventional indicator, the alternative one is deflated using WIOD price deflators.

                                                               11 
 
 
 

slower pace of GVC expansion is also contributing to the slower growth of world productivity.
Data constraints have limited the scope of this exercise, especially in terms of the countries
covered. Improvements in data would help to determine the broader validity of these
conclusions. Beyond establishing the relative importance of backward participation in GVCs –
i.e., the reliance on imported inputs to produce for exports - the analysis has also not fully
illuminated the channels through which GVCs contribute to enhanced productivity.
Understanding these channels, as well as how policy can either inhibit or encourage them, is an
important area for future research.
