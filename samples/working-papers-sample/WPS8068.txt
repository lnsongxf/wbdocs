  1. Introduction

This paper presents estimates of the relationship between the share of income held by the middle

class and economic growth of ASEAN economies. As such, the paper is part of a literature in

macroeconomics that examines the relationship between income inequality and aggregate output of

countries; see Galor (2011) for a review. At least since Kuznet (1955), it has been noted that the

relationship between income inequality and GDP per capita may be non-linear. Galor and Zeira

(1993) provide a model that generates such an inverted U-shaped relationship between income

inequality and GDP per capita. In their model, a bi-directional causality between income

distribution and GDP per capita emerges: (i) an increase in GDP per capita reduces income

inequality; (ii) the effect of an increase in income inequality on GDP per capita is positive for

relatively poor countries and negative for relatively rich countries. In the Galor and Zeira (1993)

model, the mechanism that generates the non-linear effect of income inequality on GDP per capita

is human capital accumulation: With credit market imperfections and fixed costs of human capital

accumulation, an increase in income inequality increases investment in human capital in relatively

poor countries; but the opposite is the case in relatively rich countries.

       The first part of this paper presents effects that economic growth during 1970-2010 had on

changes of ASEAN countries' shares of income accruing to the third and fourth quintiles. Brueckner

et al. (2015) used international oil price shocks and trade-weighted world income of countries as

instruments to estimate the effect that exogenous variation in GDP per capita has on various

measures of countries' income inequality. Using these estimates and data on changes of ASEAN

countries' GDP per capita between 1970 and 2010, this paper computes predicted effects that GDP

per capita growth during 1970-2010 had on changes in the income share accruing to the middle

class of ASEAN countries. The main finding is that the middle class gained substantially from

economic growth over the past four decades: the share of income accruing to the 3rd (4th) quintile

increased for the average ASEAN country by around 6 (8) percentage points due to growth in



                                                    2
average incomes during that period.

        In the second part of the paper, we present predictions of the effects that changes in income

inequality have on ASEAN countries' GDP per capita growth. These predicted effects are computed

by combining estimates of the non-linear effect that a change in income inequality has on GDP per

capita growth and data on ASEAN countries' initial GDP per capita. Brueckner and Lederman

(2015) provide instrumental variables estimates of the effect that an exogenous change in income

inequality has on GDP per capita growth. This paper draws on the estimates presented in that paper.

        One of the main findings in this paper is that for the majority of ASEAN countries a rise of

the middle class would have had a negative effect on economic growth if it would have occurred at

an early stage of economic development, as measured by levels of GDP per capita in 1970. ASEAN

economies' average income was too low in 1970 for a rise of the middle class to have generated a

positive effect on economic growth. In contrast, for current values of average income a rise of the

middle class has a positive effect on economic growth in all the ASEAN countries.

        Consistent with the Galor and Zeira (1993) model, the paper documents that human capital

accumulation is an important mechanism through which the rise of the middle class affects

economic growth in ASEAN. At the early stage of development, as measured by 1970 levels of

GDP per capita, an increase of the share of income held by the middle class would have had a

negative effect on the share of the population with secondary and tertiary education in ASEAN

countries. But for recent levels of ASEAN countries' GDP per capita the opposite is the case: An

increase in the share of income held by the middle class would increase the share of the population

with secondary and tertiary education. Borrowing constraints in investment in human capital1 may

explain the existence of this non-linear relationship between income inequality, economic growth,

and education; see the model of Galor and Zeira (1993).

2. Results

2.1 Effect of Economic Growth on the Rise of the Middle Class

Table 1 shows predictions of the country-specific effects that changes in the natural logarithm of

GDP per capita between 1970 and 2010 had on the income shares of the 3rd and 4th quintiles in

ASEAN countries. To generate these numbers, one first needs an estimate of the causal effect that

GDP per capita has on the income share of the 3rd and 4th quintiles. Brueckner et al. (2015) provide

such an estimate. For a panel of 104 countries spanning the period 1970-2010, they use oil price

shocks and trade-weighted world income as an instrument for GDP per capita. Their panel fixed

effects estimates show that exogenous increases in GDP per capita have a significant positive effect

on the income share of the 3rd and 4th quintiles.2 The relevant equation is:

(1)               Inequalityct = ec + ft + αln(GDP p.c.)ct + εit

From the estimates provided in Brueckner et al. (2015), we can compute the effect that changes in

the natural logarithm of GDP per capita between 1970 and 2010 had on the income shares of the 3rd

and 4th quintiles of ASEAN countries. Specifically, this is done by multiplying the coefficients

reported in columns (4) and (5) of Table 1 in Brueckner et al. (2015) with the changes of ASEAN

countries' natural logarithms of GDP per capita between 1970 and 2010.3 Data on GDP per capita

are from the Penn World Table (Heston et al., 2012).

         From Table 1, one can see that economic growth of ASEAN countries between 1970 and

2010 had a substantial impact on the share of income accruing to the middle class. In column (1) a

measure of the middle class is the income share of the 3rd quintile. In column (2) a measure of the

upper middle class is the income share of the 4th quintile. For the average (median) ASEAN

country, growth in GDP per capita between 1970 and 2010 increased the income share of the 3rd

quintile by around 5.7 (6.2) percentage points. The effect on the 4th quintile is slightly larger, around

7 percentage points.

2 Brueckner et al. (2015) do not find a significant non-linear effect of national income, i.e. [ln(GDP p.c.)]2, on the
  income shares.
3 This follows from totally differentiating equation (1): Δinequalityct = αΔln(GDP p.c.)ct.

                                                            4
        The ASEAN country with the highest GDP per capita growth rate during 1970-2010 was

Singapore. According to Table 1, the income share of the 3rd (4th) quintile was boosted in Singapore

due to rapid GDP per capita growth during that period by around 7 (9) percentage points. In

contrast, the ASEAN country with the lowest GDP per capita growth rate during 1970-2010 was

Brunei. Growth of Brunei's GDP per capita during 1970-2010 increased the income share of the 3rd

(4th) quintile by around 3 (4) percentage points.



2.2. Effect of the Rise of the Middle Class on Economic Growth

Brueckner and Lederman (2015) present instrumental variables estimates of the impact that various

measures of income inequality have on GDP per capita. The authors use the residual variation in

income inequality, ε, that is not due to GDP per capita as an instrument to estimate effects that

exogenous variation in income inequality have on GDP per capita.4 The relevant equation is:

(2)              ln(GDP p.c.)ct = ac + bt + θ1Inequalityct + θ2Inequalityct*ln(initial GDP p.c.)c + uct

Brueckner and Lederman (2015) find that the effect of inequality on GDP per capita differs

depending on countries' initial level of GDP per capita. The estimates that these authors provide are

useful for computing effects that a rise of the middle class has on GDP per capita of ASEAN

economies at different stages of these countries' economic development.

        Table 2 reports predicted effects of a 1 percentage point increase in the income share of the

3rd quintile on GDP per capita of ASEAN countries. Column (1) reports predicted effects based on

ASEAN countries' initial economic development as measured by GDP per capita in 1970; column

(2) reports effects for recent levels of economic development as measured by GDP per capita in

2010. Specifically, for column (1) the predicted effects are generated by combining estimates

reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) (see their column (4) of Table 1), with the values of

countries' GDP per capita in 1970. For column (2) the predicted effects are generated by combining

4 To do this, one needs a consistent estimate of α in equation (1). This estimate is obtained from Brueckner et al.
  (2015). For papers that have applied such an instrumental variables strategy in the context of foreign aid and fiscal
  policy, see, for example, Brueckner (2013) and Fatas and Mihov (2001).

                                                           5
estimates reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) (see their column (4) of Table 1), with the

values of countries' GDP per capita in 2010. Brueckner and Lederman's estimated relationship for

country c and period t is:

(3)             ln(GDP per capita)ct = -243*Q3ct + 37*Q3ct*ln(initial GDP per capita)c

where Q3 is the income share of the 3rd quintile.

       From column (1) of Table 2, one can see that a rise of the middle class would have had a

significant negative effect on GDP per capita for the majority of ASEAN countries if it would have

occurred at an early stage of economic development as measured by GDP per capita in 1970. For

the average (median) ASEAN country, a one percentage point increase in the income share held by

the 3rd quintile would have reduced GDP per capita by around 0.15 (0.18) logs. Figure 1 displays in

the form of a bar plot the information shown in column (1) of Table 2. The bar plot visualizes the

heterogeneity across ASEAN countries: at 1970 levels of GDP per capita, a one percentage point

increase in the share of income held by the 3rd quintile would have had a large negative effect in

Vietnam, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and Indonesia; a moderate negative effect in

Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia; a moderate positive effect in Singapore; and a

large positive effect in Brunei.

       Column (2) of Table 2 shows that for 2010 levels of GDP per capita, an increase in the

income share held by the 3rd quintile has a significant positive effect on GDP per capita in all the

ASEAN countries. A one percentage point increase in the income share held by the 3rd quintile

increases GDP per capita by over 0.7 (0.9) logs in the average (median) ASEAN country. Brunei

and Singapore are at the top end with gains in GDP per capita of over 1.7 logs. In Malaysia, the

effect is around 1.2 logs. More modest gains in GDP per capita would be realized in the remainder

of the ASEAN countries. But even at the bottom end, a one percentage point increase in the income

share held by the 3rd quintile would increase GDP per capita by around 0.5 log. A graphical

illustration of these effects is provided in Figure 2.

       Table 3 presents results for the income share accruing to the 4th quintile. Column (1) reports

effects for an early stage of economic development as measured by GDP per capita in 1970; column

(2) reports effects for a recent stage of economic development as measured by GDP per capita in

2010. Specifically, for column (1) the predicted effects are generated by combining estimates

reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) (see their column (5) of Table 1), with the values of

countries' GDP per capita in 1970. For column (2) the predicted effects are generated by combining

estimates reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) (see their column (5) of Table 1), with the

values of countries' GDP per capita in 2010. Brueckner and Lederman's estimated relationship for

country c and period t is:

(4)             ln(GDP per capita)ct = -263*Q4ct + 40*Q4ct*ln(initial GDP per capita)c

where Q4 is the income share of the 4th quintile.

       From column (1) of Table 3, one sees that a rise of the upper middle class would have had a

significant negative effect on GDP per capita for the majority of ASEAN countries for levels of

GDP per capita in 1970. Specifically, for the average (median) ASEAN country, a one percentage

point increase in the income share held by the fourth quintile would have decreased GDP per capita

by around 0.2 (0.2) log. In contrast, for current levels of GDP per capita, a rise of the upper middle

class would have a significant positive effect on aggregate output in all the ASEAN countries. This

is shown in column (2) of Table 3. For 2010 levels of GDP per capita, a one percentage point

increase in the income share held by the fourth quintile would increase GDP per capita by around

0.9 (0.7) log in the average (median) ASEAN country.

       Tables 4 reports results for the net (i.e. after tax and transfers) Gini. The predicted effects

reported there are generated based on the following estimates of Brueckner and Lederman (2015):

(5)    ln(GDP per capita)ct = 90*NetGinict – 13*NetGinict*ln(initial GDP per capita)c

From column (1) of Table 4, one sees that a decrease in income inequality after tax and transfers

would have had a significant negative effect on GDP per capita for the majority of ASEAN



                                                    7
countries for levels of GDP per capita in 1970. Specifically, for the average (median) ASEAN

country a one percentage point decrease in the net Gini would have decreased GDP per capita by

around 0.1 (0.1) log. In contrast, for current levels of GDP per capita a decrease in the net Gini

would have a positive effect on aggregate output in all the ASEAN countries. This is shown in

column (2) of Table 4. For 2010 levels of GDP per capita, a one percentage point decrease in the net

Gini would increase GDP per capita by around 0.6 (0.4) log in the average (median) ASEAN

country.

       Table 5 shows that similar results are obtained for the market Gini. The predicted effects

reported in Table 5 are generated based on the following estimates of Brueckner and Lederman

(2015):

(6)    ln(GDP per capita)ct = 90*MarketGinict – 13*MarketGinict*ln(initial GDP per capita)c

From column (1) of Table 5, one sees that a decrease in market income inequality would have had a

negative effect on GDP per capita for the majority of ASEAN countries for levels of GDP per capita

in 1970. For the average (median) ASEAN country, a one percentage point decrease in the market

Gini would have decreased GDP per capita by around 0.1 (0.1) log. In contrast, for current levels of

GDP per capita, a decrease in the net Gini would have a positive effect on aggregate output in all

the ASEAN countries. This is shown in column (2) of Table 5. For 2010 levels of GDP per capita, a

one percentage point decrease in the net Gini would increase GDP per capita by around 0.3 (0.2) log

in the average (median) ASEAN country.

       In the Galor and Zeira (1993) model, the mechanism through which income inequality

affects aggregate output is human capital accumulation.        In the presence of credit market

imperfections and fixed costs, only sufficiently rich individuals are able to accumulate human

capital. That is why in poor countries a decrease in inequality reduces human capital accumulation;

the opposite is the case in relatively rich countries.

       We provide evidence that the human capital accumulation mechanism is present in the



                                                    8
sample of ASEAN countries in Tables 6 and 7. Table 6 provides estimates of the predicted effects

that a one percentage point increase in the income share held by the 3rd quintile has on the share of

the population with secondary education. Table 7 provides estimates of the predicted effects that a

one percentage point increase in the income share held by the 3rd quintile has on the share of

population with tertiary education. The predicted effects are computed based on the following

estimated relationships in Brueckner and Lederman (2015):

(7)    (Share of Population Secondary Schooling)ct = -9.6*Q3ct +1.5*Q3ct*ln(initial GDP p.c.)c

(8)     (Share of Population Tertiary Education)ct = -5.0*Q3ct +0.8*Q3ct*ln(initial GDP p.c.)c

For columns (1) and (2) of Tables 6 and 7, the predicted effects are generated by combining the

above estimates with the values of countries' GDP per capita in 1970 and 2010, respectively.

       From column (1) of Tables 6 and 7, one sees that a rise of the middle class would have had a

negative effect on human capital accumulation for the majority of ASEAN countries for levels of

GDP per capita in 1970. This is true regardless of whether the measure of human capital

accumulation is the share of population with secondary education or tertiary education. For the

average ASEAN country, a one percentage point increase in the income share held by the third

quintile would have decreased the share of population with secondary (tertiary) education by around

0.3 (0.4) percentage point. In contrast, for recent levels of GDP per capita, a rise of the middle class

would have a significant positive effect on human capital accumulation in all the ASEAN countries.

This is shown in column (2) of Tables 6 and 7. For 2010 levels of GDP per capita, a one percentage

point increase in the income share held by the third quintile would increase the share of population

with secondary (tertiary) education by around 4.1 (1.8) percentage points in the average ASEAN

country.

       Table 8 reports effects on the investment-to-GDP ratio. For column (1) the predicted effects

are generated by combining estimates reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) with the values

of countries' GDP per capita in 1970. For column (2) the predicted effects are generated by



                                                   9
combining estimates reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) with the values of countries' GDP

per capita in 2010. Specifically, the estimated relationship for country c and period t is:

       INV/GDPct = -26*Q3ct +4*Q3ct*ln(initial GDP per capita)c

Column (1) of Table 8 shows that an increase in the income share of the 3rd quintile has a negative

effect on the investment-to-GDP ratio for the majority of ASEAN countries for 1970 levels of GDP

per capita. From column (2) of Table 8, one sees that for 2010 levels of GDP per capita the effects

are positive for all ASEAN countries.



3. Summary

This paper provided estimates of the relationship between the rise of the middle class and economic

growth in ASEAN countries. At early stages of economic development (as measured by GDP per

capita in 1970), a rise of the middle class would have decreased GDP per capita growth in ASEAN.

However, for current levels of GDP per capita, a rise of the middle class increases growth. The

paper documented that human capital accumulation, measured by the share of the population with

secondary and tertiary education, is an important mechanism through which changes in the income

share held by the middle class affect economic growth.

Note: The table reports effects on log GDP per capita of a 1 percentage point decrease in the market Gini. For column
(1) the predicted effects are generated by combining estimates reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) with the
values of countries' GDP per capita in 1970. For column (2) the predicted effects are generated by combining estimates
reported in Brueckner and Lederman (2015) with the values of countries' GDP per capita in 2010. Specifically, the
estimated relationship for country c and period t is ln(GDP per capita)ct = 90*MarketGinict – 13*MarketGinict*ln(initial
GDP per capita)c.
