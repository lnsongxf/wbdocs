                                    I.    INTRODUCTION

    Children living in poverty are exposed to a wide range of negative influences, such as poor
housing, inadequate nutrition, parental stress, and lack of cognitive stimulation (Walker et al.
2011). Additionally, these children are often exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously and
repeatedly over time (Najman et al. 2009). There is consistent evidence of socioeconomic gradients
for child health outcomes in both high-income countries (Case et al. 2002; Currie 2009; Shonkoff
et al. 2009) and low- to middle-income countries (Currie and Vogl 2013; Petrou and Kupek 2010).
    Low socioeconomic status (SES) is also a risk factor for poor child development outcomes
(e.g., language, cognition, and behavior), and children of parents with less income or education
perform worse than children whose parents have more income or education (Cunha and Heckman
2008; Kelly et al. 2011), according to studies from high-income countries. There is evidence of
socioeconomic gradients in child development outcomes from lower and middle-income countries
as well, but existing data are primarily cross-sectional. For example, wealth gradients in child
development scores are evident as early as 3–23 months in India, Indonesia, Peru, and Senegal
(Fernald et al. 2012). Preschool children (3–6 years old) exhibit significant gaps in receptive
language in Ecuador (Paxson and Schady 2007), several other Latin American countries (Schady
et al. 2015), and the four countries of the Young Lives Study (Engle et al. 2011). Unfortunately,
these studies are limited by the lack of panel data with repeated measures of child development
outcomes across critical and sensitive periods. Cross-sectional studies cannot untangle issues of
timing where age effects are confounded with cohort effects and where the role of early skills on
later development cannot be modeled. With few exceptions (e.g., [Kobrosly et al. 2011]) and the
Young Lives cohorts, longitudinal panels have primarily been focused in the US and Europe.
    This paper is one of the few examples of a longitudinal cohort study set in a very low-income
country in Sub-Saharan Africa that has assessed children with direct measures of cognitive
development at two points in time: early childhood (3–6 years) and school age (7–10 years). The
cohort was also evaluated with early math and literacy measures at school age. Previous work
demonstrated that these same children showed significant differences across socioeconomic status
in standardized scores for a wide range of cognitive and language tests; the largest gaps in the SES
gradient were evident in receptive language and sustained attention scores (Fernald et al. 2011).
    The primary objective of this paper is to take advantage of these longitudinal data and examine
how the magnitude and age profile of SES gradients change over time, modeling skill formation
as a cumulative and dynamic process. Differences in child development are assessed across wealth
groups, and the evolution of the SES gradient across early childhood and into school age is
documented. While other papers based on cross-sectional evidence have already documented that
the SES gradient widens at early ages and then flattens out after age six during the school-age
window (Schady 2011), this study relies on both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal aspect of
the data to document the critical timing of the emergence and evolution of the SES differences in
child development and learning outcomes.
    We further add to the literature by assessing the magnitude of the SES gradients across multiple
developmental domains. Much of the current focus on children living in resource-poor
circumstances is on height, weight, or morbidity outcomes or on a single dimension of child
development (such as receptive language). In this study, multiple domains of child development
are examined, including measures of cognition, language, and executive function, to examine
whether the magnitude and evolution of SES gradients differ across domains. There is evidence
that certain regions of the brain may be differentially vulnerable to the effects of SES (Hackman
and Farah 2009), particularly language (Noble et al. 2007) and executive function (Farah et al.
2006). Our results show that receptive vocabulary and sustained attention exhibit the largest
gradients after the inclusion of lagged outcomes, maternal endowments (education and
vocabulary), and home environment. These outcomes also exhibit a steeper widening of the
gradient with age, in contrast to the other outcomes.
    Next, we assess how much of the wealth gap in child development outcomes could be
accounted for by household inputs such as home stimulation. Home stimulation as measured at the
time of school age is shown to account for 12-18% of the wealth gap in z-scores across the various
domains with the largest findings for receptive vocabulary and memory of phrases, which is a
verbal measure of working memory. The estimate represents a lower bound on the role of the home
environment as it does not account for the role of lagged home inputs on developmental outcomes.
    Finally, the mapping of different domains of child outcomes onto learning outcomes in math
and early literacy at school age is documented. The magnitudes of the gap for school learning
outcomes are found to map closely with those obtained using our contemporaneous developmental
outcomes (sustained attention, receptive vocabulary, and cognitive composite).
    The remainder of the paper documents the data and outcomes being studied (section 1),
outlines the empirical methods (section 2), describes the results (section 3), and conclusions
(section 4).

                                                                    II.   DATA

This analysis draws from a nationally representative survey of nutrition and child development in
Madagascar (Enquete Anthropometrique et de Developpement de l’Enfant) that was first
administered in 2004. A random subsample of 150 of the original 446 communities representative
of all rural and urban areas, excluding the largest urban cities, was drawn for this longitudinal
study. About 1,500 children who were ages zero to three years in 2004 were identified for a
prospective cohort from these communities (Galasso and Umapathi 2007). Children’s
development in multiple domains (including cognitive, language, and executive function) was
assessed at two follow-up periods, 2007 and 2011, when the children were three to six years
(preschool age) and seven to ten years of age (primary school age). If children changed residence
between surveys, they were tracked to different households or villages.

                                                               Child Development Tests

The assessments used in this study were specifically selected to focus on the domains that have
been shown to be neurologically correlated with poverty or sensitive to nutrition interventions.
The choices of which specific tests to use for each domain were based on the adaptability of the
tests to the social and cultural realities of Malagasy children and on the practical aspects of their
use given the constraints of the investigation (e.g., length of test, sample size, cost and cultural
acceptability of materials, and supervision required) (Fernald et al. 2010).
    A battery of six cognitive and language tests was administered both in 2007 (Fernald et al.
2011) and 20111; more detail is provided in appendix S1 (figure S.1 in the supplemental appendix).
                                                            
1. Essential adaptations to the assessment tools were made during the initial development of the battery of tests,
followed by adjustments and improvements based on pretest results from the field. No questions were eliminated from
any of the child development measures. All instructions and words or phrases were translated into Malagasy and then
Three subscales of the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales (visual-spatial processing, working
memory, and fluid reasoning) were combined to estimate children’s non-verbal cognitive ability.
The Leiter test was used to evaluate the capacity to maintain attention, which has been identified
as a critical metric of school readiness and is an important component of executive function
(Duncan et al. 2007). The Woodcock Muñoz (WM) memory of phrases test requires children to
repeat words and sentences with an increasing order of difficulty; it is also considered a measure
of working memory, which is a component of executive function. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test (PPVT-III) is a test of receptive vocabulary knowledge and was administered to the children
and their primary caregivers.
    Z-scores were calculated for each of the above tests from two-month, age-specific means and
standard deviations in each age category.

                                                           Learning Tests and Child Enrollment

In addition to the measures of cognitive and language development, two tests of learning outcomes
were incorporated when children were school age in 2011: one for mathematics and the other for
early literacy skills. The tests were adaptations of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA)
(Gove and Wettenberg 2011) and the Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) (Rubens
2009) instruments developed by USAID and widely used in other French-speaking African
countries. The literacy test ranged from basic assessment of auditory comprehension, recognition
of letters and key basic words, to more complex ability of reading and comprehension of a text.
The mathematics test includes basic number identification, comparison of numbers, basic
arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and word problems involving
addition and subtraction. After translation, the Malagasy versions of these tests were
systematically and rigorously pretested and were found to be informative even among children
who had not attended school. For example, many children knew how to count and answer the
simplest word problems even if they had not attended formal schooling. Short stories that were
part of the original test were rewritten during the pretesting phase so that questions associated with
auditory comprehension would be accessible to children who were illiterate.

                                                    SES and Sociodemographic Characteristics

The key proxy of SES used in the analyses is a household wealth index in 2004 when children
were 0–3 years, divided into quintiles. The index was constructed using principal component
analysis of key durables, assets and dwelling conditions2 (Filmer and Pritchett 2001). This SES
proxy is less likely to suffer from the concern about measurement error that generally affects
income variables. Furthermore, an index for wealth is often used in the analysis of SES gradients
in child outcomes in both developed and developing country contexts, and commonly adopted in
descriptive analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys. As described in greater detail below, a
full set of dummy variables for wealth quintiles were included in our regressions, and the results
                                                            
translated back into English to ensure linguistic and functional equivalence. More information on each child test is
available in appendix 1.
     2. The wealth index is the first principal component of the following variables: walls, floors, roof, home
ownership, whether the toilette is shared, whether household has access to safe water, ownership of chairs, phone,
motor vehicle, cattle ownership, and poultry ownership. The sample is representative of rural and small urban villages
(excluding large cities in all regions and the capital).
included in appendices. In the key summary tables, however, estimates are presented contrasting
the wealthiest, or fifth, quintile with the poorest, or first, quintile. Household density (or crowding)
is also included not as a direct proxy for SES, but as an additional regressor, documented to be an
environmental stressor and important determinant of child wellbeing (Evans 2004).

                                                                   Child Nutritional Status

Two measures of nutritional outcomes are included: birth weight (to reflect nutrition during
gestation) and height-for-age z-score, HAZ (to reflect early childhood nutrition). For children with
recorded birth weight information (48%), actual birth weight was highly correlated with maternal
report of perceived birth weight (r=0.60, p<0.001), suggesting that perceived birth weight is a
reasonable proxy for actual recorded birth weight.3 Thus, perceived birth weight was included in
the regressions (binary indicator variable for perceived “low” or “very low” birth weight relative
to “normal,” “high,” or “very high”). Significant associations exist between low height-for-age
(stunting) and delayed cognitive development, psychomotor development, behavior, and later
success in school (Grantham-McGregor et al. 2007). In Madagascar, the prevalence of stunting
among children was 58% at our first measurement when children were 0–3 years.4

                                                               Maternal Education and Endowments

Maternal education is expressed with indicators of completed primary or secondary education. In
addition, maternal height and maternal receptive vocabulary are included as proxies for maternal
ability. Maternal height is an important proxy for maternal cognitive development (Case and
Paxson 2008) and represents a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of economic
status since it represents maternal genetic endowment in addition to her own prenatal and
childhood exposure. Children born to mothers who are shorter are more likely to have lower birth
weight/length and higher neonatal mortality than those born to taller mothers (Bhalotra and
Rawlings 2013). To measure maternal receptive vocabulary, the same test used for children was
used for mothers, the PPVT-III. Maternal vocabulary ability was estimated using item-response
theory (IRT) to ensure a common metric for the variable across the sample (Masters and Wright
1984).

                                                                      Parenting Inputs

To measure parenting inputs, an adaptation of the Home Observation for Measurement of the
Environment Inventory (HOME) for Middle Childhood (MC) in 2011 was administered. The
adapted HOME scale captures learning environments which represent key pathways through
which poverty can affect school readiness; the HOME scale captures both risk factors that increase
vulnerability (e.g., harsh parental punishment, lack of sensitive parenting, limited books or toys in
the home) as well as buffering factors that can help children thrive in spite of poverty (e.g.,
exposure to responsive parenting, presence of books and toys in the home) (Blair and Raver 2012;

                                                            
    3. Children whose mothers assessed their weight as small, and children with low measured weight have been
shown to be significantly less likely to survive than are children who weigh more at birth (Alderman et al. 2011).
    4. The prevalence of stunting in our sample is slightly higher than the prevalence reported by UNICEF (50%,
2013) and the DHS (53% in children 6–59 months old, 2008–9), as our sample is representative of rural and small
urban centers in the country, excluding the capital and larger cities.
Bradley and Corwyn 2002; Burchinal et al. 2000; Duncan and Brooks-Gunn 1997; Evans 2004;
Hart and Risley 1995; Hoff 2003; Walker et al. 2011; Yeung et al. 2002). We focused on two
subdomains from the HOME that were found to be correlated with math and literacy scores among
children 7–10 years of age in the reference population: the domain relating to fostering growth and
education and the domain relating to the provision of active stimulation (Bradley and Corwyn
2005).5 The adapted HOME scale was included in the model as an ordinal scale from 0–10, with
one point per item (see appendix S2 for complete list of questions).


                                                               III.   EMPIRICAL METHODS

The empirical methods described below for the analyses are parametric in nature, and, as such, are
correlational. We are careful throughout the analysis in claiming neither causality nor inference
about structural parameters in our results.

                                      Magnitude and Evolution of the Socioeconomic Gradients

The primary objective of our analysis is to document the magnitude of the association between
child development outcomes and disparities in SES and to document its evolution over time. We
have a multidimensional set of domains (indexed by         with data on cognition (visual spatial
processing, working memory, and reasoning), language, and executive function spanning the
preschool years when children were 3–6 years old to the school years when children are seven and
older. For disparities in SES, household wealth quintiles from when children were 0–3 years are
used6.
    In a parametric framework,          gradients are estimated by OLS using the following
specification (Todd and Wolpin 2007):

                                                                        ′
                                             ∑5      2           ∗                        1, … ,   t=1,2 (1)

where          is the adjusted z-score (internally standardized) obtained for child i on the
developmental domain j at time t.           is the magnitude of the gradient for k-th quintile        ,
expressed as the size of the difference in mean z-scores obtained by wealth quintile        relative to
the bottom quintile (k=1, the excluded category). The error term includes unobserved child and
household characteristics clustered at the village level, which is our primary sample unit. The base
specification is performed on the pooled sample and includes demographics (age and gender) and
the full set of wealth quintile dummies (and urban and regional dummies). The evolution of the
gap over time is modeled by adding a full set of interactions between quintile indicators and age
dummies, thereby allowing        to flexibly vary with age.
    The robustness of the results is assessed by controlling for a large set of childhood and parental
characteristics	 . First, the longitudinal dimension of the panel is exploited and lagged child
                                                            
     5. Items were adapted to what was appropriate for a mostly poor and rural Malagasy context based on input from
a local clinical psychologist.
     6. Results are robust to using wealth rankings using the contemporaneous wealth indicators. These results are not
presented but are available upon request.
development outcomes added in specification (i), which captures the full range of past observed
and unobserved inputs as well as child-specific early conditions (perceived birth weight and
stunting status, which are used as proxy for early investments in health and nutrition during the
early years).7 Subsequently, time-invariant parental endowments are added such as maternal
education and height and receptive vocabulary, in specification (ii). Finally, variation in the results
is assessed by the inclusion of key observed inputs such as the HOME, in specification (iii).

                                                                   Closing the Gap

The estimates in (1) are used to assess the extent to which differences in inputs (such as the adapted
HOME) can account for the magnitude of the estimated wealth gradients in child development.
Specifically, the estimates of the full specification (iii) are used to assess how much of the gap in
test scores can be closed by equalizing those determinants to the level of the highest wealth
quintile, all other things being equal. Note that the adapted HOME environment scale is available
only in 2011. Lagged inputs have been shown to be jointly significant determinants of child
development in other settings (as in Todd and Wolpin 2007). In the full specification (iii), lagged
HOME environment is subsumed into lagged child outcomes and therefore unaccounted for in the
closing the gap exercise. As such, these estimates will likely be a lower bound estimate on the role
of differences in inputs in accounting for differences in child outcomes.

                                       Mapping School Readiness to School Learning Outcomes

Finally, we assess how the gaps in the child development scores map to learning outcomes at time
 =2. As documented in the data section, the learning outcomes are censored: a fraction of the
children in our sample (as in other developing countries such as in Paxson and Schady 2007) are
not able to attain a basic score in either literacy or math. Censoring will bias OLS estimates of the
gradient downwards (Chay and Powell 2001). Since estimation with MLE is consistent only under
normality and homoscedasticity, a censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) estimator is used to
estimate the following equation:

                                        max	 ,                 ∑    ∗        ∑               )     (2)

where       are the observed, age standardized, learning (literacy and math) scores. For observed
scores that are above the threshold c, learning outcomes are modeled as a function of SES, and an
increasing set of controls as above (lagged outcomes       , maternal education, and endowments,
HOME). Finally, sensitivity to the inclusion of the concurrent/contemporaneous child
development scores (         is checked. As in Cunha and Heckman (2007), this exercise has no
causal interpretation, but it serves the purpose of mapping the magnitude of child development
scores across different domains onto a metric of school achievement and learning.

                                                            
     7. While including a lagged dependent variable can lead to biased estimates if there is measurement error and
latent heterogeneity in ability or endowments, in practice the extent of the bias in the dynamic value-added model
appears to be limited in related education studies when the estimates are compared to experimental or quasi-
experimental estimates (Angrist et al. 2013, Andrabi et al. 2011). It is also important to point out that we are not
interested in estimating structural parameters in this setting but to describe the magnitude and evolution of the wealth
gaps in child development.
                                           IV.   RESULTS

Of the 1504 age-eligible children in 2004, 92.1% (n=1385) were tracked in either or both years
(figure 1). Only 119 children (7.9%) could not be found in either 2007 or 2011, with about half of
those who could not be found reported to be deceased (n=55). The children lost to follow-up in
both years were nearly three months younger on average than the children who were tracked; they
were not significantly different by gender, birth weight, maternal education, or household
crowding in 2004.

Figure 1. Sample attrition and selection




Note: Due to cost-considerations, a random subsample of 150 of the 446 communities (excluded
296), representative of all rural and urban areas excluding the largest urban cities, was selected for
a longitudinal study


   Table 1 presents characteristics of the sample in 2011, overall and by wealth quintiles. Wealth
quintiles capture differences in housing conditions, assets, and livestock ownership. Wealth
quintiles are evenly represented in urban and rural areas, with a slightly larger share of urban
households in the top wealth quintile. Nearly a quarter of the mothers had received no formal
education (up to half in the lowest wealth quintile) and about one-fifth of the children were
perceived to be born with low birth weight by mothers (up to one-quarter in the lowest wealth
quintile).

   *Maternal vocabulary represents estimated ability for the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Tests obtained from an item

       A comparison of descriptive statistics for the 2011 test scores by wealth quintile is presented
   in table 2. For all the child development test scores, there is a larger difference in test scores when
   comparing the middle wealth quintiles relative to the richest quintile (Q5 versus Q3) than from
   comparing the middle quintile to the poorest one (Q3 versus Q1). Across all age groups, 30% of
   our 2011 sample of school-age children did not attend school. The percentage of seven-year-olds
   who are not enrolled in school in our sample is about 50%, decreasing to 13% at age ten years.
   This pattern of delayed enrollment exhibits important differences across wealth quintiles, with
   40% of children in the lowest wealth quintile not in school as opposed to 6% in the highest wealth
   quintile. Delayed enrollment has been shown to have important economic costs in terms of total
   grades completed (Alderman et al. 2001; Glewwe and Jacoby 1995). The learning test used in this
   study is designed to be administered to children both in and out of school; in spite of the fact that
   the test is supposed to be flexible, performance is highly censored, with three-quarters of the
   children not attending school reaching a high score of five (median two) in the literacy test as
   opposed to 40 (median 18) among those attending school (figure A1 in the appendix). As a
   consequence, wealth gaps in learning outcomes reflect a combination of delayed age of enrollment,
   as well as performance conditional on enrollment.

        Although the mathematics test is well distributed, the literacy test is positively skewed. The
   bimodal distribution of scores for the literacy test is consistent with responding correctly to the
   comprehension questions administered after listening to a short story; any additional points for
   literacy required some knowledge of letters. In the analysis, the literacy test is defined to be
   censored at zero and the mathematics test to be censored at a raw score of five, representing about
   12% of our non-missing responses in both cases.

   Table 3 presents the estimated wealth coefficients across four specifications. For parsimony, table
   3 reports only coefficients for the top wealth quintile relative to the first quintile, but the full set of
   coefficients on all wealth quintiles and other regressors are presented in table A1 in the appendix.
   The four specifications are expressed in the different columns. The base model includes
   demographics and wealth (column base). The following group of regressors are added
   consecutively to test for robustness: (i) lagged test values and early child conditions; (ii) maternal
   education and endowments; and (iii) home environment.

Note: The dependent variable is the standardized score of each test, normalized to have mean zero and standard
deviation of one by 2-months age groups. Sample size is 1,234. Estimation is done using ordinary least squares, with
robust standard errors clustered at the village level. Each cell presents the estimated coefficient (and robust standard
error) on quintile 5 relative to quintile 1 for each specification. Coefficients on quintiles 2-4 are not reported for
parsimony. Demographics include age (in years) dummies, gender, birth order dummies, urban and regional dummies.
Lagged outcomes include all lagged z-scores as measured in 2007, as well as lagged stunting indicators and low birth
weight indicators. Maternal endowments include the log of maternal height, maternal education defined as completed
primary, secondary or higher (relative to no schooling), the maternal vocabulary score, and a crowding indicator.
Home environment includes the total HOME score. *,**,*** denote significance at 10%, 5% and 1% levels.

     The coefficients on wealth quintiles are significant for all outcome domains tested and are
robust to the inclusion of a rich set of regressors across all four specifications. In the base model,
accounting only for demographic variables, the estimated gap in z-scores between the fifth and
first wealth quintiles ranges from approximately 1.1 SD for vocabulary to 0.7 SD for memory of
phrases. After adding lagged child development outcomes and early conditions (i), the association
between SES and child development outcomes for the school age period are reduced across all
domains but still statistically significant.
     The estimated wealth differences drop further when maternal education and endowments (ii)
are added and again after adding home environment (iii); the magnitude of the estimated
differences between the bottom and top wealth quintiles are reduced by up to one-half of the base
model estimates while remaining statistically significant. The largest gradients, after controlling
for all observed explanatory variables, are observed for receptive vocabulary and sustained
attention.
     In the full set of results presented in table A1, maternal endowments (education and
vocabulary) are highly significant in all specifications, over and above wealth. Importantly, the
home environment is significant in addition to controlling for maternal endowments, suggesting
an important mediating role in family inputs explaining wealth differences in child development.

                        Evolution and Timing of Emergence of Wealth Gradients

In this section, the evolution of the wealth gradient is modeled across ages, with a fully flexible
parametrization of wealth and age interactions. For the purpose of this analysis, ages 3–4 in 2007
and 6–7 in 2011 are merged to balance the size of each age category. Table 4 presents the
coefficients of the top wealth quintile (relative to the bottom wealth quintile) at age 3–4 in the base
model (first row). (The full set of results for all age and wealth quintile interactions are reported
in table A2 in the appendix.) The bottom part of the table presents tests for the difference in the
magnitude of the coefficients of the top wealth quintile interactions at different ages.

    Gradients are large and significant by ages 3–4 for all outcome measures, in line with the
evidence in the literature of the early emergence of SES gradients. Two patterns emerge from the
comparison of the magnitude of the SES gradient at different ages. First, for vocabulary and
sustained attention, the gradient grows steadily, as evidenced by the comparison of the coefficients
of the interaction between wealth quintile and the corresponding ages (age five versus age 3–4,
age six versus age 3–4, and age 7–8 versus age 3–4). The second contrasting pattern is for the
cognitive composite and memory of phrases where the gradient widens later (age 7–8 versus age
3–4), which is the time of primary school enrollment. For all domains, the gradient flattens out at
age 9–10, with no statistically significant difference between ages 7–8 and ten years (last row).
    Figures 2 (a–d) mirror the results in table 4, with a visual representation of the evolution of the
SES gradient: each figure displays the estimated coefficients of the full set of wealth quintiles age
interactions plotted for a given outcome, with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The
SES gradient for sustained attention originates early, widens up to six years of age but then flattens
out after seven years old (figure 2a). For receptive vocabulary, the wealth gradient widens from
age 4–6 and then continues to widen after age six (figure 2b). The widening across age is less
marked for the memory of phrases and the cognitive composite (figures 2c and 2d).

Next, we follow Todd and Wolpin (2007) and estimate how much of the predicted wealth gap in
early outcomes is accounted for by differences in a key determinant of early child development:
home stimulation. Table 5 presents how much of the wealth gap would be reduced if children from
the lowest wealth group received the same inputs (e.g., home stimulation) on average as those
received by children in the high wealth group, holding everything else constant.

Note: Predicted gaps obtained from the full model (iii) with lagged test values and early child conditions, maternal
education and endowments; and home environment. The cells in equalizing inputs use model estimates, where the
home environment variable input for low SES (Q1) is set to be equal to the mean value of high SES (Q5), all else
being equal. Confidence intervals were constructed from a non-parametric bootstrap with 10,000 replications.

   The predicted mean difference in the outcomes between high and low wealth groups (i.e., the
“gap”) is approximately 1 to 1.6 SD in the age-adjusted z-scores (table 5). Home stimulation
accounts for 12-18% of the wealth gap in z-scores across the various domains. The largest absolute
reductions in the gap (column 2) are found for outcomes that appear to be more sensitive to verbal
communication: receptive vocabulary and memory of phrases, which is a verbal measure of
working memory.

                       Mapping School Readiness to School Learning Outcomes

We next turn to mapping the child development outcomes to learning outcomes. Table 6 presents
the association between wealth and our two school learning outcomes, math and early literacy,
estimated with a CLAD model that accounts for censoring (equation 2). Each cell represents the
coefficient of the top wealth quintile (relative to the bottom quintile) in math and literacy scores
across different specifications. The results from the base model show sizeable gaps in learning
outcomes across SES groups: the differences in math and literacy outcomes between the top and
bottom quintiles are about 1.3 SD (table 6, base specification). As with the school readiness
outcomes (table 3), wealth differences remain robust to the inclusion of lagged developmental
outcomes and early inputs as well as maternal education and endowments. The wealth gap remains
significantly associated with math but borderline with literacy, with the inclusion of our proxy for
the home environment (table 6, specifications [i]–[iii]). The magnitudes of the gap for school
 learning outcomes are comparable to those obtained for school readiness across each of the model
 specifications (i)– (iii).
     In specification (iv), contemporaneous developmental outcomes are included in the model, and
 the wealth gradient ceases to be significant. These results suggest that the school-age
 developmental outcomes account for the remaining associations between learning outcomes and
 wealth, suggesting a close mapping of our school-based outcomes with our contemporaneous
 developmental outcomes (sustained attention, receptive vocabulary, and cognitive composite).

 Note: The dependent variable is the standardized score of each test, normalized to have mean zero and standard
 deviation of one by 2-months age groups in each wage of the full sample. Estimation is done using censored least
 absolute deviations estimator (CLAD) and bootstrap estimates of its sampling variance. We present the estimated
 coefficient (and 95% confidence intervals of bootstrap estimates using the normal approximation) on quintile 5 relative
 to quintile 1, and the pseudo R-squared for each model. Coefficients on quintiles 2-4 are not reported for parsimony.
 Demographics include age (in years) dummies, gender, birth order dummies, urban and regional dummies. Lagged
 ability and early conditions include all lagged z-scores for developmental measures as assessed in 2007, as well as
 lagged stunting indicators and low birth weight indicators. Maternal endowments include the log of maternal height,
 maternal education defined as completed primary, secondary or higher (relative to no schooling), the maternal
 vocabulary score, and the crowding indicator. Home environment includes the total HOME score. Concurrent ability
 include the concurrent developmental measures as assessed in 2011.

    The full set of regressors is presented in appendix table A2. Lagged cognition is a significant
predictor of math across the different specifications (i), (ii), and (iii). In addition, all four lagged
readiness outcomes are significantly associated with literacy at school age in specification (i).

                                       IV.     CONCLUSIONS

There are wealth gradients in child development that start early, change over time, and accumulate
with age. Data from a longitudinal cohort of children living in Madagascar are used to document
that, even in the context of a very low income country where more than 2/3 of the population lives
below the poverty line, wealth gradients are substantial. The gradients are robust to the inclusion
of a large set of explanatory variables, from lagged outcomes and early conditions to maternal
education and endowments to the inclusion of parenting inputs.
    Our four main findings are as follows. First, the SES gradients observed at preschool age are
shown to persist into school age across all developmental domains tested. Substantial gradients in
school readiness outcomes by household wealth are evident when the children were 3–4 years old;
these gradients widen with increasing child age and flatten out by ages 9–10 for all domains.
Second, the magnitude and evolution of the wealth gradient are found to vary by domain, widening
earlier for receptive vocabulary and sustained attention (between ages three and six) and later for
the cognitive composite and memory of phrases (between ages 7–8). As reported previously, when
the children were 3–6 years, vocabulary and sustained attention demonstrate the largest gradients
when these same children are 7–10 years after controlling for lagged outcomes, maternal
endowments, and home environment. Third, an estimated 12–18% of the predicted wealth gap in
school readiness at ages 7–10 can be accounted for by differences in home stimulation at the same
age, even when controlling for early skills and initial endowments. Finally, there are also
significant SES gaps in learning outcomes (math and early literacy) when the children are 7–10
years old, mapping closely onto the gaps for our school readiness outcomes. As with the readiness
measures, the significance of the wealth gradients in learning outcomes is robust to the inclusion
of lagged outcomes and initial endowments.
    Our results align with previous evidence that measures of executive function and language
would be potentially more sensitive to the effects of household wealth or maternal education. The
differential widening gradient may be due, in part, to the differential timing of development of
various regions of the brain (Lenroot and Giedd 2006), although we do not have the data to
understand these mechanisms.
    The timing and widening of the SES gradients confirms the importance of investing during the
early years, because of the brain’s greater plasticity (i.e., capacity to benefit from environmental
interventions) and the timing of physiologic development (Shonkoff 2011). These developmental
benefits of early intervention are supported by a strong economic argument for intervening as early
as possible (Doyle et al. 2009). During the first five years of life, children’s language, early
understanding of mathematics and reading, and self-control emerge. The extent to which children
master these skills during this sensitive period has implications for success in school (Lerner 1998).
There is also evidence that performance in early measures of executive function is associated with
performance in later measures of academic skill, such as early math and reading ability (Blair and
Razza 2007).
    In addition to highlighting the importance of addressing poverty in early childhood, we find
that SES continues to play a critical role into middle childhood. Our estimates from Madagascar
                                                                                                     17 

 
 


of how much of the wealth gap in developmental outcomes can be accounted for by differences in
the home environment (12–18%) are in line with studies in middle- and high-income countries. In
the analysis of an SES gradient in Ecuador, a measure of parenting was found to be associated
with a 21% decrease in the effect of maternal education and a 41% decrease in the effect of paternal
education (Paxson and Schady 2007).	Todd and Wolpin (2007) found that equalizing HOME inputs
accounted for about 10–20% of the racial gap in test scores in the US. We acknowledge that our
estimates represent a lower bound estimate of the effects of home environment as the effect of
lagged home investments is subsumed by lagged outcomes in our analysis.
    Our results related to “closing the gap” have significant policy implications. We have shown
that bringing home stimulation in all groups up to the mean score of the higher SES group would
result in a substantial reduction of the SES gradient for several key outcomes. While it is hard to
influence SES disparities in the short term, our research and that of others suggest that programs
that improve home environments and early child stimulation would have the potential to close 10–
20% of the wealth gap. A full assessment of the specific policies would require more in-depth
knowledge about the costs of such policies as well as knowledge of how mothers and families
make decisions about the inputs they provide for their children, which is beyond the scope of our
paper. We are currently investigating the possible benefits (and associated cost) of introducing an
integrated nutrition and early stimulation intervention in Madagascar that encourages parents to
talk, play, and provide cognitive stimulation to their infants and young children (aged 0–3 years)
for improved development (Fernald et al. 2016). The magnitudes of the wealth gap for school
learning outcomes is comparable to those obtained for school readiness even when controlling for
lagged outcomes, maternal endowments, and home environment. Additionally, the wealth gradient
for school learning outcomes ceases to be significant when contemporaneous school readiness
outcomes are added to the model, indicating that the school-age developmental outcomes account
for the remaining association between learning outcomes and wealth. This close mapping between
school readiness and learning outcomes suggests that school readiness measures are a reasonable
way to assess children’s potential without censoring in settings of low school attendance, which is
instrumental in projecting the estimated wealth differences in child outcomes to adult outcomes.

Appendix 1. Tests of cognitive and language tests administered to children

    Cognition: Three sub-scales of the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales for Early Childhood, 5th edition (ESB5)
(Roid, 2003) were combined to estimate children’s non-verbal cognitive ability:
    (i) Visual-spatial processing (ESB5): Consisted of inserting geometric shapes into a board, or arranging them
to match a given model (internal consistency α = 0.71 and 0.79 in ’07 and ’11 respectively, assumes items after
stopping rule have score zero).
    (ii) Working memory (ESB5): In a series of items of increasing difficulty, the child is asked to find hidden
objects or to reproduce a sequence of tapping blocks according to a given pattern (α = 0.83 and 0.71 in ’07 and
’11 respectively). This sub-scale evaluates the child’s capacity for executive function, spatial perception and for
retaining and manipulating information.
    (iii) Fluid Reasoning (ESB5): Consists of identifying an element that completes a series, or a missing panel
in a matrix (α = 0.73 and 0.69 in ’07 and ’11 respectively). It evaluates the capacity for comprehension of logical
associations and the skill to solve a figurative problem.
    No changes were made to the original version of the sub-scales, although two simplified matrices were created
and added in 2011 as training items for the fluid reasoning task.

    Sustained Attention: From the completely non-verbal Leiter International Performance Scales (Leiter-R)
(Roid & Miller, 1997), this test includes 4 trials and consists of marking images that match a model image (e.g. a
sun) as quickly as possible (α = 0.81 and 0.83 in ’07 and ’11 respectively). Some of the images in the
commercially available test were replaced to reflect the local context (e.g. an image of a zebu, a type of ox,
replaced that of a cow).

     Memory of phrases: Adapted from a subscale from the Woodcock-Muñoz assessment (Woodcock & Munoz,
1996), this test requires children to repeat words and sentences spoken by the interviewer that are increasingly
long and difficult (α = 0.87 and 0.83 in ’07 and ’11 respectively). A Malagasy version of this exercise was not a
literal translation and was created to match the English version’s principle of increasing order of difficulty of the
items.

    Receptive language: Receptive language was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, 3rd
edition, version B (PPVT-III) (Dunn, 1965), which consists of asking the subject to point to an image on a sheet
of four images that corresponds to a word spoken by the interviewer (α = 0.90 and 0.93 in ’07 and ’11
respectively). When no direct translations into Malagasy existed for an English word, the words were either
spelled using Malagasy orthography or translated to French. Images that were culturally inappropriate or
ambiguous in the local language were replaced with a comparable image (e.g. a depiction of US dollars and cents
was replaced with a picture of ariary and iraimbilanja, the currency used in Madagascar).
    For all tests, we ensured overlapping items or tasks were incorporated in both time periods to take advantage
of the longitudinal nature of the study. Many of the same interviewers were hired in both survey years, worked
in pairs (one administering the test and one scoring), and received extensive classroom and field training prior to
both surveys. Excellent inter-rater reliability (ρ > 0.95) was obtained during the training session for the 2007
survey.

    Mathematics Skills: The mathematics test was adapted from USAID’s Early Grade Mathematics Assessment
(EGMA), building on the previous experience in adapting the test in a prospective school feeding evaluation
carried out by J-PAL and the Ministry of Education. The math test includes sections on figures recognition,
counting, math operations and logical skills. There is a large difference in the languages used by children for
                                                                                                                  22 

 
 

mathematics in Madagascar: many schools teach math in French, others teach in Malagasy, especially in the rural
areas. The system of reading numbers differs between the two languages, and differs even among the dialects.
Therefore, the children were allowed to read the numbers and reply to the problems in whichever language they
preferred. All problems were also presented visually on a large card. An indicator was added to capture the
language that the child used for the math test: French, Malagasy, or both.

    Early literacy Skills: The early literacy test was adapted from USAID’s Early Grade Reading Assessment
(EGRA), also building on the previous administration in country by the Ministry of Education and J-PAL. The
test includes sections on sound recognition, recognition of letters and words, and two short stories, one for
auditory comprehension and a second for reading out loud with subsequent comprehension questions. Several
iterations of the stories were pre-tested during the training of the examiners before the stories and related questions
were finalized. We wanted to assure that all children would be able to answer at least the first auditory
