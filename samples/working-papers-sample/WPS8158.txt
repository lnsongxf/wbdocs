1. Introduction
    Urban transportation in Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon, where more than 40% of the
country’s total population lives, is facing several challenges, including inadequate infrastructure,
traffic congestion, local air pollution and road accidents. The fifteen-year civil war between 1975
and 1990 caused significant destruction of the transportation infrastructure and contributed to the
deterioration of the public transport system (Diab and Obeid, 2012). Expansion of urban transport
capacity is not meeting the speed of population growth and urbanization, the centralization of
activity around the capital and more recently the huge refugee influx from the Syrian Arab
Republic. Traffic congestion is considered one of Beirut’s most serious urban development
problems.
    The urban transportation problem is such that up to 70% of travel time in the Greater Beirut
Area (GBA) is lost in delays due to traffic congestion, and the average reported intermodal road
speed is 11 kilometers per hour (calculated as the weighted average speed across all modes). Car
speed is within 9.4-13.5 km/hour. Bus speed is 6.5-9.3 km/hour, minibus speed is 7.5-10.8 km/hour
and taxi speed is in the range of 8.6-12.3 km/hour (all calculated from Abou Zeid and Hassan
(2016)). The congestion problem is increasing due to rapid motorization along with increased
household income and growth of middle income households. Almost half of the total vehicles in
Lebanon circulate in the GBA and the traffic volume in the GBA reaches 7,000 vehicles per hour
in the northern entrance of Beirut (World Bank, 2015).
    Traditionally in developing as well as developed countries, supply-side measures are offered
to address traffic congestion problems. These include expansion of road networks and
improvement of public transportation systems through the introduction of new or the expansion of
existing light rail transit, bus rapid transit and metro systems (see, for example Chalak et al.
(2016)). In addition to these supply side responses, there is growing interest in using demand side
measures, particularly fiscal or pricing reforms to address the broader societal costs (or negative
externalities) of transportation systems.3 A more novel approach is congestion tolls, which
economists have long advocated as an effective way of allocating scarce roadway capacity to the
highest valued users.

 See Timilsina and Dulal (2008) for an in-depth discussion of fiscal policy instruments to reduce congestion and
environmental pollution from urban transportation.

    Several studies have evaluated demand side instruments for other cities in the developing
world.4 However, there exist very few studies of cities in the Mediterranean/North Africa (MENA)
region. Parry and Timilsina (2012) evaluated demand side instruments to reduce urban transport
externalities in the Greater Cairo Metropolitan Region (GCMR). However, demand side
instruments alone may not provide the best solutions to reduce negative externalities from urban
transportation if supply-side measures that complement the demand side instruments are limited.
For example, increased taxation of private vehicles either through fuel, mileage driven or upfront
capital costs would not cause sufficient substitution of private vehicles with mass transportation if
adequate infrastructure for mass transportation does not exist. It is therefore important to examine
the trade-offs between demand and supply-side instruments. The existing literature has not
analyzed the demand and supply instruments together, focusing instead on demand side
instruments only (see. e.g., Parry and Timilsina, 2012; Parry and Timilsina, 2015; Anas and
Timilsina, 2015). This study compares both supply and demand side instruments.
    The extent to which the supply side and demand side instruments would be effective in the
GBA is an empirical question considering several characteristics specific to the GBA. For
example, the GBA offers only a limited number of alternatives to private vehicles. Motorization
has rapidly increased despite the fact that import duties on vehicles account for more than 50% of
a vehicle’s total value, the gasoline tax is one of the highest in the region and parking space is
severely limited. The situation is worsened by the high cost of housing which causes people to
reside away from the city center whereas most jobs are concentrated there. The city also lacks a
reliable public transportation system. The GBA’s transportation system is additionally strained
due to the influx of Syrian refugees over the last few years. Affluent Syrian families, concentrated
in the GBA, have brought their cars into Lebanon and intra-city trips in the GBA have significantly
increased. It is estimated that the influx of Syrian refugees has resulted in sudden traffic increases
in the GBA in the range of 15-25% (World Bank, 2015).
    We develop an empirical model that can simulate both supply and demand side policy
instruments to reduce the negative externalities from urban transportation in the GBA. On the
supply side, the model considers expansion of urban roads, a bus rapid transit running on special

lanes and an increased number of regular buses. On the demand side, policy instruments included
are higher fuel and parking pricing. The model represents the behavior of all relevant agents
including households, producers (commercial enterprises) and the government. Travel cost
includes various monetary costs to households including transit fares, expenditures on automobile
fuel, possible congestion tolls levied on auto travel, and the costs of vehicle ownership as well as
value of their time (e.g., wage rate). Households have a choice to live nearby their workplaces
paying higher rents but avoiding costs of commuting, or they can live away from city centers with
lower rental costs and real estate values but pay higher cost for commuting (including the value of
time). Through a budget constraint, more spending on travel implies a trade-off as households
have less money for other goods. Travel by each mode also involves a time cost, which again
involves a trade-off as this reduces the amount of time people have available for other activities at
home. Travel time per mile differs across modes, and reflects the inverse of the average travel
speed for a transportation vehicle. The model is calibrated with data from Beirut and the economic
implications of several urban transportation policies are simulated.

   We study several policy packages. Policy package 1 introduces 120 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
buses which will run on dedicated bus lanes in addition to 250 regular buses. It also includes a
25% increase in the parking tax. Policy package 2 is the same BRT but the parking tax increase is
replaced by additional road lanes in suburban Greater Beirut. Policy package 3 includes building
an international class ring road in suburban Greater Beirut accompanied by a doubling of the
existing excise tax on gasoline. Policy simulation results show an improvement in traffic
congestion and decreases in VMT and gasoline consumption across all three policy
scenarios. Policy packages 1 and 2 show big gains in social welfare due to a significant increase
in traffic speed under BRT. The cost-benefit ratio for each policy can be measured as a gain in
social welfare in Lebanese pounds (LBP) per LBP of expenditure. While the cost-benefit ratio is
9.6 and 5.01 for Policy packages 1 and 2 respectively, the cost of implementing Policy package 3
outweighs its benefit.
       There are a few existing studies for Beirut analyzing various transportation improvement
scenarios such as the re-organization of the bus system and the implementation of bus rapid transit
(e.g. DMJM & Harris and INI Group, 2003; IBI Group and TEAM, 2009). The existing studies
are, however, limited to economics specific to the project activities, whereas the current study
assesses the impacts to the entire city considering many factors, normally not included in a project

economic analysis, such as potential changes in the wage rate and real estate prices using a city
level general equilibrium framework.
   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model equations and the equilibrium
structure of the model. Section 3 describes how the model was calibrated from the data, followed
by a description of the policy instruments and the scenarios simulated in the study. Section 4
presents and discusses the various policy instruments, and Section 5 presents the effects of the
three policy packages. Appendix A presents supplemental tables that include the detailed output
of the simulations. Section 6 draws conclusions. Detailed descriptions of data are presented in
Appendix B (a summary of the more extensive report by Abou Zeid and Hassan (2016)).


2. Model structure

       The metropolitan area is divided into two zones as shown in Figure 1. The central area is
zone 1 (Municipal Beirut or MB) and the outer area is zone 2 (Greater Beirut or GB). We will use
the subscripts i, j, z  1, 2 to denote these zones where i will be used for the zone as a place of
residence, j as a place of work (job location) and the destination of a commute, and z as the
destination of a non-work or shopping trip from i. Modes of travel are m  1,..., 4 , where m  1 is
private car, m  2 public bus, m  3 is minibus and m  4 is taxi. Bus rapid transit is introduced
as a fifth mode as needed. All four modes share the roads.
        The model consists of consumers, firms, real estate developers and the public sector and
follows the economic methodology of Anas and Liu (2007). In the labor markets, consumers who
are workers and firms that offer jobs are matched up and equilibrium wages are determined in each
zone j  1, 2. In production, output produced in each zone satisfies the demand for export and for
consumption from local consumers coming to shop in that zone. In the residential (k  1) and
commercial (k  2) building markets, consumers and firms are matched up to the stock of housing,
and rents are determined for each type of building floor space in each zone i  1, 2. The stock of
buildings is adjusted by real estate developers who construct and demolish residential and
commercial buildings. Demolishing buildings creates land that is added to the available
developable land, and constructing buildings reduces the available developable land. The transport
sector is controlled by the government that sets gasoline taxes, parking fees and can increase the

capacity of roads and buses. Such actions are compared by calculating the value of social welfare,
which will be explained later.

2.1 Consumers
        Consumers who work choose the triplet (i, j, m) that is a place of residence (housing), a
place of work and a mode m for commutes and non-work trips. Thus, there are 2  2  4  16
discrete alternatives. In an inner stage of the choice process, the consumer chooses for each
(i, j, m) , continuous variables: the quantity of floor space h at zone i , and the quantity of goods
Z z the consumer would buy at z  1, 2. Thus, in the inner stage the consumer maximizes the
following direct utility function:
                  max U ijm  1   i  ln[  ( Z z |ijm ) ]1/   i ln hijm   ln  2Gijm   Eijm  eijm ,   (1)

The parameters are as follows. i is the share of disposable income spent on housing and 1  i is

                                                                    1
the share spent on goods purchased from z  1, 2.                      is the elasticity of substitution between
                                                                  1 
goods from z  1 and z  2;   0 controls the disutility of the commuting time, Gijm , so that the

                              1
marginal disutility is           . Eijm are fixed amenity effects of the choice (i, j, m), and eijm are
                             2Gijm

random utilities that for each (i, j, m) vary among the consumers. On the right side of the budget

constraint we have the annual earned income w j Hd where H is work hours per day and d is the

number of work days per year and w j is the hourly wage rate at workplace j. M i is unearned

income. gijm is the daily two-way monetary cost of commuting from residence zone i to workplace

zone j using mode m. g jm
                       p
                          is the daily parking cost at j. Only private cars incur parking cost, and

this is captured by 1  1 and m  0 for m  1. Hence, the right side of the budget constraint is

the worker’s disposable income after commuting-related monetary costs are subtracted from
annual earned plus unearned income. On the left side is the expenditure of the worker, consisting
of housing floor area rented in zone i at the unit housing rent RHi , and expenditure on goods
purchased    in    zones       z=1       and        z=2      at     the    travel-cost-inclusive   unit   prices

parenthesis is the two-way monetary cost of the trip and the parking and qizm is the number of trips
needed to purchase a unit quantity.
    Nonworking consumers solve the same problem, except that there is no workplace or
commuting cost, hence unearned income is the only part of their disposable income. Dropping the
workplace subscript j:

subject to the budget constraint:

                                     p

2.3 Transportation
        As mentioned earlier, in the transportation sector there are trips by the four modes (private
car, bus, minibus and taxi), and two trip purposes: commutes from residence to workplace location
and non-work trips to buy goods. These trips are loaded to the road network to generate monetary
costs of travel, gijm , per person-trip under conditions of congestion. In addition, parking costs for

private cars, g jm
                p
                   , are also part of the transportation sector. The congested travel times, Gijm , consist

of three additive components: waiting time, in-vehicle time and access/egress time:
                                                 Gijm  Gijm, wait  Gijm, invehicle  Gijm, access / egress

                                                            (15)
         The monetary cost ex-parking, of a consumer’s person-trip by mode m, from residence
zone i to workplace zone or non-work trip destination j is given by:

Recalling that 1  1 for the private car mode, while m  0 for m  2,3, 4, the two additive terms

measure gasoline expenditure and fares. Dij is the one-way trip distance per kilometer and


                                                                9

         Parking cost is positive only for the private car mode. It is assumed that commuters park
off-street and non-work trips can park either off-street or on-street. The average parking cost per
commuter per day (W) is:
                                        g jp1  feeW
                                                   j

                                                                  j
                                                                    , off
                                                                                                                            (19)

And the average parking cost per non-commuter per day (NW) is:

                       g zp1  feezNW ,off  sharezNW ,off  feezNW ,on  sharezNW ,on    5

          To determine congested travel times, we need to add up trips by (i, j, m) and then
calculate the private-car-equivalent traffic loads across the different modes. So the sum of work
and non-work trips by the mode m per day are:
                                                                   1 NW

where the number of consumer-workers is N W , and the work trips are obtained by:
                                                    W

  The percentage of private car commuters that pays for parking is 46% (in j  1 ) and 20% (in j  2 ). In the case of non-work
trips, 25% pays for off-street parking in j  1 but no one pays for off-street parking in j  2 ; whereas the shares of on-street
parking for non-work trips in   j  1 and j  2   are 25% and 20% respectively.

                                                                 10
and the number of non-workers is N NW and the number of non-work trips is obtained by
multiplying the number of workers and non-workers with their respective choice probabilities:

        To combine the trips by mode in order to derive a combined traffic load, we need  m to

convert vehicles of mode m into car-equivalent units. Then, a car-equivalent traffic load is:

CAP1 , CAP2 are road capacities associated with the two zones. These are blended by using the


coefficients 1 , 2 to obtain the capacities of the road relevant to the inter-zonal trips. 1 ,  2 are
coefficients we calibrate.

         Finally, a refinement of the model is to take into account what happens when more
buses or round-trips of existing buses are added to the public transportation system. Adding
buses will increase congestion if the buses run empty or not very full. The inverse vehicle
occupancy ratio for buses should increase, keeping total bus riders constant, but it can decrease
as more people switch to bus, as the added buses reduce waiting times. To capture these two
relationships, we use the functions:
                                                      round  tripsij 2  Busij

and

              The values of floor space ( VHi ,VBi ) and of developable land ( V0i ) are determined by the
following three equations. These are derived by assuming the following competitive bidding
process in stationary state by risk neutral and forward-looking investors, a framework adapted
from Anas and Arnott (1991). Suppose that an investor buys land at the beginning of a time period.
The bid per unit of such land reflects the rent on vacant land that is collected during the period and
the expected value of the capital gains that can be realized by exercising the option to construct
either residential or commercial floor space, or by keeping the land undeveloped. It is assumed
that the investor would choose the most profitable of the three possible actions, but – in the
beginning of the period – does not yet fully know the costs associated with each option.

In the above and the following equations, mki is the structural density (floor space to land area

ratio) of type k building in zone i. Cki is the cost of constructing a type k building in zone i, and

K ki the non-financial cost.  0i is the dispersion parameter of the unobserved nonfinancial costs
for land investors. r is the interest rate.
              An investor owning an existing residential or commercial building acts similarly with the
land investor (and with similar parameters) but has two options: to either demolish the building
or keep it as is. Hence, in the beginning of the period the building investor would bid the rent
from the period plus the expected capital gains from the options to demolish or not:

flow of constructed floor space, an arbitrary assumption the plausibility of which was confirmed

            3. Calibration

                                                                                                                         15
       The elasticity of location choice with respect to housing rent used in the model is -0.35. Anas
and Chu (1984) reported a range for housing cost elasticity between -0.26 to -0.86 from previous
studies and estimated it to be -0.36 for the Chicago MSA. Indra (2014) in a study of 275
metropolitan areas, found the residential choice elasticity with respect to housing cost in US to be
-0.28. We believe any value around -0.36 is very reasonable. Based on this rent elasticity, we
calibrated the dispersion parameter, , in the consumer’s choice probability.
       The elasticity of location choice with respect to commute time weighted across all modes is
-1.0735. The data for this mode choice elasticity is taken from the study for Beirut by Danaf et al.
(2014). Since no mode choice elasticity was present for minibus, we considered the mode choice
elasticity for bus and minibus to be the same. Based on their weighted value of elasticity with
respect to commute time, we calibrated the travel time disutility parameter, , in the consumer’s
choice probability.
       There is no value in the literature related to housing construction from vacant land for Beirut.
We assumed that the probability of housing construction from vacant land is 0.0035 in both MB
and GB. These probabilities are derived from the supply of newly constructed housing floor space
aggregated across MB and GB.6 Assuming that the probability of construction is the same for MB
and GB, the probability of vacant land constructed into housing is derived. As there are no data on
the construction probability of commercial floor space from vacant land, we assumed that the share
is based on the existing commercial floor space relative to residential floor space, adjusting the
residential construction probability with this ratio.
       Based on the above, the elasticity of housing/commercial construction with respect to the
value of housing/commercial floor space was set at 0.5 (MB) and 2.1 (GB). The elasticity of
housing/commercial demolition with respect to the value of vacant land was set at 0.05 (MB) and
0.21 (GB), that is at one-tenth the corresponding construction elasticity. Based on these
construction and demolition elasticity values, the constants in the probabilities of construction and
demolition are calibrated. We also confirmed that the assumed ratio of demolished to constructed
floor space of 40% seems to yield plausible comparative statics results.

    The waiting time function for buses was derived from the relationship between average
waiting time and number of buses as provided in Meignan et al. (2007). In the base case, the
parameter constant,     , is calibrated to match the base data on waiting time for bus by origin
and destination, ( , ). Think of a scenario where there is an increase in bus supply. On the one
hand, this will potentially encourage people to switch to bus from all other modes as the waiting
time for bus improves. This will reduce aggregate traffic for all other modes and hence it will
reduce congestion. On the other hand, additional buses running on roads will take more space and
frequent stops will disrupt the traffic flow, which will increase congestion on the roads. The net
effect depends on how many buses are running on roads, relative to the switch in ridership to bus
from the other modes. Equation (26) implies that an additional bus can potentially create
congestion on the road for the other modes. Equation in (25) is the most commonly used congestion
function. The value of the exponent,   , can typically range from 1.2 to 4. We are using the value
of 3.5 suggested in Arnott (2013). Detailed discussions on the data and key assumptions are
presented in Appendix A. The calibration results are summarized in Tables 1-4.

4. Defining Policy Instruments and Simulation Scenarios
   The study considers both demand side and supply side scenarios. Demand side instruments
aim to reduce the excessive part of the demand for transportation services that relies on private
vehicles. Supply side instruments aim to adjust the infrastructure capacity to provide transportation
services (buses or roads and parking spaces). While there could be a large number of policy
instruments and scenarios, considering all of them is beyond the scope of the study. We considered
the most plausible instruments based on discussions with various stakeholders in Beirut.
4.1. Demand Side Policy Instruments
       Demand side instruments increase the prices of transportation services provided by
automobiles. Such instruments are the fuel tax, the parking fee, congestion charges, the tax on
vehicles, etc. Since motorization has increased despite a very high vehicle tax (import duty),
increasing that tax further may not be very effective. Congestion charges, which have been used
in some cities in developed countries (Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan), may be difficult to
implement in Beirut. So we considered two pricing instruments: the fuel tax and the parking fee.
An increase in transportation cost through an increase in the fuel tax or parking fee would work in
two ways. First, it would reduce transportation service demand from private vehicles by cutting
their unnecessary or wasteful use and second, it would encourage the substitution of private
transportation with public transportation.
Increased fuel taxation: As in many cities around the world, gasoline and diesel are the main fuels
used for transportation in Beirut. Since the excise tax on gasoline in Lebanon was halved from 33
US¢/liter (LBP 9,900/20 liters) to 16.5 US¢/liter (LBP 4,950/20 liters) in March 2011, one scenario
could be to reinstate the previous tax level, doubling the current excise tax rate from that level.
Since diesel is used mainly for public transportation and one strategy to reduce congestion is to
encourage switching from the private transportation mode to the public transportation mode, we
did not apply any tax on diesel.

expensive so that it discourages the use of private vehicles. An increase in parking fee whether it
is off-street parking or on-street parking is expected to contribute to this objective. At present, paid
street parking allows a maximum of two hours of parking on the street. Most commuters use off-
street parking lots or garages. Recent statistics show that 46% of commuters pay for parking in
Municipal Beirut and 20% of commuters pay for parking in Greater Beirut. In 2013, the average
daily off-street parking rate is estimated to be 3,187 LBP/day in Municipal Beirut and 2,500
LBP/day in GB. Considering all commuters (those who pay and those who do not pay for off-
street parking), the average off-street parking cost across commuters is 1,466.1 LBP/day in MB
and 500 LBP/day in GB.
         On-street parking is usually used by non-commuters. Paid (or metered) street parking is
installed only in Municipal Beirut (but not everywhere) and not in Greater Beirut. The current on-
street parking rate is 1,000 LBP/hour. We assumed that 50% of all non-commuting trips park for
free, 25% use paid street parking, and 25% use paid off-street parking. For street parking, the
average duration of parking is assumed to be around 45 minutes (TEAM International, 2009),
resulting in an average street parking cost of 750 LBP. Since the off-street parking rate for
commuters is 3,187 LBP/day, the average parking cost paid by non-commuters in Municipal Beirut
is estimated to be LBP 984.25.7 For GBA, the average parking cost paid by non-commuters is LBP
500.8
4.2. Supply Side Measures
         The objective of the supply side measures is to expand infrastructure capacity including
construction of new roads, particularly in the periphery of Municipal Beirut where land is available
for the expansion of road networks, construction of underground metro or over-ground light
railway transit (LRT), bus rapid transit systems, etc. Considering the huge costs of building
transportation infrastructure and the considerable time needed to complete the mega projects, we
treat two relatively cheaper options: construction of a new ring road in the periphery of Municipal
Beirut (i.e., in GB) and addition of lanes to existing roads.


7
  Off-street parking rate * percent of non-commuters that pay off-street parking + on-street parking rate * percent of
non-commuters that pay on-street parking + 0 * percent of non-commuters that do not pay parking = 3187 * 0.25 +
750 * 0.25 = 984.25.
8
  Off-street parking rate * percent of non-commuters that pay off-street parking + 0 * percent of non-commuters
that do not pay parking = 2500 * 0.2 = 500.

                                                         21
Road expansion in GB: We considered a peripherique (ring road) along the periphery of Municipal
Beirut in GB. This 20-km road is estimated to cost US$2 billion including the cost of expropriation.
It will have two levels with a total (over both levels) of 5 lanes per direction. Assuming a 3.6-m
lane width, the total width is 36 m. The increase in road capacity in Greater Beirut (GB) due to the
Peripherique is then 20,000 m × 36 m = 720,000 m2.
Lane Addition: We considered adding one lane in each direction to the coastal highway along a
10-km section in GB (in the part that falls north of MB). The expected cost is in the range of
US$150 million to US$200 million. Assuming a 3.6-m lane width, the increase in road capacity in
Greater Beirut (GB) due to the lane addition project is 2 × 3.6 × 10,000 = 72,000 m2.
Network extension of buses: Since the government has a plan to purchase 250 new buses to be
deployed in Greater and Municipal Beirut, we considered a scenario of adding these buses which
will be owned by the city. Increasing the number of buses, would reduce bus waiting times due to
increased frequency of service, but the additional buses would also add to road congestion, if they
did not draw enough riders from the other modes.
Introducing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT): BRT will primarily cover 22 km between Beirut-Tabarja
and 20 km within Beirut. As the BRT will run on dedicated lanes, there will be a reduction in road
capacity because one lane will be taken from the road in each direction. This will happen over a
distance of 15 km. So we need to remove from GB a road capacity9 of 108,000 m2. Road capacity
will not decrease in MB as dedicated lanes will be taken from the parking lanes in MB. The
targeted speed that BRT will try to achieve is 30-35 km/hr in GB and 20-25 km/hr in MB. The
expected speed in MB is lower because of traffic lights. The one-way fare of BRT bus is assumed
as 60% higher than regular bus fare.


5. Results of the Policy Simulations
      We first present results from simulations in which we change the values of individual policy
instruments or public investment activities. This is followed by results of three policy packages
where these policy instruments and public investment activities described above, are combined at
different levels. The policy simulation results discussed and presented in this section are driven by
several important margins of adjustment in the model, such as:

    For BRT scenario in GB, 2 lanes * 15 km (length) * 3.6 of width/lane = 108,000 m2.

1) Consumers’ choice of place of residence and place of workplace.
2) Switching of consumers from one mode to another for work and non-work trips.
3) Consumers substituting between composite good consumption and housing floor space
   consumption and between consumption acquired by making non-work trips to MB or GB.
4) Firms substituting between labor and building inputs in production.
5) Conversion of vacant land to residential /commercial floor space construction or demolition of
   residential /commercial floor space to vacant land.
5.1. Results from simulation of individual policy instruments or investment activities
       There are four simulations to measure the impacts of individual policy instruments or
investment actions. These are: (i) Expanding road capacity; (ii) Adding bus capacity; (iii)
Increasing the taxes on gasoline (increase in the excise tax); (iv) Parking cost increase (increasing
the parking tax rate). Below we discuss the most important results from each of these simulations.
Detailed results under each simulation are provided in the long tables of Appendix A.
5.1.1 Expanding road capacity
   The road capacity increase for GB is 720,000 square meters, i.e., an increase of 4.1% in total
road area in GB. Detailed results of this simulation are shown in Table A1.
   After increasing the road supply in GB, population and employment decentralizes to GB. As a
result of that, wages in MB rise and fall in GB since the supply of labor to GB increases at the
expense of the labor supply to MB. The fall in housing demand in MB leads to a fall in the
residential rent in MB. Opposite results can be seen in GB where rent rises due to increase in
housing demand. Price of output increases in MB and decreases in GB. Increase in nominal and
real output increase the demand for commercial floor space resulting in an increase in the rent of
commercial floor space.
   With the increase in road supply, congestion decreases somewhat and because this favors
private vehicles, people switch to private vehicle from the other modes. The aggregate mode share
increases for private vehicles even when the private vehicle trips of MB-to-MB decrease as both
population and employment shift to GB. Travel time decreases across all modes. The aggregate
traffic load decreases for MB-MB and MB-GB but increased for GB-MB and GB-GB. Aggregate
non-work trips along with VMT increase but gasoline consumption decreases due to the improved
speed. The improved speed and the switch to private vehicles result in a decrease in revenues from
the gas tax and public transit fares, but parking tax revenue increases.

                                                 23
   The increase in the rent for commercial floor space stimulates construction and stock increases
in both MB and GB. For residential floor space, stock decreases in MB but increases in GB. The
fall in residential stock in MB frees up land which is in part utilized for the construction of new
commercial floor space. As demand increases for both residential and commercial floor space in
GB, vacant land decreases.
     Workers in MB benefit from falling residential rents and the rising wages along with decrease
in travel cost and travel time, but are adversely affected by the rising output price. Non-workers in
MB benefit from falling residential rents and decrease in travel cost but are affected adversely by
the higher goods prices, whereas workers and non-workers in GB benefit from lower output prices
and lower travel costs but are adversely affected by the increase in residential rents and the
decrease in wages. An average worker seems to be better off by this policy while an average non-
worker is worse-off by this policy. The overall social welfare improves.
   Note that with a congestion function exponent of          = 3.5, the change in social welfare is
bigger than with     = 2. The reason is that the effect of an increase in road capacity begets more
congestion relief when the exponent is higher.
   The main results of this policy on key transportation and economic indicators are summarized
in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively. As illustrated in these figures, the expansion of roads in the GB
would substitute bus (mini and large bus) trips with auto (car and taxi) trips. It would reduce travel
times for all vehicles and also the total travel costs. While revenues from fuel taxation and parking
fees decrease, total rents, total values of properties including existing buildings, new buildings and
vacant lands and gross regional products of the city will increase. Although percentage change in
rental and property values look small, in absolute terms they are large. For example, the expansion
of roads will increase rental values in Beirut (both MB & GB) by 38 billion LBP to 62 billion LBP
depending upon the value for congestion coefficients. Similarly, the expansion of roads will
increase values of properties (residential, commercial and vacant lands in Beirut) by 575 billion
LBP to 801 billion LBP. The gross regional product of Beirut would increase by 42 billion LBP
to 67 billion LBP.

5.1.2 Adding bus capacity
   Bus capacity is increased by 91% across the study area. There are two cases possible based on
whether the bus is completely owned (case 1) or partially owned/rented (case 2). We found that
the results are mostly similar between these two cases. They only differ with respect to the

                                                            25
operational and maintenance costs of new buses which affect the change in the value of social
welfare per person. The results are shown in Tables A2 and A3.
   The increase in bus supply moves more population to MB and more jobs to GB. Wages in MB
increase but decrease in GB. Residential rent decreases in both MB and GB. With an unchanged
price of goods and a decrease in real output, the demand for commercial floor space decreases and
this causes a fall in commercial rents in both MB and GB.
   The increase in bus supply not only improves ridership of bus but also of all the other modes
except private vehicle. However, the biggest gain in ridership is for bus. Increase in bus supply
has two opposing effects: on the one hand, a decrease in bus wait times which improves the travel
time by bus and encourages people to switch from private vehicles, reducing congestion; on the
other hand, if the increase in bus supply does not adequately improve bus ridership then the
additional buses will cause traffic congestion to increase. The increase in bus ridership not only
shifts people from private vehicle to bus but to the remaining modes also. As a result of this
spillover, though travel time by bus decreases due to lower waiting times, travel time for all the
other modes increases due to higher congestion caused by the additional buses. The traffic load
increases for all origin to destination pairs. There is an increase in both aggregate VMT and
gasoline consumption. Gas tax and public transit revenues increase but parking tax revenue
decreases. As the majority of the population uses private vehicles for work and non-work trips, the
resulting increase in trip costs reduces the disposable income. In the short run, reduction in
disposable income reduces housing demand (by the income effect) and hence residential rents.
This reduction in rents causes substitution (the substitution effect) favoring more housing
consumption. Also non-work trips decrease which means that the cost of non-work trips has
increased. This leads to further substitution in favor of housing consumption.
   There is an increase in the stock of residential floor space in both MB and GB. The increase in
the demand for housing results in an increase in the construction of new housing floor space in
MB and GB. But the fall in the nominal value of output affects the construction and the stock of
commercial floor space. The fall in the stock of commercial floor space frees up some land which
is used for the construction of new housing floor space. The stock of vacant land increases which
results in lower rents and values of vacant land.
   For an average worker, the benefit of falling residential rents and an increase in the wage in
MB is less than the adverse effect of a fall in the wage in GB and an increase in travel time. As a

                                                    26
result, an average worker is worse-off. For an average non-worker, the increase in travel time
increases the cost of trips thus reducing their non-work trips. This adverse impact is more than the
benefit of a decrease in residential rent. As a result, an average non-worker is also worse-off. The
social welfare decreases and decreases more with a more congestible road network, that is when
   = 3.5.
        The key impacts on transport activities and city economy are presented in Figure 3a and
3b. As can be seen in Figure 3a, increased addition of buses without expanding road capacity and
only adding buses will deteriorate the congestion situation by increasing travel times of all
vehicles, and does not help reduce congestion in Beirut. Due to increased travel time, gasoline
consumption by car increases. The higher gasoline tax revenue and the increased public transport
revenue would increase total government revenues but it would certainly hurt the consumers.
Consequently, total rental value, total property value and gross regional products of the city will
all drop.

5.1.3 Gasoline tax
   This policy instrument considers doubling of excise tax on gasoline for the reason explained
in scenario definition section above. The detailed results are shown in Table A4. The increase in
the excise tax, shifts population to MB and jobs to GB. There is a decrease in wage and a decrease
in the price of output and a lower nominal value of output in the region. This decreases the demand
for commercial floor space and lowers commercial rents. Because floor space and labor are
substitutes in production, wages are also lowered which reduces residential rent through the
income effect.
   The increase in the excise tax increases the operating cost for modes using gasoline (private
vehicle, minibus and taxi service). For minibus and taxi service, we assumed that the increase in
cost is not transferred to the rider. Under this situation, people switch from private vehicle to all
other modes. Travel time for all modes decreases but the travel cost for private vehicles increases.
As a result, non-work trips decrease along with VMT and gasoline consumption. Gas tax revenue
and public transit revenue increase while parking tax revenue decreases.
   As the majority of people use private vehicle for trips, the increase in the excise tax increases
the cost of non-work trips. The increase in the excise tax dominates the decrease in output prices
which makes the cost of non-work trips increase. The decrease in wage and disposable income

                                                 28
reduces the demand for housing floor space (income effect) which reduces the residential rent.
This rent reduction causes substitution in favor of demand for housing floor space (the substitution
effect). Also with an increase in non-work trip cost, people will shift their demands at the margin
from the composite good to residential floor space.
   From this result, we find that the substitution effect of an increase in the excise tax dominates
its income effect which results in an increase in the stock and construction of residential floor
space. But the decrease in the population of GB plays an important role in reducing the aggregate
demand for housing floor space even in the presence of a strong substitution effect. Hence the
stock and construction of new residential housing decreases in GB. But a falling commercial rent,
reduces both the stock and construction of commercial floor space in MB and GB. As expected
the reduction in stock and construction of both residential and commercial floor space in GB,
increases its stock of vacant land. Whereas in MB, the increase in vacant land due to the fall in
commercial floor space stock is not fully utilized for the construction of new residential floor
space. As a result vacant land increases in MB.
   For the average worker, the benefit from the decrease in the price of output and residential rent,
and the travel time decrease is outweighed by the decrease in wage and the increase in the cost of
commute and shopping trips as the majority of them use private vehicles. Thus an average worker
is worse-off. Non-workers are better off because the benefits outweigh the higher travel cost of
non-work trips and non-workers have no commute costs. The social welfare however is lower
overall. An increase in the exponent of the congestion function, i.e.       = 3.5 which makes the
change in social welfare less negative. The average worker is now better off as the effect of a
decrease in traffic load and hence trip time and trip cost outweighs the negative effect of the tax.
       The key transportation sector and city economic impacts of the increase in the gasoline
excise tax are reflected in Figures 4a and 4b. The discussion of the results above explains the
direction of impacts. The magnitudes of these impacts are also significant. The doubling of
gasoline excise tax would increase total travel costs by 14%. As expected it would increase
government revenues through increases in gasoline tax revenues and increased public
transportation revenues. Although the tax on diesel, the main fuel used for public transportation
vehicles, has not changed, public transport revenue still increases due to increase in public
transportation trips caused by switching of passengers from private transportation to public
transportation. This policy would however have a significant negative impact on the city’s

                                                  29
economy as rents, property values and gross regional products will drop. The drops on rents
amount to 173 billion to 181 billion LBP and the drops on property value would be more than 2
trillion LBP. The nominal gross domestic product of the city drops by almost 200 billion LBP.

5.1.4 Parking cost
   Under this policy, we increased the parking fees. As no specific number is given for parking
fee increases, we have increased it by 10%, 15% and 25%. The detailed results are shown in
Tables A5, A6 and A7. An increase in the parking tax, decentralizes both population and jobs to
GB. Wages, rents and prices decrease. Due to the decrease in the value of nominal product, the
demand for commercial floor space decreases which also decreases the commercial rent.
   An increase in the parking tax, makes consumers switch from private vehicle to all other
modes, improving the speed of all modes. The travel cost by private vehicle also decreases. Traffic
load, VMT and gasoline consumption all decreased. Public transit and parking tax revenues
increase at the expense of gas tax revenue.
    As the majority of people use private vehicles for trips, the increase in parking tax increases
the cost of non-work trips even when the gasoline cost of private vehicles decreases. As a result,
there is a decrease in non-work trips. The increase in the parking tax dominates the decrease in
output price which decreases the cost of non-work trips. The decrease in wage and disposable
income reduces the demand for housing floor space (income effect) which reduces the residential
rent. This rent reduction causes substitution in favor of demand for housing floor space
(substitution effect). Also with an increase in the non-work trip cost, people shift their demand
from the composite good to residential floor space.
     The stock and construction of residential floor space increases in MB but decreases in GB.
For MB, the substitution effect of the parking tax dominates its income effect and it is still strong
enough to increase the stock and construction of residential floor space when the population moves
out to GB. In GB, the residential stock and construction falls as the income effect of the parking
tax dominates the substitution effect and an increase in population. Value and stock for commercial
floor decrease in both MB and GB due to a fall in the nominal value of output. Decrease in
commercial floor space stock frees up land for construction of new residential floor space in MB.
But construction demand for new residential floor space is not enough to compensate for the land
vacated due to the decrease in the stock of commercial floor space. As a result of that vacant land
increases in MB. In GB, the stock of vacant land increases as the stock of both residential and
commercial floor space decreases.
       As most workers use private vehicle for trip purposes, an increase in the parking tax rate
outweighs the benefit of a decrease in prices. Also the adverse impact on wages outweighs the

                                                 31
benefit from the decrease in travel cost, travel time and residential rent. The average worker is
worse-off. Non-workers are better off as the benefit of a decrease in travel cost, travel time and
residential rent is more than the loss in the demand for non-work trips. An increase in the exponent
of the congestion parameter to            = 3.5 makes the change in social welfare less negative. The
average worker is now better off as the effect of a decrease in traffic load and hence trip time and
trip cost outweighs the negative effect of tax.
       The key transportation sector and city economic impacts of 25% increase on parking fee
are reflected in Figure 5a and 5b. The discussion of the results above explains the direction of
impacts. The magnitude of impacts are also significant. The doubling of gasoline excise tax would
increase total travel costs by more than 12%. This policy would have a significant negative impact
on the city’s economy as rents, property values and gross regional products will drop. Although
the percentage drops on rents, property values and gross regional products are small, the absolute
values are not. For example, 25% increase on parking fee would reduce the rents by more than 100
billion LBP and property value by more than 1 trillion LBP. The drop on nominal gross domestic
products of the city would be more than 100 billion LBP.

5.1.5 Social welfare impacts of policy instruments or investment activities

       Figure 6 compares the effects of different policy instruments and investment actions on
total social welfare. The impacts on social welfare calculated by the model include the effects of
changes in total travel costs, total changes in rents, and total change in property values. Among
the individual policies and investment activities, road expansion would increase the value of social
welfare per person in the Greater Beirut Area by 200,000 to 300,000 LBP. All other policies and
investment activities would reduce social welfare by varying amounts.

5.2. Results from the simulations of the policy packages
            We have simulated the effects of three policy packages that contain a mix of demand
side policy instruments and supply side investment activities. The supply side activities include
the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) or ring road as described in section 4.2, as well as other investment
activity such as lane additions. These are combined with demand side instruments such as higher
parking fees or gasoline excise taxes, as described in section 4.1. The policy packages selected for
study were recommended for study in this paper by Ziad Nakat of the World Bank in Lebanon and
by Maya Abou Zeid.        They seem to have realistic chances of consideration by the city
administration and implementation, based on our understanding of discussions in Lebanon’s policy
circles.
      The first two policy packages involve the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system with 120 buses
described in section 4.2. This proposed BRT is 90%-180% faster than all existing modes of
transport. The targeted waiting time for the BRT bus will be 2-3 minutes. Additionally, bus
network extension will include 250 regular buses that will improve the waiting and access/egress
time by 10%-30%. Under Policy package 1, the parking tax increases by 25% in both MB and GB.
Thus, the parking cost for work trips increased from 1,466.02 LBP to 1,832.5 LBP in MB and
from 500 LBP to 625 LBP in GB. For non-work trips, parking cost increased from 984.25 LBP


                                                     34
to 1,230.3 LBP in MB and from 500 LBP to 625 LBP in GB. The purpose of the parking tax
increase is to discourage driving and by doing so divert even more car trips to the BRT.
         Policy package 2 accompanies the BRT with highway lane additions instead of the parking
tax increase. Since under any policy involving the BRT, road capacity is reduced to accommodate
the BRT, car congestion on the remaining roads would increase. While Policy package 1 attempts
to alleviate the higher congestion by increasing the parking tax, Policy package 2 attempts to
alleviate the congestion by adding more road capacity for cars.
         Policy package 3 is the ring road in GB described in section 4.2, accompanied with a 100%
increase in the excise tax on gasoline. This amounts to a 16.5% increase in the after-tax gasoline
price per liter.


5.2.1 Policy package 1: BRT buses, bus extension and parking fee increase
         We simulated this policy package by introducing BRT buses as an alternative mode of
transport which is 90%-180% faster than all existing modes of transport. The targeted waiting time
for BRT bus will be 2-3 minutes. Bus network extension will improve the waiting and
access/egress time by 10%-30%. The cost of implementing Policy 1 will be around 250 million
USD which is 2% of the nominal gross product in the base year. Parking fee is increased by 25%
in both MB and GB.
        After the introduction of Policy package 1, there is an increase in social welfare per consumer.
Welfare gains for workers and non-workers given in Table 5 are equivalent to 39% and 22% of
their gross annual income. Both have greatly benefitted from reduction in travel time and travel
cost for work and non-work trips. The speed of traffic improves by 139% and reduces congestion
by 19%. The aggregate travel time in the Greater Beirut region is reduced by 43% which is
equivalent to 24 minutes saved per trip.10
        There is an increase in public transit and parking tax revenue at the expense of gas tax
revenue. Even when people switched away to public transit, especially BRT buses, there is a
marginal increase in tax revenue as the tax rate is high enough to recover the loss due to revenue
reduction from private vehicles. Public transit revenue increased by 149% due to higher share of
public transit users. Gas tax revenue decreased by 74 LBP per consumer as people switched away
from gasoline driven modes to BRT buses. Also the decrease in gas tax revenue can be attributed

10
     Time saved per trip is total time saved divided by aggregate trips across all modes.

                                                            35
to parking tax being imposed on private vehicles which further reduces private vehicle use. All
these factors improved traffic speed and reduced gasoline consumption and VMT. Improved travel
time and reduced travel cost increased the disposable income for both workers and non-workers
which resulted in a marginal increase in non-work trips by 0.03% and overall trips by 0.01% given
in Table 5. Introduction of BRT created a mode share of 18% for BRT buses at the expense of all
other modes.
      From Table 6, we observe that some employment and population has moved into MB from
GB. There is also an increase in labor supply relative to its demand which reduced the wage in
MB but increased it in GB as labor supply decreases relative to its demand. In MB, rising rent
encouraged the construction for new residential floor space to accommodate rising population.
Whereas there is a negligible change in residential rent in GB and the stock of residential floor
space decreased due to loss in population. There is an increase in nominal and real output which
increased the demand for commercial floor space in both MB and GB. Increase in demand for
commercial floor space also increased the rent of commercial floor space. Beirut, as a region,
witnessed an increase in real estate value of 1.05% after the implementation of Policy package 1.


5.2.2. Policy package 2: BRT buses, bus extension and lane addition
      In Policy package 2, the parking tax in Policy package 1 is replaced by the construction of
additional lanes. This would increase the road capacity in GB by less than 1%. Such lane additions
will cost around 200 million USD i.e.1.5% of nominal gross product. So in total the cost of
implementing Policy package 2 will be 3.5% of nominal gross product.
      The welfare effects of both Policy package 1 and Policy package 2 are similar. The welfare
of both workers and non-workers has increased as shown in Table 5. The welfare gains are
equivalent to 40% and 22% of their gross annual income. The additional gains for workers under
Policy package 2 relative to Policy package 1 are because traveling by private vehicle is less time
consuming and less costly which is complementing the effect seen under the introduction of BRT
and the regular bus network expansion. There is an increase in public transit revenue from the gas
tax and the parking tax. Gas tax and parking tax revenue decreased by 74 LBP and 43 LBP as
people switched to public transit especially BRT bus. Higher disposable income due to lower travel
cost encouraged more non-work trips. Non-work trips under Policy package 2 are higher than
under Policy package 1 as the higher parking tax under Policy package 1 reduced disposable

                                                36
income. Under package 2, 18% of the total trips are made in BRT buses with an associated decrease
in VMT and gasoline consumption and is similar to Policy package 1 outcome. Traffic speed
improved, traffic congestion decreased and travel time saved per trip is equivalent to 23 minutes.
      From Table 6, we observe that both employment and population has moved into MB from
GB, similar to Policy package 1. There is also an increase in labor supply relative to its demand
which reduced the wage in MB but wage increases in GB as labor supply decreases relative to its
demand. In both MB and GB, residential rent has increased. The price effect of higher residential
rent will lower individual floor space demand. Also population in MB has increased which should
increase the demand for residential floor space. At the margin, the price effect of the rent increase
is greater than the effect of the population increase in MB. Such an effect discourages construction
of new residential floor space and hence residential stock decreased in MB. Residential stock
decreased in GB too due to the adverse price effect and the decrease in population. There is an
increase in nominal and real output which increased the demand for commercial floor space in
both MB and GB. The increase in the demand for commercial floor space also raised the rent of
commercial floor space. Beirut as a region witnessed an increase in real estate values of 1.33%
after the implementation of Policy package 2.


5.2.3. Policy package 3: Road capacity increase (Ring road, Peripherique) and gasoline tax
increase
      In Policy package 3, road capacity is increased in GB by building a ring road or
‘Peripherique’. It will increase the road supply by 4.1%. The construction cost of this new road
including expropriation of land is around 2 billion USD i.e. 15% of the nominal gross product of
the base year.
     After the implementation of Policy package 3, welfare is decreased as the cost of
implementation far outweighs its benefits. Welfare gained by workers is around 6% of annual
income and welfare lost by non-worker is lower than 1% of their non-wage income. On the one
hand, increasing road capacity in GB encouraged trips by private vehicles, but on the other hand,
higher gasoline tax discouraged traveling by private vehicle. At the margin, the result in Table 5
show that congestion has decreased whereas the mode choice shares remained more or less
unchanged. So the improvement in speed by 11% is not due to changes in mode choice in favor of
public transit but because of a decrease in non-work trips by 0.91% which reduced the overall

                                                 37
traffic. Imposition of the higher gasoline tax outweighs the decrease in trip cost through improved
traffic speed which reduces the disposable income and as such adversely affect the demand for
non-work trips. There is a small decrease in public transit and parking tax revenue of 1 LBP and 3
LBP per person respectively. Gas tax increased marginally by 16 LBP only. Improved speed
reduced VMT and gasoline consumption by 0.40% and 6% respectively. The travel time saved is
around 5 minutes per trip.
    In Table 6, we see that contrary to Policy packages 1 and 2, there is a decentralization of both
population and employment to GB. Wage in MB increased as labor supply decreased relative to
its demand, whereas wage decreases in GB. The higher gasoline tax lowered the disposable income
which caused the residential rent to fall. In MB, the favorable price effect of the rent decrease and
the higher wage outweighed the decrease in population. This resulted in an increase in the stock
of residential floor space at the margin. In GB, higher population along with lower residential rent
resulted in an increase in the stock of residential floor space. Fall in nominal gross product by
0.66% adversely affected the demand for commercial floor space and hence the commercial rent
fell marginally by 0.46% and 0.19% in MB and GB respectively. Beirut as a region experienced a
drop in real estate values after the implementation of Policy 3.
     Figure 7 shows the percentage change in mode choice share under each of the three policies,
while Figure 8 shows changes in traffic related variables and Figure 9 in economic variables.
Public transit includes regular bus, minibus and BRT bus. Under Policy package 1 and Policy
package 2 there is an increase in public transit ridership at the expense of private vehicle and taxi
service. Whereas there is a marginal increase in the share of private vehicle at the expense of public
transit and taxi service. In all the three policies, there is a decrease in gasoline consumption, VMT,
total travel time and an increase in traffic speed. The magnitude of changes is higher under Policy
package 1 and Policy package 2 in comparison to Policy package 3. Government revenue which
includes public transit revenue, parking tax revenue and gasoline tax revenue increases under all
the policy packages. Real estate values and gross product increased under Policy package 1 and
Policy package 2 but both of them decreased under Policy package 3.

      We did a further analysis in order to decompose the supply side from the demand side policy
effects under each policy package. Recall that Policy package 1 includes the introduction of BRT
buses together with a regular bus network extension on the supply side, and the demand side
instrument of the parking fee increase. Policy package 2 includes the supply side policy of the
introduction of BRT buses together with a regular bus network extension, and another supply side
measure, highway lane addition in suburban GB. Policy package 3 includes a different supply side
measure, the construction of a ring road in suburban GB, together with the increase in the gasoline
tax as a demand side policy instrument. In Tables 7 and Table 8, which correspond to Tables 5 and
6, there are two runs (columns) reported for each policy. The first of these runs calculates the
changes from the base situation when the supply side part of the policy is introduced, and the
second run calculates the additional change when the other part of the policy is added (demand
side for Policy package 1 and Policy package 3, and the other supply side part of Policy package
2).
      The results show that the supply side instruments are responsible for a very large part of the
improvements in total social welfare, and consumer welfare, while the demand side part of the
package causes small changes in either direction depending on the policy. This is because the
supply side policies and especially the BRT is very effective in directly speeding up public
transportation, and indirectly travel by car, by getting car traffic off the roads. The 25% parking
tax increase under Policy package 1 makes a small negative difference to consumer utility. This is

                                                    41
   because the parking tax increase is small and a poor substitute to pricing congestion with a
   Pigouvian congestion toll.

     Policy package 2 gives results very similar to policy package 1, except that in this case, the
highway land additions have a small but net positive effect on consumer CV, but a negative effect
on total welfare because of the cost of the additional lanes. The ring road under the third policy
package increases consumer welfare but much less than the BRT because it is much less effective
in alleviating congestion. Its total effect on welfare is negative because of its very high cost. The
gasoline tax doubling under the same package has a notable additional effect on consumer welfare
because it approximates well the effect of congestion pricing, much better than the parking tax
does under the first policy package.
     Table 9 presents the improvement in each of three different measures of congestion. The first
two measures are utilized mostly by engineers and planners and measure congestion in physical
terms. The first of these is the ratio of the composite traffic load per unit of road capacity or more
commonly known as the flow-to-capacity ratio. Table 9 shows that this ratio is a very high 9-10 in



                                                 43
the base case. It falls by 15-17.5% under the first two policy packages involving the BRT but falls
much less under the third package involving the ring road.
     The second measure is that popularized by the Texas Transportation Institute commonly
known as the TTI index. It measures congestion as the ratio of actual travel time to free-flow travel
time. We take free-flow travel time to be 100 km/hr. (62 miles per hour). The base value of this
measure is in the 7.4-10.6 range, but it improves by 44-50% under the BRT (packages 1 and 2)
and by only 6-13% under the ring road (package 3).
     The third measure is the aggregate congestion externality, favored by economists. It is the
total monetary value of the congestion delays caused by all traffic in LBP per year per consumer
in the model. In the base year this amounts to 283,399 LBP per consumer per year (approximately
189 $ US). The aggregate amount is equivalent to 2.11% of the Beirut region’s gross product and
3.96% of the per consumer income. Under the policy packages that include the BRT the aggregate
congestion externality falls by about 53% but by only 5% under Policy package 3.

     In summary, under policy packages 1 and 2, the BRT is very effective. It reduces congestion
as measured by the flow to capacity ratio by about 16%. It increases the Beirut region’s gross
product by 1.8% under package 1 and by 2.3% under package 2, implying an elasticity of gross
product to congestion of 11-14% under these policies. Consumer welfare under both packages
increases by about 4%, with almost all of this due to the BRT, implying an elasticity of consumer
utility to congestion of about 25%. The congestion externality is reduced by about 54%, implying
an elasticity of the congestion externality to congestion of 337.5%.


6. Conclusions
      Beirut, like most growing cities, faces the unwelcome effects of traffic congestion resulting
from a number of causes. It is critical to alleviate the problem by implementing effective policies,
based on weighing their overall economic cost and benefit to society. For this purpose, this study
applied an empirical model based on microeconomic theory that accounts for consumption and
production behavior related to transportation in the Greater Beirut Area (GBA). includes both
Beirut Municipality (MB) and Greater Beirut (GB), the location of suburbs and exurbs. The model
accounts for the origin and destination of trips and all their characteristics including trip type, trip
frequency, vehicle fuel type, transportation mode, travel time and cost, real estate information,
work and residential areas etc. We first simulated a number of supply and demand side measures
aimed to reduce congestion individually, and compared these policies in terms of their impacts on
the economy. This was followed by simulations of three plausible combination of these measures
as well as with additional activities, based on our understanding of discussions in Lebanon’s policy
circles and the options being evaluated by the City Administration.
   One of the key findings of the study is that individual supply side policies such as the expansion
of roads or the introduction of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system would be more beneficial for
Beirut compared to individual demand side policies such as an increased gasoline tax or higher
parking fees. Similarly, in the policy packages considered, most of the benefits come from the
supply-side components. This is because the supply side policies and especially the BRT are very
effective in directly speeding up public transportation, and indirectly speeding up travel by car by
getting car traffic off the roads. The introduction of the BRT with the expansion of the conventional
bus systems to feed the BRT reduces congestion, as measured by the flow to capacity ratio, by
about 16%. The reduction of costs caused by congestion would be more than 50%, while the gross

                                                  45
product of the Beirut region would increase by 1.8%. The introduction of the BRT and the
expansion of associated road network would have similar effects on congestion and on congestion
costs and would increase the Beirut region’s gross product by 2.3%. Social welfare, measured in
terms of consumer utility, would increase by about 4%. On the other hand, demand side
instruments such as increased gasoline taxes and parking fees, if implemented on their own, would
have negative economic consequences including slight drops in gross national product and in
welfare.
          Considering that most past studies on transport congestion management focused mostly on
demand side instruments, this study has brought additional insights comparing various policy
instruments on both the demand and the supply sides. Some limitations should be kept in mind
while interpreting the results and policy findings. Although we found that the BRT is a most
promising option for addressing congestion in Beirut, it may, in the future, cause problems of over-
crowding and other unintended negative social impacts.11 In the future, congestion might occur
again due to increased volume of vehicles and transport service demand as population of the city,
income level and vehicle ownership would increase. Therefore, demand side options have an
important role as complements to supply-sided measures in the longer-run. Another limitation is
that we had to work on a high level of aggregation dividing Beirut into just two zones. The results
would have been more precise had we divided the city into additional zones. However, detailed
data needed to divide the city more regions for a more detailed study are not currently available.

                                    Data and Assumptions
B1. Study Area and Base Year
       This study focuses on the capital Beirut and its suburbs, an area that is experiencing severe
congestion, attributed mostly to the large number of cars on the road entering Beirut every day. In
particular, the study area consists of two large zones: (i) Municipal Beirut – MB (districts 1, 2, and
3), and (ii) Greater Beirut – GB (districts 4, 5, and 6) excluding Municipal Beirut and extended to
Jounieh in the north and to Jiyyeh in the south, as shown in Figure B1. The congestion north of
Municipal Beirut extends as far as Jounieh at least, justifying the extension of Greater Beirut as a
study area till Jounieh. Moreover, a previous research study (Chalak et al., 2016) conducted a
transportation survey in 2013 among commuters residing and working in the same study area used
here, and so data from the Chalak et al. (2016) study are used as needed here. For this reason, 2013
is considered to be the base year of the current study even though not all the needed data items are
readily available for 2013.

B2. Travel Characterization


B2.1 Modes of Commuting
       The current modes of commuting in Lebanon are private car, bus (with capacity of 24-33
passengers), minibus or van (with capacity of 14 passengers), shared taxi or jitney (known locally
as service, with capacity of 4 passengers), private taxi, walk, bike, and motorcycle. The first four
modes are the most widely used for trip making in Beirut and constitute the focus of this study. A
recent study by IBI Group and TEAM (2009) reports the following modal split in the study area:
private car: 80.6%, taxi-Service: 6.7% (6% service and 0.7% private taxi), minibus or van (with
capacity of 14 passengers; often driver owned and operated): 10.9%, and bus: 1.75%. Most of the
buses and minibuses are operated by the private sector in an unregulated manner.

B2.2 Travel Attributes by Mode
       Travel time data for car trips in the peak hour is based on reported travel times “on a bad
day” from a 2013 survey (Chalak et al., 2016) which was conducted with car commuters who
reside and work in the study area, weighted by zone-to-zone number of AM peak hour trips at the
population level. The numbers were verified through a personal interview with Mr. Rami Semaan
from TMS Consult, 2016. No travel time data from a transport model were available for this study
due to the proprietary nature of such data. The in-vehicle travel time for the other modes is
computed by applying a factor to the car in-vehicle travel time, suggested by the public transport
revitalization study by IBI Group and TEAM (2009): 1.45 for bus, 1.25 for minibus, and 1.10 for
taxi-service. Average waiting times for bus and minibus (assumed to be half the headway) and
access/egress times are determined based on personal observation and measurements. We got the
average waiting time and access/egress time for taxi-service are obtained from the public transport
revitalization from the same study (see Table B1).

       The total cost of a one-way commute by car is the sum of the fuel cost and half the daily
parking rate. There are no tolls in Beirut. Car average daily parking costs were derived from the
2013 survey (Chalak et al., 2016), weighted by the number of trips to each of the districts to get
the averages for MB and GBA with further adjustment based on judgement. The average car fuel
efficiency is assumed to be 170 km/20 liters of fuel or 0.1176 liter/km driven as in the IBI Group
and TEAM (2009) study. Fuel cost (gasoline for passenger cars) is then computed as the product


                                                87
of the fuel efficiency, the gasoline price of 33,000 LBP/20 liters (or 1,650 LBP/liter) in 2013, and
the distance to work (km). The bus and minibus fares are the standard fares in operation. Taxi-
service fare is based on the service fare (which is decided based on trip distance) since the private
taxi share of trips is very small. Distance is based on reported distance from the 2013 survey,
weighted as in the method used to calculate travel time. The average speed of traffic is calculated
as the average distance divided by the average in-vehicle travel time by the corresponding mode
and verified using several sources.

B2.3 Car Type, fuel type, unit fuel consumption and prices
      According to the Association of Car Importers in Lebanon for the year 2014 (UNDP/First
Climate/ECODIT, 2016), the distribution of white plate passenger cars in Lebanon by car size12 is
as follows: 16.24% small cars, 51.35% midsize cars, and 32.41% large cars. 51.25% of cars are
manufactured before year 2000, while 48.75% are manufactured after 1999. Passenger cars run on
gasoline. Buses run on diesel and minibuses run on gasoline. Based on data as of June 2013, fuels
prices are 1,650 LBP/liter and 1,250 LBP/liter for gasoline and diesel, respectively. Buses and
minibuses have a fuel consumption rate of about 0.25 liter/km (MoE/UNDP/GEF, 2015). Based
on IBI Group and TEAM (2009), the car occupancy rate is 1.7 (including driver), the bus
occupancy rate is 11.20 (excluding driver), the minibus occupancy rate is 5.93 (excluding driver),
and the shared and exclusive taxi occupancy rate is 1.18 (excluding driver). Based on the same
study, the distribution of peaking factors is presented in Error! Reference source not found..

  Small vehicles are classified as vehicles with weight < 1 ton, engine size ≤ 1.4 liters, engine output < 15 HP. Midsize
vehicles are those with weight 1 to 1.5 tons, engine size 1.4 to 2.3 liters, engine output 15 to 24 HP. Large vehicles
are those with weight > 1.5 tons, engine size > 2.3 liters, engine output > 24 HP.

B2.4 Number trips by mode and origin and destinations
      AM peak hour trips (from 7-8 AM) by car are based on data used in Chalak et al. (2016).
Assuming that the same number of trips will be made in the PM peak hour in the reverse direction,
and using a peaking factor of 6.71% for the AM peak as a percentage of daily trips, the daily trip
patterns by car are derived. Person trips are obtained from car trips using an average car occupancy
of 1.7 as mentioned above. Total daily person trips by all motorized modes is obtained knowing
that car person trips constitute 80.6% of all trips in the study area (IBI Group and TEAM, 2009).
Finally, work and made by residents in the study area are obtained knowing the total employment
in the study area and number of jobs occupied by non-residents, and non-work trips are then the
balance between daily trips for all purposes and daily work trips (see Table B2a). External trips
made by non-residents and by residents of the study area (with one trip end inside the study area
and another trip end outside the study area) are obtained by applying factors to the internal trips
made by residents, where these factors are derived from DAR-IAURIF (2005). The percentage of
jobs in the study area occupied by non-residents and the distribution of non-resident trips by work
or non-work purposes are obtained from Harris and IBI Group (2003). The external trip matrices
are presented in Table B2(b).

B3. Socioeconomic and demographic data
       Data on the income of employed individuals and on household income is obtained from
the Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) from its Living Conditions Survey that was
conducted in 2007 (CAS, 2007). The population and employment estimates were supplied by Mr.
Rami Semaan from TMS Consult and have been estimated based on 2014 data (excluding Syrian
refugees and Palestinian refugee camps population). Missing data for certain zones of the study
area were inferred based on population and employment density maps. The number of workers
and non-workers is inferred from the work and non-work trip patterns discussed before and
validated with CAS (2007). The number of households is calculated given the population estimate
and the average household size from CAS (2007). The socioeconomic and demographic data are
presented in Table B3.

        There are 18 bus/minibus lines serving Beirut and GB and some outlying areas, most of
which are unregulated and privately owned. Based on personal observation as well as on Farhat
(2015), we categorize bus/minibus operation into three types as follows: (i) Case 1 (14 lines):
There is one main operator of the bus line, and bus drivers are employees for the main operator.
(ii) Case 2 (3 lines): The bus/minibus vehicles are privately owned or rented by individual drivers
who pay a parking fee for parking operators. The revenues from ticket sales constitute the daily
revenue for the drivers; (iii) Case 3 (1 line): Similar to case 2, but the drivers do not pay a parking
fee.

        For a Case 1 line, the costs and revenues pertain to the main operator of the line. For a Case
2 or Case 3 line, the costs and revenues are those that pertain to the individual drivers on these
lines; they are summed up across vehicles operating on a daily basis on a certain line to arrive at a
total cost and revenue figure for the corresponding line. A number of assumptions are employed
in the calculation of costs and revenues, based on interviews with bus/minibus drivers, articles
available online, and judgment to match some controls (e.g. the total number of buses operating
on a line). These assumptions pertain to type of vehicle used (bus or minibus) on a line, headway,
hours of operation, number of round trips per day, average route speed, number of days of
operation per month, and various operational cost and revenue related parameters. Given the route
length, the average route speed and headway, and number of shifts per day on a given bus/minibus,
the estimated number of buses/minibuses on each line are estimated in Table B6.

       Based on interviews we conducted with bus and minibus drivers, the cost of a new bus
(generally Mitsubishi) is around $94,000. And the cost of a new minibus is around $37,000
(excluding the cost of the red plate).

B5. Land Use and Real Estate Data

     Table B7 summarizes for each of MB and GB the total area of these districts, the area
occupied by buildings by type, the unusable land (including existing roads), and the land area that
can be further developed in each district. The total land area is obtained from a GIS file of the
zones in the study area (with the addition of the area of reclaimed land in the sea in Municipal
Beirut as well as in Greater Beirut). The land area occupied by buildings was computed using
Google Earth as the plan view/roof area, excluding parking lots, green spaces, and any open spaces
within a building. Some of the remaining land area that is not yet developed is unusable for further
development such as public parks, graveyards, rivers, the airport field, and the golf course.
Palestinian refugee camps were not included in the “unusable land” because their areas were
incorporated under built up spaces. The total unusable area also includes empty spaces within
buildings and setbacks which were estimated using an average investment ratio for each zone based

on the "Building Law and Regulations in Lebanon" issued in 1995 by the Order of Engineers and
Architects (OEA). Note that the residential category includes land area occupied by Palestinian refugee
camps. The latter constitute 18,416 m2 in Municipal Beirut and 867,048 m2 in Greater Beirut.

Land value and rental prices: Land value price estimates were derived based on interviews with
real estate agents. The figure for MB is relatively high and this is driven mostly by very high prices
in the Beirut Central District and seafront area of Municipal Beirut. Purchase prices of residential
apartments were obtained from RAMCO for MB (based on analysis by RAMCO of 345 residential
buildings under construction in Municipal Beirut in 2015 as reported in Blominvest Bank, 2015;
Delmendo, 2015; iLoubnan.info, 2015). The prices for GB are obtained from INFOPRO Research,
who compiled based on limited data for selected Beirut suburbs but these pricing data were
validated through interviews with real estate agents. Based on personal communication with
RAMCO researchers and other real estate agents, the annual rental values were estimated to be,
on average, around 3% of the purchase price of an apartment. All pricing data are for year 2013.
For office buildings, rental prices were obtained from a real estate agent for MB and was validated
with sources.13 The rental values of office buildings in GB vary between 100 and 150 $/m2/year,
and we use the average of this range as representative of office rental prices in Greater Beirut.

The average dwelling size for first floor apartments under construction in Beirut was obtained from
RAMCO, and for GB from interviews with several real estate agents based on the most currently
sellable apartments. The value for MB is significantly higher than that for GB due to the fact that

high income neighborhoods in Municipal Beirut (the sea front, Solidere, Ain Mreisseh, Ramleh
Baida, etc.) have apartments with larger areas because their market targets are buyers from the
Gulf; many of these high-end apartments remain vacant and they drive upwards the average size
of apartments in Municipal Beirut. Data on housing and rental prices are summarized in Table B8.
