The difference in teacher salaries in public and private
schools in Ajeromi-Ifelodun are quite stark. Indeed,
according to the result of the World Bank survey
conducted in Ajeromi-Ifelodun, certified public primary
teachers receive a yearly average survey of ₦120,430,
while certified private primary teachers receive
₦11,642—or ten times less. Certified public upper
secondary teachers are paid, on average, ₦72,667 a year,
while certified private upper secondary teachers are paid
₦20,357 per year.

Access to capital is a major constraint for private
schools.

The World Bank survey found that 51 percent of schools
planned to borrow money in the next academic year.

schools are either not registered or nor fully registered
and therefore operate outside prescribed regulations. In
fact, only 15 schools, or a mere two percent, declared
having paid three types of fees and only six schools (less
than one percent) declared having paid four types of
fees. And while legislation in the state officially lists five
types of required registration and/or approval fees, only
six schools declared having paid four types (figure 17).

Box 4. Private School Registration Status in Lagos State

  Unapproved schools are not recognized by the Lagos State government and operate outside the law. They do not appear in
  official statistics. Their students may not sit for national exams and leave school without a recognized qualification. Their sites
  have never been inspected and could pose a health and safety risk to students. Niether are they subject to inspections to ensure
  educational quality. Less than 4 in 10 teachers at unapproved schools have undergone teacher training. These schools may
  charge lower fees than approved schools, however, and may consequently be more affordable for the poorest households. Some
  43 percent of private schools in Ajeromi-Ifelodun were unapproved in 2014.
  Schools in the process of approval have begun, but not completed, the certification process. As such, their students may
  encounter similar disadvantages to those in unapproved schools. Approval costs US$251 in registration fees, excluding the cost
  of purchasing land; and constructing classrooms, sanitation blocks, specialist teaching rooms, and a library; and purchasing
  equipment. To maintain approval status, schools pay between US$75 and US$500 per year. Approval is a costly process that may
  impact the price of tuition and compulsory nontuition fees. Just over 46 percent of schools in Ajeromi-Ifelodun are in the process
  of approval.
  Approved schools have successfully completed all official registration processes, including administrative procedures, site
  inspection, and payment of all required registration fees. These schools are recognized by the state government and their data
  is included in official records. They are subject to laws regarding all aspects of their operation, liable to pay taxes and fees, and
  required to undergo regular inspections to ensure educational quality. Approved schools are more likely to be granted loans
  should they wish to invest in developing facilities or capacity. Students at approved schools are allowed to sit for national exams,
  which lead to recognized qualifications, and more likely to be taught by qualified teachers. Due to the relative scarcity of
  approved schools, approved private schools may charge higher tuition and compulsory nontuition fees, and thus may be out of
  reach of poor students.

above, the country receives a score between 1 and 4,
representing four levels of private sector engagement: 1
(Latent), 2 (Emerging), 3 (Established), or 4 (Advanced).
A score of Established is accepted as a desirable
minimum outcome for each policy goal. Beyond this, it is
advised that countries aspire to the Advanced level in
those areas that most contribute to the national vision or
priorities for education.

final development level for the policy goal, based on the
following scale:
•   Latent:               1.00 – 1.50
•   Emerging:             1.51 – 2.50
•   Established:          2.51 – 3.50
•   Advanced:             3.51 – 4.00

Education systems are likely to be at different levels of
development in different areas. For example, a system
may be Emerging in Holding Schools Accountable but
Advanced in Promoting Diversity of Supply. While
intuition suggests that it is probably better to be further
along in as many areas as possible, the evidence is
unclear as to whether it is necessary to be functioning at
Advanced levels for all policy goals. Therefore, one might
view the Established level as a desirable minimum
outcome to achieve in all areas, but aspire to levels
beyond that only in those areas that most contribute to
the national vision or priorities for education. In line with
these considerations, the ratings generated by the
rubrics are not meant to be additive across policy goals.
That is, they are not meant to be added to create an
overall rating for engaging the private sector.

          The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
          initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
          systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
          associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
          with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
          teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
          accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
          their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
          all children and youth learn.

          This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of engaging
          the private sector in education.
