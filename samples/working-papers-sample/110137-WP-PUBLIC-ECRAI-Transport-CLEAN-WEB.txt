Key Messages


Roads are a key asset for Africa. They connect villages to economic centers, people to hospitals, children to
schools and goods to markets facilitating trade. This report examines the implications of climate change for
Africa’s road connectivity, and practical steps that can be taken now to minimize the associated risks. The
scope of the report includes 2.8 million km of roads throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, with a special focus on
new road construction outlined in the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), an African
Union facilitated initiative to enhance trans-boundary connectivity through the continent. The main
conclusions of the report are:

Adequate road maintenance is the most critical and most efficient way of reducing the impact of a changing
climate on the road system. In the absence of an adequate maintenance regime, the damage caused by
climactic events is exacerbated. The uncertainty related to climate change further reinforces this dynamic.
Thus, maintenance of pavements and sealing activities; regular maintenance of bridges, culverts and drainage
structures to ensure they are functional and not obstructed; maintenance and improvement of slope
protection works; and systematic assessments to identify and incrementally address vulnerable and critical
road sections are the first defense to climate risks.

This report finds that even assuming adequate maintenance regimes (thereby standardizing the analysis across
countries), climate change will cause substantial disruptions in network connectivity and increases in repairs
and rehabilitation costs. In fact, most African countries are well below maintenance standards, which will make
climate change impacts even more severe. This suggests that adequate, climate-resilient maintenance should
be a key priority as countries operationalize their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and should be
supported by climate finance when available.

Simply ignoring climate change is not an option. The report shows that climate change is likely to lead to a
shortening of roads rehabilitation life-cycle, which, in addition to maintenance, usually entails resurfacing
every 20 years. The shortened life-cycle is likely to lead to steep increases in maintenance and periodic
rehabilitation costs. In the worst climate scenarios, stress imposed on the roads by precipitation can lead to
rehabilitation costs 10 times higher (compared to historical climate conditions); stress imposed by flooding
can lead to a 17 times increase.

In addition, climate change can lead to large increases in the disruption time of the network: in the worst
climate scenarios, up to 2.5 times historic disruption due to extreme temperatures; for the temperature
stressor; 76% higher due to precipitation; and 14 times higher due to flooding.
Proactive adaptation in response to temperature increase is a no regret option. Modifying the design in
response to an anticipated higher temperature is a low or no-regret option for paved roads in virtually all
countries and the vast majority of climate scenarios, including both the PIDA transboundary corridors and the
planned expansion/upgrade of the national networks. The reason is that the savings accrued over the road life
cycle more than offset the higher construction costs, even if the measures are adopted now, before significant
temperature increases are experienced. In other words, the report shows that it is already appropriate to
design road infrastructure for the higher temperatures that climate change will bring. Not doing so may cause
the need to repair damages related to higher temperature.

                                                      vii
The case for proactive adaptation in response to precipitation is not as clear cut, and needs to be assessed case
by case. Because of the fundamental uncertainty regarding future climate, it is not possible to be as definite
on how to proactively design for precipitation. Rainfall varies all over the continent, but in several countries
(e.g. Angola, Nigeria, Botswana, Togo, South Sudan, Mozambique, Benin, and Cameroon), it is clear that even
moderate changes in the climate will induce significant precipitation-related disruption. In these countries, it
would be appropriate to start proactively adapting the road system. In other countries, more detailed analysis
is needed to identify where, when and how to invest in resilience most appropriately. Some roads in some
areas may well already benefit also from pro-active adaptation.

Better information on the benefits of avoiding climate-related disruption can inform decisions on proactive
adaptation. This report develops a methodology to evaluate the merits of proactive adaptation in the context
of an uncertain future climate. The methodology can be applied in a straightforward manner to decisions about
specific investments, once more granular information is available on:

    •   the lifetime cost of road assets;
    •   the value of the freight and passenger traffic expected to use those assets,
    •   the criticality of the road segment on the one hand and the level of network redundancy on the other
        hand, and
    •   how climate stressors (precipitation, flooding, extreme temperatures) are likely to affect both the road
        asset and its use.

This study evaluated the economics of engineering solutions to build resilience (such as increasing the drainage
capacity of a road; better crowning a road to enable water to the sides; hardening river banks to avoid flooding;
using road binders better adapted to extreme temperatures). This focus is justified by the need to avoid locking
road projects in climate-vulnerable engineering solutions that could be very costly to reverse later. Other
adaptation options that African countries could assess, in terms of their cost-effectiveness of reducing climate
risk, include:

    •   Sector and spatial planning - positioning roads where they are not likely to be harmed by climate;
        building-in redundancies, i.e., multiple ways to get to the same place
    •   Non-engineering solutions - traffic control, like restricting trucking on certain roads; rerouting traffic;
        regularly cleaning the drains and tunnels
    •   Enabling environment – policies and regulations that facilitate the professional management of road
        systems, including good contracting, regular maintenance, and inspection.

Overview
Africa’s Road Infrastructure: A Vital but Vulnerable Asset
Economic growth is highly dependent on the quality, quantity, and accessibility of a country’s
infrastructure services. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), inadequate road infrastructure is increasingly
seen as an obstacle to achieving poverty reduction and economic development goals. According
to the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD, Foster and Briceno-Garmendia, 2010), only
one-third of rural inhabitants live within two kilometers of an all-season road – the lowest
accessibility in the developing world (World Bank, 2010b).
In recognition of the urgent need to address SSA’s infrastructure gap, the Program for
Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) was launched to provide a common framework for
African stakeholders to build the infrastructure necessary for more integrated transport, energy,
ICT, and trans-boundary water networks. Endorsed by African Heads of State in January 2012, PIDA
aims to boost trade, spark growth, and create jobs. In the roads sector, PIDA aims to address the
low density and poor condition of SSA’s road networks to increase connectivity and reduce
transport costs. The PIDA Priority Action Plan (PAP) identifies a subset of priority infrastructure
programs designed to address the most urgent infrastructure deficits. The roads component as a
subset of PIDA PAP makes up about half of the transport sector allocation, or $16.3 billion.
Together with energy projects, PIDA transport investments represent approximately 95% of the
total cost of the PIDA PAP, demonstrating the critical need for investment in these sectors.
In addition to the PIDA program, many SSA countries have their own road network investment
plans. Research conducted for this study identified national road investment plans that include an
additional 261 projects across 30 countries, with an estimated investment cost of US$45 billion.
The combined “PIDA+” reference investment scenario, comprising PIDA and the national
investment plans, therefore represents an approximate combined capital investment rate of
US$4.6 billion per year, for a total of US$78 billion.
The PIDA program is a vital component of Africa’s development strategy. Yet it is also essential
that the forthcoming investment in SSA’s roads take into account the very real risk of climate
change. Roads are particularly vulnerable to climate stressors such as increased temperature and
precipitation and flooding. For paved roads, increased temperature leads to accelerated aging of
the pavement binder and rutting of asphalt. For paved and gravel roads, increased precipitation
and flooding lead to reduced load-carrying capacity and overtopping of roads, among other
impacts.
The effects of climate stressors on road infrastructure, which include both increased maintenance
and a potentially shorter useful life between rehabilitation cycles, also give rise to indirect effects,
such as disruption of unimpeded travel of people and goods, either because the road surface is


                                                   1
damaged or destroyed, or because it is in the process of being repaired. These disruptions in turn
affect economic activity and productivity.
Fortunately, there are effective ways of adapting new roads and modifying existing roads to make
them more resilient to climate change. The challenge is in determining the most cost-effective and
appropriate adaptation pathway given the high degree of uncertainty in climate projections.
Although a vast body of scientific evidence indicates that the climate of the future will be very
different from that of the past, climate models often disagree on the specific changes in
temperature and precipitation at a given location. This uncertainty complicates adaptation
planning, but as this book shows, the uncertainty can be managed, and steps necessary to achieve
resilient roads can, and should, be taken as investments in these critical assets move forward.
The key messages of the report at that enhancing maintenance of existing roads is vital priority,
made more important by the risks that climate change may make these roads unpassable without
a renewed commitment to maintaining roads as a vital asset in economic development; that new
and many existing paved roads need to incorporate a new standard for achieving resilience to the
effects of the forecast higher temperatures, because as this report shows such a new standard is
cost-effective; and that country and local road planners need to carefully consider a strategic and
targeted approach, on the most vulnerable and well-traveled roads in their systems, to further
updating road construction and maintenance standards to address vulnerabilities to the effects of
increased intensity of precipitation and flooding.
The goal of this study is first to quantify the cost of climate change to the African roads sector, and
second to assist decision makers in identifying the most cost-effective adaptation approach. To
this end, the study uses detailed analysis of climate impacts for each of a wide array of possible
future climates, combined with decision analysis techniques, to identify how to maximize the cost-
effectiveness of investing in infrastructure resilience plans in advance of knowing how the future
climate will unfold.

How Should We Evaluate Adaptation Options for Africa’s Road Network?
The network of roads analyzed in this study is referred to as the “PIDA+” network, and includes
both current road and planned projects from PIDA and country-level projects. Figure O.1 outlines
the approach taken in the study, which consists of five main steps. The first steps include
assembling the last two generations of United Nations, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change vetted climate change scenarios and compiling data on the PIDA+ network.




                                                  2
Figure O.1. Study approach




Next, the study uses the Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS – see Box O.1 below) to
evaluate the climate change impacts to the PIDA+ network under the following scenarios:

   •   Reactive Response (Risks of Inaction): In this case, no proactive measures are taken to
       prepare the roads for climate change, and climate change and extreme events damage
       roads. Climate change impacts are quantified in terms of increased maintenance costs,
       relative to those that would be incurred under current climate, and incremental road
       disruption costs.
   •   Proactive Adaptation (Investments in Adaptation): Anticipatory measures are taken to
       mitigate the effects of climate change and take advantage of any opportunities. Climate
       change impacts are quantified in terms of up-front costs of design changes, reductions in
       subsequent needs for repeated repairs and maintenance, and reductions in road
       disruption.

The analysis assumes throughout that the timing, management and financing of periodic
maintenance is adequate and in accordance with established engineering standards. While this
may seem at odds with the reality of most of the region (where maintenance is substantially
underfunded), the assumption is justified because it allows to standardize the modeling across
countries, and to focus on the incremental maintenance cost caused by climate change. However,
this does not imply that closing the current financing gap for maintenance is not important. To the
contrary, mobilizing additional resources for maintenance will be a key, no-regret first step in
reducing countries’ vulnerability to climate change. The reason is that if countries continue to
under-fund maintenance, they will be even more exposed to climate change than the present
analysis concludes.
Comparing the lifetime cost of the road assets (construction, maintenance, repairs and
rehabilitation) under the reactive and proactive response provides an assessment of the financial
case for taking adaptation action. If the higher construction cost of adapting to climate change is

                                                3
more than offset by the lower annual cost for maintenance, rehabilitation and repairs, than
adaptation makes financial sense.
However, the financial case for adaptation depends on the climate change scenario considered.
The case will be stronger under scenarios of more severe climate change (as there will be higher
cost savings over the lifecycle of the project); and weaker in scenarios of less pronounced change
(smaller savings, relative to the upfront adaptation cost). For some road projects, there will be net
financial savings over the assets’ lifecycle in all climate scenarios. In these cases, the case for
adaptation is unequivocal.
But considering only the perspective of life-time costs may be limited, as it leaves out the fact that
more resilient road assets could shorten the down time of the transport network when climate
stressors hit. A shorter downtime can reduce the disruption of supply chains, or restore the
accessibility of schools and hospitals.
Therefore, the last step in the study is to consider both the financial benefits and the benefits of
reduced disruption time in a decision-making context called a “breakeven analysis.” This is
particularly important in projects where the financial case for adaptation is sensitive to the climate
scenario considered. In some of these cases, the time-saving benefits of adaptation may be more
robust to different climate scenarios. In particular, for high-traffic roads, even milder climate
change can cause important disruptions in the movement of people and goods. In these situations,
the balance may be tilted again in favor of adopting more climate resilient engineering solutions,
in spite of the higher construction costs incurred when following a proactive adaptation response.

 Box O.1. The Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS)
 The Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS) is a software model that integrates expertise from
 researchers in civil and environmental engineering, water resources, architecture, international
 development, and economics. It is a quantitative, engineering-based analysis tool to understand the
 impacts of climate change on current and future road, bridge, and other infrastructure
 (http://www.clicslab.org/ipss.html).

 Costs are assessed based on two approaches. First, a reactive “no adaptation” approach which analyzes
 a changing future climate on existing road design standards. This is compared to a proactive “adaptation”
 approach which reduces future risk and damages by changing design standards at upgrades or re-
 construction. Both maintenance and new construction/re-construction costs are provided. Stressor-
 response relationships are based on based on a number of published sources including engineering
 research and materials studies.
 See Box O.2 below for a more detailed explanation of the stressor-response functions used in this study.


A similar analysis is conducted to assess climate impacts and adaptation options for Africa’s
bridges. Because no inventory of Africa’s bridges exists, the study developed a new, “synthetic”
inventory based on road crossings in the existing road and river networks of Sub-Saharan African


                                                    4
countries. Because there is limited information on the size, construction material, and condition
of these bridges, the bridge component of the study addresses risks of inaction and the potential
for climate adaptation but does not assess disruption effects.
Climate Change Projections

Climate change is projected to bring about substantial changes across SSA in temperature and
precipitation (see Figure O.2 for the projected change in five sample countries). The countries
were selected based on their present-day climates, which represent the range of climates found
across SSA. As shown in the figure, temperature is projected to rise uniformly across the climate
models and countries. The projected change in mean precipitation is more uncertain, and varies
substantially across countries.
Figure O.2. Projected changes in mean annual temperature and precipitation in SSA in 2050




Note: In each country, each dot denotes an annual representation of climate. In the precipitation panel, the vertical
zero line corresponds to current (recent historical) mean annual precipitation. Dots to the right of the historical value
refer to projections of wetter climate; dots to the left indicate projections of drier climate.

The uncertainty in future climate is an important rationale for adopting the scenario-based
analysis methods used in this study. Although considering many possible climate futures
complicates the interpretation of our results, it is important to recognize that failure to consider a
broad range of possible climate futures in planning climate-sensitive road infrastructure could lead
to large over- or under-investments in climate resilience.

Characterizing Africa’s Current and Future Roads – the PIDA+ Network
The PIDA+ network represents the planned roads investment in SSA through 2030, plus all current
roads, totaling over 2.8 million km across the continent. The study draws on data from existing
infrastructure investment plans (e.g., PIDA), as well as other regional initiatives and country-level
master plans to characterize the scope of new road investments. But the PIDA+ network also
includes existing roads. In total, the PIDA network evaluated in the study includes 11 trans-

                                                           5
boundary road corridor projects, comprising 111 individual road segment investments, with a total
projected investment of approximately US$16.3 billion. The “new” portion of the PIDA+ inventory
includes an additional 261 projects across 30 countries, with an estimated investment cost of
US$45 billion. Figure O.3 presents the PIDA PAP projects included in the study across the four SSA
regions used by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).

    Risks of Inaction

    The projected changes in temperature, precipitation, and flooding throughout SSA will have
    substantial effects on the PIDA+ network. Figure O.4 presents the estimated reactive response
    costs associated with each climate stressor (see Box O.2 for details of the climate effects modeled).
    Specifically, the figure shows the costs of conducting maintenance on the PIDA+ road network
    between major rehabilitation cycles in response to climate-induced damages, to restore roads to
    their pre-climate change condition. Periodic rehabilitation costs are included in the baseline,
    “historical climate” costs.
    As shown, the flooding stressor leads to relatively higher increases in costs relative to historic costs
    across the regions for both the PIDA+ network and PIDA PAP projects. Cost increases are
    particularly high in the Central and Western regions. 1

    impacts are likely to be higher than indicated). The vertical axis is normalized (at 100) to the historic (no-climate-
    change) costs. Bars that are higher than the 100 line represent costs of climate change relative to the optimal costs
    of maintenance for current climate; bars below the line indicate potential savings. Box indicates the range of costs
    over the 25th to the 75th percentile of climate change scenarios; line in box represents the mean value; and whiskers
    extending from box refer to the 5th and 95th percentile of costs over climate change scenarios.

    Note that recent global agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions might be expected to reduce these risks of
    inaction for the road network, when they are fully realized. But because it will take time for the reductions associated
    with GHG mitigation to take effect, those measures are less effective than might be expected, at least through the
    2050 time horizon of the study. Adaptation action is likely to be needed, even if carbon emissions are dramatically
    reduced.

   Box O.2. Summary Description of Impacts of Climate Change on Roads
   In this study roads were analyzed for climate impacts from three specific climate stressors:
   temperature, precipitation, and flooding. The lifetime cost of each road segment was analyzed using
   a stressor-response method to evaluate, relative to a baseline of historical climate, the incremental
   cost attributable to climate change.
   The basic impact estimate approach operates as follows. When a climate stressor reaches a level
   where it exceeds the climatic design parameters for the road, damage is incurred. In general, we
   assume that roads are built to historical climate standards. Where the historical standards are
   exceeded, damages are incurred through increased maintenance activities necessary to preserve
   the integrity of the road for its original design lifespan. A summary of how climate stressors affect
   paved and unpaved roads is provided in the table below. Note that each of the three climate
   stressors affects a different component of a road. For paved roads, for example, temperature affects
   the surface integrity, precipitation affects the subgrade, and flooding can wash away the entire road
   system. Because these impacts, and the reactive repairs and proactive adaptations options taken in
   response to the impacts, are independent, both the impacts and the adaptation strategies are
   analyzed separately throughout the book.
   Roads were classified as “paved” or “gravel” surface, meaning bitumen surface or not, respectively.
   Additionally, roads were classified within the surface type as: primary, secondary or tertiary based
   upon design parameters, construction design and other characteristics; these distinctions imply

Figure O.5 presents the reactive response costs at the country level, relative to the lifetime cost
incurred under historical climate. Variation across countries is dependent on: the regional
distribution of climate changes; the historical climate (because road infrastructure is assumed to

                                                    9
be built to withstand current climate, making areas that are relatively cool or dry potentially more
vulnerable as climate gets hotter and/or wetter), and the distribution of road types, with unpaved
roads typically being more vulnerable.

Note: The chart provides an indication of the impact of climate change relative to the optimal maintenance for a
historic climate (because actual road maintenance is typically underfunded relative to the optimal maintenance cost,
impacts are likely to be higher than indicated). The blue line shows the country-specific historic (no-climate-change)
costs. Blue dot shows the 5th percentile (most benign) of costs over climate change scenarios; orange dot shows the
result for the 95th percentile (most damaging) of costs.

In addition to increased maintenance costs, the reactive response approach is projected to result
in a high degree of disruption to the PIDA+ network. The analysis quantifies disruption in terms of
out-of-service days for roads in the network – roads must be out of service when climate change
damages the road, to allow repair crews to fix the road and make them passable. The reactive
response to changes in precipitation alone, for example, results in an estimated 46-88 million
disruption days under different climate scenarios, compared to 50 million days for the historic
climate. The increase in disruption for the reactive response mode for the worst expected future
climate could be as much as 2.5 times historic climate disruption levels for the temperature
stressor; 76% higher for the precipitation stressor; and 14 times higher for the flooding stressor
(Figure O.6).

                                                         10
Disruption of the Africa road network clearly results in substantial economic costs, as goods and
people are prevented from moving freely or engaging in economic activity. A single day of
disruption likely restricts many person-days of activity, though this effect may be mitigated in
places where there is a high degree of road network redundancy. The typical rule of thumb for
valuation of traffic disruption is to use 50 percent of the daily wage as a proxy for the lost
opportunity cost of time – using reasonable valuation estimates, then, disruption might lead to
additional damages in the billions to tens of billions of dollars, associated with individual days of
road closure for repairs.

Note: The chart presents results for cumulative road disruption times across climates in million days of disruption,
across all SSA. Green triangle indicates disruption estimated for a historic climate. Box indicates the range from the
25th to the 75th percentile of disruptions days over climate change scenarios; line in box represents the mean value;
and whiskers extending from box indicate the range of disruption days over the 5th to the 95th percentile of climate
change scenarios.

Even this value, however, excludes the broader macroeconomic implications of restricted travel
and economic activity that extends to multiple economic sectors (e.g., associated with spoilage of
agricultural products or lost tourism revenue). Two country scale examples support the
importance of disruption to African economies. In Mozambique, analysts estimated that transport
disruption associated with climate change could cost the economy roughly $2.5 billion/year over
the 2010-2050 period, compared to a current annual GDP of $15.6 billion. (Arndt et al., 2012). In
South Africa, a similar analysis found that transport disruption could cost 0.8% of GDP (with a
range of 0.1 to 2.6% across climate futures) by 2050; South Africa’s current GDP is over $350
billion. The cumulative cost over the 2015 to 2050 period (5% discount rate) would be $16 billion
(mean across climate forecasts), with a range of $1.5 to $55 billion (Cullis et al., 2015).

Effects of Climate Change on Bridges
Climate change also has significant impacts on Africa’s bridge network. Although no
comprehensive inventory of bridges exists for the continent, this study estimates there are
approximately 330,000 bridges across SSA. Based on the size of their respective road crossings,
approximately 230,000 (69%) of these bridges are small (associated with tertiary roads), 76,000
(23%) are medium sized (associated with secondary roads), and 26,000 (8%) are large (associated
with primary roads).
The mean estimated cost for the PIDA+ bridge inventory associated with a climate change reactive
response is $18 billion for 2015-50 (6% discount rate – corresponds to the mean cost over the
distribution of climate change scenarios), which compares to a historical climate cost of about $5
billion (Figure O.7). Costs vary by climate scenario, however, with the 5th percentile climate
showing costs of $7.6 billion, a 50% increase over historic costs, and the 95th percentile showing
costs of just over $35 billion, 7 times the historic cost. Climate change therefore very clearly
presents a substantial risk to Africa’s bridges, across all projected future climates, and to the vital
connectivity they provide for the transport network.
In some countries, bridge adaptation may also make good economic sense. The mean value of
savings is slightly negative in several of the countries analyzed; however, disruption times are often
much higher for bridges than for roads because of the critical nature of bridge crossings in road
networks. So when the cost of disruption time is included in the analysis, it is reasonable to
conclude that proactive fortifying of bridge construction will be cost effective, although this will
need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The Value of Adapting Africa’s Roads to Climate Change
Adaptation has two major benefits: a potential reduction in lifetime road assets costs
(construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation); and a reduction in disruption time (less time
wasted in moving goods and people).
The saving in assets’ life-time cost is sometimes sufficient to support broad application of
adaptation measures. For example, the adoption of temperature resistant road surfaces for the
PIDA network makes sense on financial grounds alone, even without considering time disruption
reduction co-benefits (Figure O.8, Panel A).
However, in other cases the lifetime cost savings argument alone is not sufficient to justify
adaptation across the full spectrum of possible climate futures. This is the case for the
precipitation and flooding stressors in the PIDA roads (Figure O.8, Panel A); and for all three
stressors, for the PIDA+ paved roads (Figure O.8, Panel B). In these cases, in a considerable number
of climate change scenarios adaptation would result in negative savings. In particular, in scenarios
where climate change turns out to be relatively mild, the higher cost of construction would not be
offset by reductions in maintenance, repair and rehabilitation costs.
In these cases, a closer look at the second type of adaptation benefits, namely the reduction in
the down-time of the network, is warranted.

Note: The chart provides an indication of the cost savings implied by proactive adaptation action for PIDA paved roads
(Panel A) and PIDA+ paved roads (Panel B). Positive savings imply that the asset lifetime costs with adaptation is less
than the costs incurred without adaptation; negative savings imply the opposite. Box indicates the range of savings
from the 5th to the 95th percentile over climate change scenarios; line in box represents the mean value.

The Time-Saving Benefits of Adaptation
Adaptation invariably reduces traffic disruptions and the losses of productive time that these
disruptions entail; i.e., it generates time saving benefits. How large should these benefits be in
order to make adaptation worthwhile, irrespective of the climate scenario considered?
To address this question, this book uses a break-even analysis, illustrated in the charts (O.9 and
O.10). This scenario-based analysis examines the “breakeven” point, where the value of disruption
is large enough to justify the adoption of a proactive adaptation approach, and provides additional
insights for adaptation planning. Low breakeven values should encourage proactive action, while
higher breakeven values suggest proactive action is not warranted.
For any given road asset and climate stressor, there will not be a single breakeven value, but a
distribution of values across climate scenarios. In scenarios of harsher future climate (e.g., more
flooding, more frequent or intense precipitation), breakeven values will be lower, and the case for
taking adaptation measures stronger, as the avoided disruption time will be higher. In scenarios
of milder climate change, the value of avoided disruption time will need to be higher to justify
adaptation, as there will be fewer disruption days avoided.
Because prior work provides some basic information on traffic volumes by country, for paved and
unpaved roads, breakeven values in Figure O.9 below are expressed as the daily value, per vehicle,
of time wasted due to the disruption of road. Put another way, this value is a threshold for action.
If decision makers think that the value of time wasted every day (on average) as a result of climate


                                                          14
change, per vehicle, is at least as large or higher than the breakeven value calculated here, then
proactive action make sense. The larger the number of climate scenarios where the threshold for
action is exceeded, the stronger the case for adaptation. A good benchmark value for comparison
is the valuation of a day of traffic delays is one-half the daily wage rate. The average daily wage for
most workers varies considerably across Sub-Saharan Africa, from roughly $30 per day in countries
such as South Africa and Botswana, to as little as $3.50 per day in countries such as Ethiopia and
Uganda, according to UN International Labor Organization data. For the purposes of this work,
using $10 per day as a rough benchmark value of an avoided day of disruption, per vehicle, helps
us to interpret the results (using the conservative assumption of one traveler per vehicle).
In Figure O.9 below, which presents breakeven values by country for the temperature stressor, it
is clear that in all countries except for the few on the far left of the graphic, the breakeven values
are less than $10 per day, per vehicle, for the 95th percentile climate scenario. That is, there are
only 5% of the scenarios considered where climate change is so mild that the time savings
generated do not justify adaptation.
The conclusion that follows for the other 95% of the climate scenarios considered is that, once
disruption is considered, adaptation to the temperature stressor for all paved roads in these
countries is justified. This reinforces, at the level of individual countries, the insight about the merit
of proactive adaptation in response to temperature increases, already reported for the region as
a whole (Figure O.8 above), but in this case extended to both new PIDA roads, and existing paved
roads in the PIDA+ domain. In general, some of the more advantageous areas for proactive
adaptation for paved roads are for countries in the warm temperate climates of Sub-Saharan
Africa. These include Zambia, parts of Angola and Zimbabwe, the southern coast of Mozambique
and north-eastern coast of South Africa, as well parts of Madagascar.
By looking at the higher end of the distribution of the breakeven values (e.g., the 95th percentile),
road planners can have a simple tool to assess the merits of adaptation, despite climate
uncertainty. That is, to compare the 95 th percentile of the distribution of breakeven values, to a
plausible estimate (discussed above) of the value of the avoided time lost.
The intuition is that the 95th percentile represent a high regret cost of adapting (since it refers to
scenarios where climate change does not turn out to be as bad as feared). If even in that case, the
value of the avoided disruption time is considered higher than the breakeven value, the case for
adaptation will be even stronger for the scenarios of more pronounced climate change (the rest
of the distribution of climate outcomes below the 95h percentile).

Note: The chart provides an indication of the per-vehicle value of time required to justify proactive adaptation action
(break-even value), considering both disruption time and financial cost implications. Higher break-even values imply
action may not be justified – lower breakeven values imply action is justified. Blue dot is the 5th percentile (lowest
break-even value) over climate change projections; orange dot is the 95th percentile (highest break-even value). Green
line at $10 breakeven provides a reference point that corresponds to a per vehicle per disruption day value that is
roughly consistent with daily wages in several African countries.

Results for the precipitation and flooding stressors for paved roads (not shown in the present
overview) indicate higher break-even values, compared to the temperature stressor, so only a few
countries have a breakeven value below $10 per person-day (see main report for more details). In
general, proactive adaptation for paved roads in response to the flooding and precipitation
stressors are evident in the equatorial steppe area, which occurs in Kenya and northern Gabon,
and relatively large benefits are found in response to the precipitation stressor in some of the
desert climatic zones, in large areas of the region across multiple countries.
Also, when disruption time is considered, a case can be made for adapting unpaved roads in
several countries. Figure O.10 presents traffic-adjusted breakeven values for the flooding and
precipitation stressors related to unpaved roads. While many countries have very high, worst case
break-even values (i.e., high adaptation regrets when climate change turns out to be mild) for both
stressors there are still a handful of countries where a worst-case breakeven value below $10 per
person-day is seen for precipitation on the right of Figure O.10 (Panel A); and for flooding (Panel

B). In these countries, adaptation can generate large reduction in disruption time; and there are
relatively high unpaved road traffic volumes (compared to other countries in the scope of the
study). The combination of these two effects points to the importance of seriously considering
adaptation, even for unpaved roads.

Note: The chart provides an indication of the per-vehicle value of time required to justify proactive adaptation action
(break-even value), considering both disruption time and financial cost implications. Both charts refer to unpaved
roads in PIDA+ network. Panel A addresses adaptation action in response to changes in precipitation; Panel B
addresses adaptation action in response to changes in flooding. Higher break-even values imply action may not be
justified – lower breakeven values imply action is justified. Blue dot shows the result for the 5th percentile (lowest
break-even value) over climate change scenarios; orange dot shows the result for the 95th percentile (highest break-
even value). Green line at $10 breakeven provides a reference point that corresponds to a per vehicle per disruption
day value that is roughly consistent with daily wages in several African countries.

Road planners are likely to have more granular information, compared to what was possible to
obtain for this study, on expected traffic volumes, redundancy at the road network level, and unit
value of travel time applicable to their countries. Using such data, the approach proposed in this
report enables planners to make more informed decisions on whether a proactive adaptation
response is justified in any particular project, in anticipation of climate change.

How Much Will It Cost to Proactively Adapt the PIDA Investments?
The savings in lifetime asset cost and the avoided disruption time represent deferred benefits, but
the costs of adaptation must be financed upfront. Analysis of the incremental investment required
to enhance the climate resilience of the PIDA roads investments suggests that only a relatively
small additional investment is needed to achieve this goal (Figure O.11). This finding applies only
to a portion of the total PIDA+ network – that is, only the PIDA component, which is 100 percent
newly constructed paved roads. These relatively small incremental costs would not necessarily
apply to unpaved roads or most existing paved roads.


                                                          18
Most of the PIDA investments analyzed here will occur by 2030 (many have projected construction
completion dates in 2030), and the total construction cost without adaptation is estimated at
$12.8 billion. Excluding climate outliers (the top and bottom 5%), construction costs with
adaptation ranges between $13.3 and $15.7 billion (a 3% to 23% increase). The baseline costs in
the later period are lower, $3.5 billion, but the range of incremental cost for adaptation is roughly
proportional to the adaptation cost incurred in the prior period.

Note: Chart provides a summary of the overall construction costs of proactive action for PIDA roads across all future
climates, as compared to baseline (no adaptation) costs estimated in PIDA documents. Box indicates costs of 25th to
the 75th percentiles over climate change scenarios; line in box represents the mean value; and whiskers extending
from box indicate the range from the 5th to the 95th percentiles Number next to box is mean value. Left bar is for PIDA
PAP projects scheduled to begin construction in the 2015 to 2030 period; right bar is for projects scheduled to begin

Results that are disaggregated by stressor (see Chapter 6 of the main report) show that the
incremental cost to achieve resilience to the temperature stressor is much lower, between 1% and
3% of the baseline cost, for the five largest cost PIDA corridors (that is, PIDA projects) considered
in the study, but costs to achieve resilience to the precipitation and flooding stressors tend to be
higher. These results suggest that a targeted approach to resilience, both over stressors and across
PIDA corridors, is appropriate.

An Agenda for Action for Climate Resilience of Africa's Roads and Bridges
This book provides a framework for assessing climate related risks to road investments in Africa.
A key finding is that, in the period from the present to 2050, climate change could cause:

   •     Direct damages: tens of billions of dollars in damages to roads, which will require additional
         maintenance to preserve basic serviceability; preliminary estimation of damage to bridges
         suggests costs may be even higher (in the order of $30 billion, mean estimate).
   •     Substantial system disruption: apart from increasing maintenance costs, climate changes
         will cause the disruption of road links, interrupting the flow of goods and people, to the
         tune of 100 million days of disrupted road links by 2050, all of which has a substantial
         economic cost.
A second important finding of this study is the fact that engineering solutions can be effective in
addressing some impacts of climate change, through proactive action, depending on the context.
These solutions can provide long-term resilience, with less disruption and lower lifetime
maintenance costs, in exchange for a higher up-front investment. In particular, this study finds
that that investing proactively in pavement improvements to resist increased temperature is
economically justified under most climate projections even without taking into account disruption
costs.
On the other hand, the study finds that in many situations proactive adaptation to precipitation
and flooding events is unlikely to be justified solely on the grounds of reducing the lifetime
expenditure on road assets (the sum total of construction, maintenance and rehabilitation costs).
Adaptation however, could be justified when the direct and indirect benefits of avoided
disruptions are factored into the analysis. The merits of investing in adaptation, however, will have
to be assessed on a case by case basis, considering the likely volume of the traffic disrupted in the
absence of adaptation; and the opportunity cost of the time that would be lost because of
disruption. The type of case-by-case analysis does not need to be complex – as outlined in Box O.3
below, the steps can be relatively simple.
Nonetheless, it is important to avoid blanket prescriptions for infrastructure adaptations, opting
instead for specific interventions in resilient design according to the circumstances of each project
and individual economic analyses, and explicitly acknowledges the need to balance the need for
adaptation and resilience with the tendency to over-design.

 Box O.3. What Does It Take to Integrate Climate Change into Road Project Design?
 Implementing the approach proposed in this study is relatively straightforward. The modeling
 components required for a project- or country-level climate change adaptation analysis for roads
 consist of the following:

     •    A set of downscaled climate projections for the project’s or country’s relevant geographic
          region.

                                                  20
     •   Information on the baseline capital and maintenance costs for constructing roads to alternative
         design specifications.
     •   A simple project design and cost model that can reproduce existing cost estimates from pre-
         feasibility studies, and can estimate how costs would vary with alternative design specifications
         that incorporate adaptation. If the complexity of the design precludes the development of a
         simple design and cost model, several estimates of alternative designs could be developed
         using more detailed tools.
 The requisite sets of climate projections have become increasingly available, including those used for
 this report. These data sets will soon be made available Africa-wide through a central data repository
 (http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/). Appropriate road analysis tools have also become
 increasingly available and can be calibrated using the same data utilized in feasibility studies. Finally,
 this study has developed a relatively transparent set of adaptation measures for each climate stressor,
 that can be used as a template for a wide range of applications.


Assessing adaptation options when the financial and disruption implications are nuanced (for
example, for unpaved roads, and for responses to changes in precipitation and flooding), will
require assistance to local and national transportation planners. The need for this assistance is one
reason the World Bank is pursuing support for an Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility (Afri-
Res) as described in Box O.4 below.

 Box O.4. Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility (AFRI-RES)
 To develop Africa's capacity to systematically integrate climate change considerations into the planning
 and design of long-lived investments, the World Bank, the Africa Union Commission and the United
 Nation Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) have teamed up to develop the Africa Climate Resilient
 Investment Facility (Afri-Res). The facility will develop guidelines, provide training, deliver on-demand
 advisory services, make data and knowledge tools more easily accessible, and ultimately help attract
 funding from sources of development and climate finance.

 The facility is one of the components of the World Bank Group’s $16 billion Africa Climate Business Plan
 that was presented at COP21 in Paris in November 2105:

 (http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/11/25481350/accelerating-climate-resilient-low-
 carbon-development-africa-climate-business-plan).
 Seed funding in the amount of 4 Million Euros has been pledged by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF),
 and discussions are underway with other development partners to mobilize additional resources.



These findings provide a basis for making following recommendations for the consideration of
regional or sub-regional organizations (e.g., Africa Union Commission, Regional Economic
Communities), road sector ministries and agencies at the country level, along with ministries of
finances and planning; and international development partners, as described in the table below:

Improving Africa’s Road Infrastructure to Sustainably
Enhance Development
Raffaello Cervigni, Andrew Losos, and James E. Neumann


1.1    Understanding the Role of Road Infrastructure in Africa’s Development
Economic growth is highly dependent on the quality, quantity, and accessibility of a country’s
infrastructure services. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), inadequate road infrastructure is increasingly
seen as an obstacle to achieving poverty reduction and economic development goals. Lack of
connectivity in rural areas, in particular, hampers progress toward improving SSA’s agriculture
sector and rural economy, both of which are key to reducing poverty and promoting economic
growth. In addition, transport costs in Africa are among the highest in the world, which increases
the cost of trade and makes products uncompetitive on international markets (Teravaninthorn
and Raballand, 2009). Recent studies have shown that expanding the road system and increasing
the share of paved roads would yield high returns by lowering transport costs and expanding
markets (World Bank, 2010a).
The Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD) was an unprecedented knowledge program
prompted by the recognition that SSA’s weak infrastructure base is a crucial impediment to
realizing the region’s full economic potential. AICD’s flagship report (World Bank, 2010b) contains
detailed technical and economic data on network service infrastructures (including road transport)
in 24 African countries, accounting for 85 percent of the SSA population. According to the report,
although African governments have made progress in addressing the low density and poor
condition of their road networks, there is still a great deal of work to be done. For example, only
one-third of rural inhabitants live within two kilometers of an all-season road – the lowest
accessibility in the developing world (World Bank, 2010b).
The AICD report also supports a widely accepted reality of the African road network – that
maintenance is already underfunded. For example, modeling of optimal maintenance costs
indicates that about 25% of countries are not spending enough on road maintenance to cover
routine maintenance activity. Most countries spend around 2% of GDP on roads, and in general
spend much more on capital investments than maintenance; lack of maintenance deteriorates
overall quality of road networks and increases the amount that must be spent on rehabilitation,
which usually cannot be adequately covered. Some countries are better prepared than others to
bear the costs of maintaining their road networks. For example, establishment of road funds and
fuel levies is correlated with a more even split (roughly 50/50) between capital and maintenance
spending, while other countries spend 2/3 on capital, leaving maintenance seriously underfunded

                                                 25
(World Bank, 2010b). The main implication of this in responding to the new challenge of climate
change is that few African countries are in a position to face the effects of climate change on roads,
when higher temperatures, more variable precipitation, and more frequent flooding will increase
the need for road maintenance. Clearly, the need for climate resilience planning starts with fully
funding road maintenance needs before climatic events exacerbate the current situation.
Box 1.1 provides a summary of the AICD report’s key findings related to financing gaps. Notably,
an estimated $93 billion per year for the next decade will need to be invested if Africa is to fill the
infrastructure gap. 2

    Box 1.1. AICD Key Findings
    The AICD flagship report (World Bank, 2010b) describes the state of Africa’s physical infrastructure and
    estimates the costs associated with its improvement. The study provides a baseline against which future
    improvements in infrastructure services can be measured, as well as a solid empirical foundation for
    prioritizing investments and designing policy reforms in the infrastructure sectors in Africa. AICD
    establishes both an overall economic rationale for this study, and the need to provide new insights on
    how best to design Africa’s path to closing the infrastructure gap in the uncertain climate of the future.
    The report provides 10 key findings concerning the priorities of infrastructure investment in SSA. The
    findings most relevant for the roads sector are summarized below:

       Finding 1: Infrastructure Contributed over Half of Africa’s Improved Growth Performance – the key
        implication being that infrastructure is critically important to Africa’s development, now and in the
        future.
       Finding 2: Africa’s Infrastructure Lags Well behind that of Other Developing Countries –
        re-establishing the importance of aggressive infrastructure investment plans to help close the gap,
        particularly for paved roads, telephone main lines, and power generation.
       Finding 3: Africa’s Difficult Economic Geography Presents a Challenge for Infrastructure
        Development – Africa has low intraregional connectivity, and the intraregional road network is
        characterized by major discontinuities. Improving access is made difficult by the low overall
        population density, among other factors.
       Finding 4: Africa’s Infrastructure Services are Twice as Expensive as Elsewhere – Road freight tariffs
        in Africa are high, but this has more to do with exceptionally high profit margins than high costs (the
        costs for trucking operators are not much higher than elsewhere).
       Finding 6: Africa’s Infrastructure Spending Needs at $93 Billion a Year Are More than Double Previous
        Estimates by the Commission for Africa – providing a fresh look at infrastructure needs clarifies the
        magnitude and urgency of infrastructure investments.
       Finding 7: The Infrastructure Challenge Varies Greatly by Country Type – acknowledging the need to
        take a geographically oriented “bottom-up” approach; coincidentally, it is also necessary to evaluate
        climate risks and adaptation opportunities that also manifest differentially across space.


2
    The gap is defined as the distance between the current quantity and quality of infrastructure, and a set of sector-
    specific targets that, if achieved, would enable Africa to catch up with the rest of the developing world. These
    include, for example, the Millennium Development Goal targets for water; connectivity between all key economic
    nodes; supply-demand balance for power, etc.

                                                           26
     Finding 10: Africa’s Institutional, Regulatory, and Administrative Reform Process Is Only Halfway
      Along – countries have made progress, but much work remains to be done, particularly in the
      transport sector.



1.2     The Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa
Africa has experienced significant economic growth over the past decade of 5% per year, but in
order to sustain this growth, investment in infrastructure is necessary. The Program for
Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) is a major effort, undertaken under the auspices of
the Africa Union Commission, to improve and expand key infrastructure across the continent.
Endorsed in 2012 by the continent’s national leaders, PIDA lays out an ambitious long-term plan
for closing Africa’s infrastructure gap and enabling per-capita income to rise above US$10,000 in
all countries of the continent by 2040. To enable such a substantial increase in the standard of
living to happen, a rapid and major upgrade of the region’s stock of infrastructure is required. The
total estimated cost of implementing all of the projects identified in PIDA by 2040 is US$360 billion.
The PIDA Priority Action Plan (PAP) is a subset of 51 priority infrastructure programs in the energy,
water, transport, and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors that are designed
to address sector-specific priority infrastructure deficits. The PAP requires an investment of an
estimated US$68 billion to be realized by 2020. Energy needs account for the largest portion of
the needed investment (60%), followed by transport (37%).
For this report, we rely on the results of the PIDA process to characterize the extent of major trans-
boundary road infrastructure development anticipated through mid-century. The transport
component of PIDA focuses on connectivity improvements, corridor modernization, port and
railway modernization, and air transport modernization. The benefits of such improvements in
SSA’s road infrastructure alone, however, could be substantial. Fostering better transport
between inland areas and the coast could boost exports, while improving connectivity within
Africa could substantially improve intra-African trade. In addition, PIDA stresses trans-boundary
regional integration, with specific reference to building a road network that will facilitate the
opening of trade corridors, and provide efficiency gains and advances in regional integration that
will create a shift from overseas trade to trade between countries and within and across regions.

In addition to the PIDA projects, there are a number of country-level road projects that are
included in master plans and regional plans. Collectively valued at approximately US$45 billion
through 2030, the country-level infrastructure investment is significant. These high-priority
projects are considered in this study along with the PIDA PAP projects; the full suite of projects
examined in this study is referred to as the “PIDA+” investment scenario.

1.3     Vulnerability of Roads to Climate Change
Much of the investment in SSA’s infrastructure will support the construction of long-lived
infrastructure (e.g., dams, roads, power stations, etc.) that needs to be capable of delivering
services under both current and future climates. Temperatures are projected to rise across the
continent and very high temperatures can result in the softening and rutting of asphalt roads.
Some parts of Africa will see an increase in precipitation, which can lead to reduced load-carrying
capacity and lifespan of roads. Many parts of Africa will face more intense precipitation, which can
increase flooding frequencies. These floods can overrun and erode roads, particularly unpaved
roads (e.g., Niang et al., 2014).
Some recent literature also provides insights about the potential economy-wide implications of
severe climate events that affect the road network, particularly implications for food security.
For example, in Burkina Faso, maize price volatility is found to be greatest in remote (poorly
connected) markets (Ndiaye, Maitre d’Hôtel, and Le Cotty, 2015). As climate change further
reduces connectivity, this raises the potential for food shortages and economic shocks to
vulnerable areas. In addition, after Tropical Storm Agatha struck Guatemala in 2010, per capita
consumption fell 13 percent, raising poverty by 18 percent; in particular, food expenditures fell 10
percent, accounting for 40 percent of the total consumption drop (Baez et al., 2014). This
stemmed from a major loss in food infrastructure and transport, resulting in a 17 percent increase
in food prices 10 months after the storm. In this instance, the storm caused a logistical problem
rather than a decline in domestic production, since it occurred in the middle of the first planting
season, at a benign time with respect to local agricultural cycles.
While there is widespread scientific consensus that the climate of the next few decades will be
significantly different from today’s climate, and the current trajectory of increasing temperatures
is likely to accelerate over the next several decades, there remains large uncertainty about
whether dryer or wetter conditions will prevail in SSA’s various sub-regions and countries. The
challenge, therefore, is in understanding the range of climate impacts that may occur, and making
decisions about infrastructure investments that minimize risks and maximize opportunities.

1.4     Integrating Climate Change in Road Investment Planning
The goal of this study is to promote climate-smart investment in road infrastructure by evaluating
planned investments in light of future climate change. Specifically, the study evaluates the
potential for adapting roads to reduce potential damages that result from inaction. The approach
used in this study parallels the effort documented in Cervigni et al. (2015), which examined
adaptation options for the power, irrigation, and water supply sectors.

1.4.1   Scope of the study

This study evaluates climate change impacts and adaptation options for planned road investments
in SSA through 2030, including 11 transport projects from the PIDA PAP, comprising 111 individual


                                                28
road segment investments and 261 country-level road segment projects. The full suite of
infrastructure investments analyzed in the study is referred to as the “PIDA+” network and is
detailed in Appendix A.

1.4.2   Value added from the study

This is the first study to comprehensively examine climate change impacts and adaptation for the
roads sector of SSA. Subject to the methodological limitations discussed in chapter 2, specific
elements of novelty and value added of the study include:
    A comprehensive climate vulnerability assessment of all primary and secondary roads in
     SSA, including impacts from higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, and increases
     in flooding.
    An analysis of the costs and benefits of adaptation of PIDA+ roads. The adaptations include
     changing materials to better withstand heat, improving drainage or thickening roads to
     offset increased precipitation, and increasing culvert size to reduce flood risks. The benefits
     include reduction in maintenance costs (which would otherwise increase with climate
     change), and reduction in road disruption times.
    A clear set of recommendations for project financiers, country-level Ministries of Transport
     and Finance, and firms engaged in road design, construction, and maintenance, to address
     the effects of climate change on Africa’s road and bridge network, acknowledging the deep
     uncertainty on how climate change will manifest itself in Sub-Saharan Africa.

1.4.3   Book structure

The remainder of the book is organized as follows:
    Chapter 2 describes the methods used in the study;
    Chapter 3 describes the reference investment scenario (i.e., the PIDA+ network);
    Chapter 4 presents the climate change projections that are used in the study to estimate
     the vulnerability of the PIDA+ network and assess the costs and benefits of adaptation;
    Chapter 5 presents the results of the reactive response analysis for roads and bridges,
     which assumes no proactive steps are taken to anticipate the impacts of climate change.
    Chapter 6 describes the results of the analysis of proactive adaptation and the financial
     costs compared to reactive response strategies for roads and bridges, as well as analysis of
     the effect of proactive adaptation on disruption times for roads. The scenario-based
     analysis provides conclusions about whether it is better to prepare for climate change
     (proactive adaptation) or address climate change impacts as they happen (reactive
     response).
    Chapter 7 provides policy recommendations with a particular focus on key actionable
     insights from the study, and specific recommendations for project financiers, national
     governments, and firms engaged in road design, construction, and maintenance.

Methodology
Kenneth M. Strzepek, James E. Neumann, Paul Chinowsky, and Raffaello Cervigni


2.1      Framework
This study assesses the vulnerability to climate change of planned road investments in SSA in light
of future climate change, and evaluates adaptation options that could be taken to minimize
damages. The approach includes the development of three distinct scenarios for roads investment
in SSA (Table 2.1):
      1. Reference scenario: the reference scenario represents the planned roads investment in
         SSA through 2030. It includes projects from the PIDA PAP as well as country-level road
         projects; these two sets of projects are referred to as the “PIDA+” investment scenario
         (described in detail in Chapter 3). No climate impacts or adaptations are modeled in this
         scenario.
      2. Climate change, reactive response: in this scenario, the full range of climate futures is
         estimated, and their impacts quantified as the costs of reactively responding to climate
         stressors after they have occurred, mainly through increased maintenance activity. This
         scenario illustrates the vulnerability of the PIDA+ network to future climate impacts.
      3. Climate change, proactive adaptation: in this scenario, anticipatory measures are taken to
         mitigate the effects of climate change and take advantage of any opportunities. Climate
         change impacts are quantified in terms of up-front costs of design changes, reductions in
         subsequent needs for repeated repairs and maintenance, and reductions in road
         disruption.
Comparison of the road assets’ lifetime costs (i.e., construction, maintenance, rehabilitation,
repairs) under the reactive and proactive scenarios provides an assessment of the financial case
for adaptation. In some cases, the financial case (i.e. net lifetime savings under adaptation) is
sufficient to justify investments in proactive adaptation measures. However, although the financial
perspective is informative, it does not account for the potential for climate change to result in
disruptions in the use of the road network. As a result, the study separately evaluates the impacts
of climate change on disruption time and evaluates the benefits of adaptation in reducing these
effects. Importantly, although the tools used in the analysis allow disruption to be quantified, it is
not currently possible to reliably monetize disruption. The study therefore considers both the
financial benefits and the disruption benefits of adaptation in a decision-making context, called a
“break-even analysis,” which identifies climatic conditions and road types for which the benefit of



                                                 31
reduced disruption time are likely to justify adaptation when the financial analysis alone of lifetime
asset costs cannot.

The analysis assumes throughout that the timing, management and financing of periodic
maintenance is adequate and in accordance with established engineering standards. While this
may seem at odds with the reality of most of the region (where maintenance is substantially
underfunded), the assumption is justified because it allows to standardize the modeling across
countries, and to focus on the incremental maintenance cost caused by climate change. However,
this does not imply that closing the current financing gap for maintenance is not important. To the
contrary, mobilizing additional resources for maintenance will be a key, no-regret first step in
reducing countries’ vulnerability to climate change. The reason is that if countries continue to
under-fund maintenance, they will be even more exposed to climate change than the present
analysis concludes.
The study uses the Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS) – described in Box 2.1 – to model
future climate impacts and quantify the costs and benefits associated with each scenario.



                                                 32
  Box 2.1. The Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS)
  The Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS) is a software model that integrates expertise from
  researchers in civil and environmental engineering, water resources, architecture, international
  development, and economics. It is a quantitative, engineering-based analysis tool to understand the
  impacts of climate change on current and future roads, bridges, and other infrastructure.
  IPSS models existing vulnerabilities to future weather, and specific adaptation options to respond to
  changed climate. Elements of analysis include: changes in temperature (maximum temperatures and
  freeze-thaw), changes in precipitation (drainage, flooding, and degradation rates), and changes in flood
  return times. The model is spatially disaggregated, usually at the resolution of climate forecast grid cells,
  and the basic structure incorporates climate inputs, baseline infrastructure cost and management
  information, an extensive database of stressor-response functions, and flexible post-processing and
  results aggregation options.
  Costs are assessed based on two approaches. First, a reactive “no adaptation” approach which analyzes
  a changing future climate on existing road design standards. This is compared to a proactive
  “adaptation” approach which reduces future risk and damages by changing design standards at
  upgrades or re-construction. Both maintenance and new construction/re-construction costs are
  provided. The model incorporates flexibility and customized analysis for application to multiple
  contexts, including baseline cost information, degradation rates, historic flood data, and specific
  adaptation budgets. Stressor-response relationships are based on based on a number of sources
  including engineering research, materials studies, and published US Dept. of Transportation and Federal
  Highway Administration.



2.2      Development of the PIDA+ Road Inventory
The road inventory used in this study (referred to as the “PIDA+” network) includes both existing
and new roads. The new roads include PIDA PAP projects and country-level road projects. The
inventory was compiled from four main sources:
      1. Country-sourced datasets (e.g., data from stakeholders, government websites, and
         transport master plans);
      2. AICD road inventory datasets;
      3. Published road inventory datasets (e.g., International Road Federation, 2012); and
      4. The DeLorme 2012 Digital Atlas of the Earth (hereafter, DAE 2012).
In compiling the PIDA+ network, the team endeavored to use country-sourced data wherever
possible, because it is considered to be the most reliable. Country-sourced data were used for a
total of 22 out of the 49 countries included in the study (approximately 45%). The gaps in these
data were filled using a combination of the remaining three sources. The AICD dataset provided
the lengths of primary roads and road functional classes and surface types. The DAE 2012 dataset
provided total road lengths by country, and these data were cross-checked against the
International Road Federation data. In some cases, road segments could not be included in the

                                                      33
network due to insufficient information. Chapter 3 provides a detailed discussion of each source,
including strengths and limitations.
After the PIDA+ network was compiled in GIS, the data were overlaid with a half-degree grid cell
network (the geographic scale at which we project climate change – approximately 50km by 50
km per cell) for further processing. The final dataset includes approximately 2.8 million km of
roads, compared to the 371,000 km included in the AICD dataset. Appendix A presents a table
with the complete PIDA+ inventory organized by country, functional class (primary, secondary,
tertiary, and unknown/other), and surface type (paved, unpaved, and unknown).

2.3     Analysis of Reactive Response (Vulnerability Analysis)
This analysis examines the impacts of climate change assuming that no proactive, anticipatory
measures are taken to protect the PIDA+ network against the impacts of climate change. Impacts
are quantified as the increased maintenance costs for the roadways that are incurred as a result
of climate stressors, including changes in precipitation, temperature, and flooding (see Chapter 4
for more details on the climate change projections used in the study). The study models adaptation
responses based on stressor-response rules. Table 2.2 presents the adaptation measures
associated with each climate stressor, including a set of reactive measures that do not require
major capital or rehabilitation expense, and proactive measures that involve an upfront capital
cost with the benefit of much reduced maintenance expense. The costs associated with these
adaptations are based on figures provided by roadway design and management practitioners and
reflect local construction and maintenance costs. Costs of adaptations on a per kilometer basis are
compiled for each grid cell for each climate scenario.

As shown in Table 2.2, paved and unpaved roads have distinct proactive adaptation approaches
that reflect differences in construction and vulnerabilities. For paved roads, adaptations to
temperature focus on changing the design mix as well as the design of the seals to protect the
road from further damage. For precipitation, adaptations include both increasing the road
thickness and expanding the width of the road to allow for improved drainage of surface water
away from the road. Flooding adaptations focus on culvert design changes.
Temperature does not affect unpaved roads, so adaptation to this stressor is not needed.
However, higher precipitation requires increases in base layer thickness of unpaved roads to
enable greater carrying capacity and drainage. In addition, there is an option to upgrade to a paved
road where appropriate. The design of culverts is changed to adapt to increased flooding.

2.4    Analysis of Proactive Adaptation
Under the second scenario, IPSS estimates the changes in costs assuming adaptations are made in
response to each climate change scenario. For example, if a gravel road is projected to be washed


                                                    35
out under a climate change scenario, the road bed may be thickened or paved road as the road is
being built in anticipation of the climate events. The specific proactive actions assessed are
described in Table 2.2.
The costs are calculated in present value 2015 US$ with a 6% discount rate, with a sensitivity
analysis using a 3% discount rate. Costs are calculated on a total and per-kilometer basis and
compiled for ½ degree by ½ degree grid cells (about 50 km x 50 km), consistent with the resolution
of the climate projections (see Chapter 4).
Adaptation of the road and bridge system to climate change should ideally reflect the age and
construction vintage of the roads and bridges analyzed, with specific estimates of when
rehabilitation and replacement cycles occur. For the PIDA component of the road inventory, the
expected build date provides information to trigger the start of a maintenance cycle, followed by
a rehabilitation action when the useful life of the road is effectively exhausted. The rehabilitation
action is less costly than a full new corridor build, but more costly than periodic maintenance. For
existing roads, the road vintage is unknown, so IPSS assigns a vintage assuming a uniform vintage
distribution across the road type lifespan (e.g., 20 years) within each ½ degree by ½ degree climate
grid cell, and a similar maintenance and rehabilitation cycled is triggered. 3 The approach therefore
follows a conventional rehabilitation cycle, albeit optimized compared to likely current
maintenance practice in Africa.
In the case where a road is completed after 2030, the impact of climate change on the road is
modeled and accounted for only through the study limit of 2050. Thus, for roads constructed in
2045, climate impacts are considered only through 2050. In the proactive adaptation scenario, the
full costs of adaptation are accounted for, but the benefits (i.e., reduced maintenance costs) are
only included through 2050. As a result, the analysis may estimate relatively higher costs
associated with a proactive approach for that subset of roads.

2.5        Disruption Analysis
The disruption analysis evaluates the time that each road in the PIDA+ network is estimated to be
“out of service” as a result of climate change. It relies on historical estimates of the time required
to conduct road maintenance and rehabilitation, derived from the World Bank ROCKS Worldwide
Database. The ROCKS database was selected due to its broad representation of relevant road
maintenance and construction project data, collected by the World Bank for 65 developing
countries.
The analysis estimates disruption time for the PIDA+ network in terms of the number of days per
kilometer of disruption that will occur for each maintenance task. The duration of each disruption
event is determined based on both the amount of time required for the maintenance and
rehabilitation activities (derived from the ROCKS database) and the severity of the event. For

3
    The assignment of a uniform distribution of capital stock vintage to existing roads is a compromise that reflects data
    limitations.

                                                            36
example, a 100-year flooding event would result in a longer period of disruption compared to a
10-year flooding event because it would likely result in a greater extent of damage.
Table 2.3 presents disruption estimates for specific events. If the events in the reactive and
proactive components of the table were to occur with the same frequency, then it would be
reasonable to assume that proactive action leads to more disruption, because the values in the
right column for disruption days are generally higher for proactive compared to reactive activities.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that proactive activities are designed for application only
at the beginning of a rehabilitation cycle, and greatly reduce if not eliminate the need for reactive
responses during the cycle. As a result, when this information is combined in the IPSS model with
the number of reactive actions that climate change, it is generally (though not always) true that
proactive action reduces disruption days.

The disruption rates for specific events are then multiplied by the corresponding number of
kilometers of road inventory within the PIDA+ network to obtain a total disruption number. Under
the proactive adaptation scenario, however, certain roads avoid the disruption impact because
they were proactively maintained or rehabilitated. This scenario is described in greater detail in
Chapter 6.

2.6    Breakeven Analysis
For roads, a breakeven analysis is conducted to determine whether the combined benefits of
reduced maintenance costs, denominated in dollars, and reduced disruption time, denominated
in days, may be sufficient to justify proactive action. Note that the level of disruption days differs
for each climate scenario, just as the reactive and proactive costs differ by scenario. As a result,
each climate scenario generates a different breakeven value, so a distribution of breakeven values
can be provided for each road type and climate stressor, by country and climate zone.
Valuation of disruption days is highly uncertain, and likely to be very context specific, reflecting
the level of traffic on the road (a scalar which could convert days of disruption due to disruption
to person-days of disruption), the redundancy of the network (a scalar which would reflect
opportunities to avoid disruption by re-routing), and individual value of lost time in a transport
context. Literature exists on the value of time in Africa, and generic rules of thumb are often used,
such as application of 50% of the daily wage to avoid lost wait time, but comprehensive wage data
is missing for many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Amidst these substantial uncertainties and data
limitations, it is nonetheless possible to estimate the value of disruption that, if applied to lost
disruption days, and when combined with the net cost of proactive measures, is sufficient to justify
proactive action.
For each climate scenario, including the historical scenario, the breakeven analysis starts by
calculating the savings in road assets lifetime costs (in net present value terms) when adapting to
climate change, compared to the reactive response of not adapting. Where the savings are
positive, proactive response is already justified. Where the savings are negative, the analysis
proceeds to identify the reduction in disruption days that occurs under the proactive adaptation
scenario, relative to the reactive response scenario. The breakeven value is then calculated as the
net financial cost of proactive action divided by the reduced disruption days. If the unit value of
the time saved as a result of adaptation is equal to, or higher than, the breakeven value, then
adaptation will be justified.
The analysis is conducted independently for each climate scenario and stressor, at various scales
of spatial aggregation and road categories (PIDA and PIDA+), and is then presented as a
distribution of breakeven values over the range of climate change scenarios. This makes it possible
to make decisions in spite of uncertainty on future climate change. In particular, the maximum
breakeven value corresponds to the scenario of mildest climate change, under which adaptation
may be difficult to justify. If even in that case, the opportunity cost of time saved thanks to
adaptation is deemed higher than the break-even value, proactive adaptation is justified, and the
case for undertaking it will be even stronger in other climate scenarios. Some decision makers,
however, may be comfortable knowing that in 95% or 75% of the climate scenarios, proactive
action is justified.

2.7    Bridges Analysis
Recent analysis in Mozambique suggests that some of the worst effects of flooding are on the
bridge component of road transport networks, rather than road surfaces and culverts. Analyzing
the effect of climate change on bridges in SSA is complicated, however, by the fact that there is
no inventory of bridges for this region. As a result, the study developed a synthetic inventory by
intersecting the road network with water crossings in GIS. The method was calibrated using the
same technique for a U.S. land area where a comprehensive bridge inventory exists, and yielded
approximately 90% to 95% accuracy with some variation across regions. Google Earth inspection
of a subset of the identified bridges indicates that the method slightly over-identifies bridges.
The inventory was coupled with the climate-related flood risk results generated for the road
analyses, to generate a first estimate of the vulnerability of bridges to climate stress. The estimates
of vulnerability are based on comparison of current to future return periods for flooding at the
bridge location. Vulnerability in physical terms is measured by a bridge count using the 100-year,
75-year, and 50-year flood exposure as signature events. The estimate addresses all of SSA, with
an indicator of whether the bridge supports a primary, secondary, or tertiary road, and whether
the bridge supports a current or planned road corridor. As described in Wright et al. (2012),
bridges are mainly vulnerable to bank erosion and scour related to flood events. In the U.S., these
effects are comparable in economic terms to those on the full road network (Neumann et al.,
2014). While it is not possible to develop a full economic impact estimate, owing to the lack of
bridge condition data, the study provides an initial “screening level” estimate for bridges.
The analysis estimates impacts by first assuming that all current bridges are resilient to the current
50-year flood. Flood flow analyses provide an estimate of the current 50-year flood by grid cell.
Then, using the climate scenarios and a simple water routing model, the study forecasts how often
and by how much this threshold will be exceeded. Minor damage is assumed based on a change
from 50-year design to existing 75-year flood. This level of threat triggers a cost to add diversionary
measures to base of bridge piers. Major damage involves exposure to a flood consistent with the
existing 100-year interval. This level of flood exposure triggers action to strengthen bridge piers
and abutments with additional concrete. The costs of these events, coupled with the estimated
future exposure of bridges to flood risk, provides the basis for the reactive cost estimates for
bridges.
Other adaptations might be considered for project scale analyses. For example, in addition to the
bridge support vulnerability assessed here, failure of a bridge as a result of climate change can
occur from wash-outs of soils at abutments or piers. Also, decks and piers themselves can fail if
lack of maintenance has resulted in a build-up of debris, reducing the waterway area, and/or
substantially increasing the lateral forces on the structure. Lack of regular maintenance is a key
issue in these failures. There is generally some factor of safety built into design of this type of
infrastructure, so small increases in run-off may not be of concern, as much as a lack of
maintenance. This analysis, the first of its kind at the continental scale, necessarily focuses on the


                                                  39
potential for larger changes in runoff to substantially impact the African bridge network, but at a
project scale, these other vulnerabilities could also be assessed using local hydrological data.

2.8      Limitations
In general, the purpose of this analysis was to gain an understanding of the potential magnitude
of climate change impacts on Africa’s road networks and, in particular, on planned investments in
road improvements and network expansion. The adaptation analysis provides insight as to
whether proactive adaptations (those done in anticipation of potential future changes in climate)
would have benefits over the timeframe considered, through 2050, both in terms of cost savings
and reduced disruption time.
The main limitation of this study is that it uses, by necessity, a “top-down” approach. For example,
rather than using location-specific information for road maintenance and repair costs and
practices, the study applies uniform unit costs for all of SSA. In addition, the analysis is not able to
comprehensively consider specific road conditions such as topography. As a result, the results
should be interpreted with caution, and should not be used for specific design purposes. Rather,
the results are intended to assist in identifying broad policy insights at a continental, regional, and
national scale, and in a few instances, subnational by climate zone. In particular, key limitations of
the analysis include:

       Partial treatment of uncertainty. The IPSS model is deterministic in nature and a choice was
        made that the first order uncertainty to be addressed in this study, as a contribution to the
        understanding of the road asset management problem in Africa, was to examine
        uncertainty in the risk of inaction and options to increase capital investments (proactive
        action) across a range of climate futures. Uncertainty in other divers of lifetime road asset
        costs is not considered
       Limited calibration of cost estimates. (IPSS) is a simulation engine which can be used to
        compare the results of alternative simulation scenarios to identify a least-cost approach
        (reactive response or proactive adaptation). The study team made an effort to calibrate
        the maintenance cost results to those of the RONET model used in the AICD report – this
        effort confirmed that the input parameters used were within 25% of those used by RONET.
        However, there remains sparse information and significant uncertainty concerning the
        actual cost required to achieve road maintenance activities in Africa. As noted in Chapter
        7, the World Bank continues to undertake new efforts to better characterize these costs
        for use in a road asset management decision support system.
       Optimal Maintenance Assumption. An important inherent limitation in examining the
        annual maintenance versus capital cost tradeoff using continental scale assumptions is the
        need to model a standardized, and optimized, maintenance schedule. Optimal
        maintenance departs from the reality in Africa of fairly systematic and widespread
        underinvestment in maintenance. However, with limited information on the current and
        future expenditure in maintenance across African countries, optimal maintenance is the


                                                  40
    only feasible modeling option at this time. The likely impact of this assumption is that we
    underestimate the impacts of climate change on roads, because less than optimal
    maintenance would be expected to reduce the useful life of roads, and more than
    proportionately increase both the disruption expected from impassible roads, and the cost
    to bring them back to a usable state.
   Disruption analyses . The disruption analysis is based on limited data on the opportunity
    cost of usable roads that are able to carry freight and passenger traffic. The true cost of
    disruption should take into account road traffic volumes, the value of the trip, and options
    for alternative routings. For this analysis, some data are available on road volumes, but
    very sparse data are available on the value of the trip or options for alternative transit
    routes. The breakeven analysis is designed to reflect these limitations, effectively asking
    policy-makers to consider whether the value of keeping roads passable exceeds the one
    calculated as the “breakeven.” A particular difficulty in the analysis is quantifying the
    differential value of disruption that is planned (such as that for routine maintenance or for
    proactive adaptation) versus unplanned disruption. Unplanned disruption requires
    unanticipated mobilization of a road repair crew, and in some cases can also wipe out road
    network redundancies (for example, an area that is flooded can disable all roads in the
    area, not only those planned for rehabilitation or repair). As outlined in Section 2.7, the
    study includes some limited sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of placing a higher
    value on unplanned disruptions.
   Flooding analysis. The flooding analysis was conducted using assumptions about how the
    frequency peak runoff and flooding might change. Due to data and resource limitations, it
    was not possible to consider topography or hydraulics in these estimates, nor was it
    possible to consider the specific geography of roads relative to river beds. As a result, the
    analysis may overestimate flooding damage in some areas where buffer zones exist in the
    area between rivers beds and roads, and underestimate flooding in areas of where
    topography or geography do not allow for flood buffer zones, thereby potentially
    amplifying floods. Also, flash floods, which occur on the temporal scale of hours, were not
    considered as the climate projections used employ a daily time scale.
   Impacts analysis. The estimation of climate change effects on roads was conducted using
    uniform cost and impact assumptions across countries and regions. Specific impacts will
    vary on a site-by-site basis. Such factors as topography, soils, use of specific materials, road
    building, and maintenance practices will likely vary considerably.
   Adaptation analysis. A limited set of adaptations were analyzed using uniform engineering
    and cost assumptions for all of SSA. Most of the adaptations characterized reflect changes
    in engineering. Other adaptations that might be assessed in future work include: land use
    planning for roads (to avoid building them in areas exposed to floods or other climate
    hazards); non-engineering solutions such as more frequent clearing of debris from
    drainage canals and culverts; and in particular, changes to maintenance funding and
    institutionalization that could serve to reduce climate change impacts to road function.

CHAPTER 3

Reference Investment Scenario
Gordon Robertson and Joel B. Smith


The reference investment scenario represents the planned roads investment in SSA through 2030.
Rather than using models to generate this scenario, the study draws on data from existing
infrastructure investment plans (e.g., PIDA), as well as other regional initiatives and country-level
master plans. The reference scenario also includes the existing road network.

3.1    PIDA PAP Road Projects
As discussed in Chapter 1, the PIDA program is an ambitious effort to improve key infrastructure
across the continent. The PIDA PAP is the agreed-upon set of priority projects and programs in the
energy, information and communications technology, transport, and water sectors. This study
includes 11 transport projects from the PIDA PAP, comprising 111 individual road segment
investments (Figure 3.1). Appendix B provides detailed information on the projects. PIDA programs
and projects that do not focus on improving connectivity through the provision, or improvement,
of road infrastructure are not included in this analysis. Examples of omitted projects include
improvements to border posts or airport facilities. In addition, projects without sufficient, readily-
available data were not included.

3.2       Sources of Information on Country-Level Road Projects
The PIDA+ inventory builds on the PIDA PAP inventory to incorporate 261 country-level road
projects planned for SSA through 2030. Appendix C provides detailed information on the country-
level projects included in the study. The inventory includes projects from country-level and
regional transport plans, identified through stakeholder outreach and an extensive review of
existing datasets.

3.2.1     Stakeholder Outreach

Much of the data on country-level and regional transport projects were obtained through the 2013
Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP) Forum in Dakar. The study team consulted
with stakeholders at the forum and requested data on road investment plans for use in the study.
Of the 18 stakeholders who participated in the forum, nine provided project data and investment
plans. To supplement these data, an extensive desktop search was undertaken to identify country-
specific transport master plans and road network statistics.
In general, country-sourced datasets represent a more complete and current status quo compared
to other sources. Therefore, every effort was made to get the best coverage from these sources.
Country-sourced data were used for a total of 22 out of the 49 countries included in the study
(approximately 45%). The country data used in this study generally include all functional road
classes, including lower-order (i.e., tertiary) roads. One limitation with these data is that they are
generally unavailable in spatial format.
A number of regionally coordinated investment plans were also consulted, including:
       Tripartite and Intergovernmental Authority on Development, or IGAD, Corridor
        Programme (TICP)
       East African Trade and Transport Facilitation Project
       AU/New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) African Action Plan: Strategic
        Overview and Revised Plan, 2010–2015
       The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Regional Infrastructure
        Development Master Plan
       African Development Bank (AfDB) Project Portfolio.

3.2.2     AICD Datasets

The PIDA+ inventory also incorporates road inventory data developed under the AICD project. The
AICD spatial roads datasets contain high-quality attribute data, which allow for the
characterization of functional class and surface type for country-road inventories. However, a
number of limitations exist, including:

      •   the datasets are focused on the primary road networks in SSA and significant gaps in
          coverage of secondary and tertiary roads exist;

                                                 44
       •    a total of nine countries also have no coverage in the AICD road datasets;
       •    the AICD project collected data for the 2001–2006 period and have not been updated
            since; and
       •    the total road network coverage in these datasets represent only approximately 371,000
            km of roads for the entire SSA.

Appendix D provides the AICD dataset sources by country.

3.2.3       DeLorme Dataset

Finally, the inventory draws on the DeLorme world dataset (DAE 2012). The DAE 2012 is a spatial
atlas that provides an unprecedented level of detail in worldwide map data, and allowed for the
identification of the following five functional road classes in SSA:
       1.   Primary (federal interstate highways)
       2.   Secondary (state or provincial highways)
       3.   Connector (major thoroughfares)
       4.   Local connector
       5.   Minor local road
The DAE 2012 is the most complete of the datasets, covering approximately 2.1 million km of roads
in SSA (a coverage that is almost six-fold larger than that of the AICD datasets). The dataset is
limited, however, because it does not contain high-quality attribute data, such as road surface
type.

3.3         PIDA+ Road Network
The inventory of PIDA+ network resulting from the consolidation of the above sources contains
approximately 2.8 million km of existing roadways across the 49 countries of SSA. Figure 3.2
presents a map that highlights the African countries included in the study, organized into four
regions used by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). 4 Of the
approximately 2.8 million km of roads, approximately 35% are located in Southern Africa, 30% in
Eastern Africa, 23% in Western Africa, and 12% in Central Africa (Table 3.1). The projected 2050
network contains an additional 51,795 km, the bulk of which (93%) are located in Eastern Africa.
The graphs in Figure 3.3 display the breakdown of the existing network and 2050 network by
region and country. In Central Africa, which contains the smallest portion of the overall PIDA+
network, most of the roadways are located in Sudan and Chad. In Eastern Africa, the bulk of the
roadways are located in Kenya and Ethiopia. Ethiopia is the country where the bulk of the new
projects are projected to occur by 2050. South Africa contains the largest portion of the network
in Southern Africa, and in Sub-Saharan Africa overall (approximately 608,000 km). Lastly, in
Western Africa, Nigeria contains the largest portion of the network. The 2050 network contains

    Sudan and Mauritania are in UNECA’s North Africa region but for the purposes of this study are included in Central
    Africa and Western Africa, respectively.

PAP projects included in the PIDA+ network are paved roads; the country-level projects and
existing road network are mostly unpaved. Appendix A provides a detailed breakdown of the
inventory by country and road type.

The PIDA PAP projects accounted for in this study reflect 11 multi-country transport projects,
comprising 111 individual road segment investments, with a total investment of approximately
US$33 billion. The PIDA+ inventory includes an additional 261 projects across 30 countries, with
an estimated investment cost of US$45 billion. The combined “PIDA+” reference investment
scenario therefore represents an approximate combined capital investment rate of US$4.6 billion
per year, for a total of US$78 billion.

As a benchmark to this investment scenario, the AICD study concluded that road infrastructure
spending needs for SSA amount to an average of 1.5% of GDP per year (US$5.98 billion/year in
capital costs, plus US$3.65 billion/year in operations and maintenance costs; Carruthers et al.,
2008). We therefore estimate that this study’s reference investment scenario represents 77% of
the AICD-identified capital investment needs for SSA.

3.4        Estimates of Traffic Volumes in the SSA Road Network
Information on traffic volumes for the SSA road network is only sparsely available. In particular,
there is no comprehensive dataset available to characterize road volumes that might be useful in
interpreting the road disruption results presented in Chapter 6. There is, however, a source of
attributed traffic volume data that relies on expert judgments of traffic volumes by road class
(primary, secondary, and tertiary) and type (paved and unpaved) (Gwilliam, 2011). The Project
Team employed the attributed data on traffic volumes by road class, with the inventory data by
road class, to estimate traffic volumes by country for the paved and unpaved road categories. The
results are presented in Table 3.2 below, and are also used in Chapter 6 to understand the likely
range of values that might be appropriate for avoid disruption times. Two methods were used to
develop these estimates, which could be interpreted as a range of values. Method 1 uses estimates
of the road distribution by class and length from Gwilliam (2011), and Method 2 relies on estimates
of the road distribution by class and length from this study.

Climate Change Projections in Africa
Brent Boehlert, Kenneth M. Strzepek, and James E. Neumann


This chapter describes the methods used to develop the broad set of climate projections that are
used in this study, which are used as inputs in the impacts and adaptation analyses in the
subsequent chapters. The methods generated 95 individual representations of climate futures
through 2050 that span a wide range of GHG emissions scenarios and GCMs applied in the United
Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recent Fourth and Fifth
assessment reports (AR4 and AR5). This chapter also discusses how the approach to climate
change projection used here complements the one used in the World Bank’s “Turn Down the
Heat” (TDH) series of reports.
Figuring out how exactly infrastructure development should be modified to take climate change
into account is difficult because of the large uncertainty in climate projections. Since no consensus
has yet emerged in the climate science community on how to assign probabilities to alternative
climate futures, approaches have been suggested to identify “robust decisions” (i.e., those that
perform well compared to the alternatives over a wide range of plausible futures). The first step
toward applying such an approach is to define the “uncertainty domain” (i.e., define across the
continent a range of climate projections that adequately capture uncertainty about climate
processes and is reflected in the wide range of GCMs, as well as uncertainty about future GHG
emissions pathways). This chapter reviews methods for developing such a range of climate futures
and presents the climate change scenarios used in this assessment.

4.1      Developing Climate Change Projections
The process of developing climate change projections generally includes four elements:
      1. Characterize history: Select a representation of the historical climate that will be used to
         relate the projection to existing conditions. This step also involves selecting the spatial and
         temporal scales for the analysis.
      2. Characterize the principal climate change drivers: Select a GHG emissions pathway that
         represents a reasonable projection of the phenomenon believed to drive future climate
         change.
      3. Process the emissions data in a climate model: Use one or more GCMs to process the
         emissions projection to develop trajectories of climate indicators (such as temperature and
         precipitation).
      4. Relate the model projections to historical data : Relate the projections to historical
         information on temporal and spatial variability of current climate, while also taking into

                                                   50
       account information from climate models about how these patterns could change in the
       future.
At each step of the above process, there are both choices and uncertainties, and while some
consensus exists concerning how to complete each step, multiple valid alternatives exist. As a
result, there are many reasonable projections of future climate for a given location and time
period. It is significant, however, that climate scientists have not reached consensus about the
relative likelihood of these multiple projections.
In light of this circumstance, the study team has chosen to employ climate information from
several emissions scenarios and climate models, as well as multiple bias correction and spatial
downscaling techniques. Bias correction is a process of using measured historical climate
information to normalize the outputs from the models – effectively ensuring that what we take
from each climate model is a representation of the modeled differences they imply between
historical and future climate conditions. Spatial downscaling (and/or spatial disaggregation) is a
process of enhancing the spatial resolution of the relatively crude spatial projections from climate
models, through judicious use of historical information. Both bias correction and spatial
disaggregation (BCSD), as well as downscaling processes, derive from the conclusion that it would
be inappropriate to use the results of climate models directly; instead, it is better to use historical
climate information to ground the results. Each of the approaches used for developing
disaggregated or downscaled future climate projections is defensible scientifically and provides
information on different possible realizations of future climates. Box 4.1 provides technical details
on the procedures applied.
The result of this approach is a characterization of the historical climate for SSA, which is necessary
to provide a clear representation of natural variability in climate systems, and a total of
95 alternative representations of the climate future, each of which can be used to estimate the
impacts of climate change on infrastructure performance, and the adaptation options that can be
deployed to respond to those impacts. The approach utilized in this study to develop climate
projections complements the one adopted by the Turn Down the Heat (TDH) series of reports
(World Bank, 2012; Potsdam Institute, 2013), as discussed in detail in Box 4.2.

Box 4.1. A Technical Summary of the Methods for Developing Climate Futures
Historical climate sequences. This analysis uses data from the Terrestrial Hydrology Research Group at
Princeton University; the data are organized in a grid at a 0.5 degree resolution (approximately 50 km)
covering Africa for the 1948–2008 time period. This dataset merges what is currently one of the most
comprehensive collections of daily observed records from the Global Historical Climatology Network
(GHCN) with a number of re-analysis and satellite or satellite/station merged gridded datasets.

Disaggregated global climate projections of future climate using the BCSD method. The BCSD method is
a development of pattern scaling, incorporating quantile mapping to account for GCM biases in rainfall-
intensity distributions. The strengths of this method are that the projections show strong agreement
with GCM projected changes at the large scale, and that the method produces a de-biased future
projected time series, which greatly eases the application to impact modeling, particularly hydrology.
The Track I, basin, and power-pool scale analyses use results of two classes of climate models, which were
supported as part of IPCC’s two most recent assessments: AR4 and AR5, published in 2007 and 2013,
respectively. For this study, daily results for the 2001–2050 time period are needed. The IPCC AR4
provided data from 22 GCMs, which were evaluated across three emissions scenarios. Because not all
models were deployed for all three emissions scenarios, this yields a total of 56 emissions-GCM
combinations for our use. These results were processed using the BCSD method to produce a daily time
series for a 50-year period, representing 2001–2050 at a 0.5 by 0.5 degree resolution grid across Africa
for rainfall and temperature.
The IPCC AR5 provides suitable data from 9 GCMs, and the study team employed results for two
emissions pathways, labeled Reference Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5, corresponding to
a “medium” and “high” emissions scenario, respectively. RCP 8.5 corresponds to the emissions pathway
often emphasized in characterizations of the World Bank’s recent report, Turn Down the Heat: Why a
4°C Warmer World Must Be Avoided. Combining the GCMs and emissions scenarios yields a total of
17 additional emissions-GCM combinations (9 driven by RCP 4.5 and 8 driven by RCP 8.5 emissions),
which were also downscaled using the BCSD method.

An additional 22 climate futures (11 GCMs driven by the 4.5 and 8.5 RCP emissions pathways) were
produced using an alternative downscaling technique, the Empirical-Statistical Downscaling Methods
developed at the Climate Systems Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town. This method relies on
different outputs from the GCMs in the downscaling process, focusing on the atmospheric pressure
results, which are then related to precipitation outcomes, rather than using the precipitation outcomes
directly from the GCMs.

Box 4.2. Comparison of Climate Projections in this Study to Those of the TDH Series of Reports
The projections used in this study reflect the broad base of climate science that underlies the last two
IPCC Assessment Reports – AR4 and AR5. One prominent recent World Bank-supported effort, the “Turn
Down the Heat” (TDH) series of reports (World Bank, 2012; Potsdam Institute, 2013), relies on the most
recent IPCC climate science base, the AR5, as well. The TDH reports use the same AR5 emissions
scenarios (i.e., RCPs) and the same set of AR5 GCMs as this report. Differences between the climate
projections presented in the TDH reports and this report come mainly from three sources:

  •   How the GCMs are used. Rather than using the GCM results as they are provided by the IPCC, the
      TDH reports present ensemble results by running a climate model ensemble of 600 realizations for
      each GHG emissions scenario. In the simulations, each ensemble member is driven by a different
      set of climate-model parameters that define the climate-system response, including parameters
      determining climate sensitivity, carbon cycle characteristics, and many others. Some filtering is
      then conducted, so that randomly drawn parameter sets that do not allow the climate model to
      reproduce a set of observed climate variables over the past centuries (within certain tolerable
      “accuracy” levels) are filtered out and not used for the projections, leaving the 600 realizations
      that are assumed to have adequate predictive skill. The current study, by contrast, uses the results
      of GCMs directly, and then conducts downscaling and bias-correction calculations for each of the
      individual GCM-emissions scenario combinations. In short, the TDH reports tend to focus on
      aggregate ensemble results, and this study tends to focus on ensemble members.
  •   How the emissions scenarios are used. The TDH reports rely mostly on two RCPs – 3.0 and 8.5.
      RCP 3.0 is a mitigation scenario, while RCP 8.5 is largely acknowledged to be a non-mitigation
      scenario. This study also uses RCP 8.5, but for the mitigation scenario relies on RCP 4.5, which
      reflects recent thinking that the failure to date to reach an international climate agreement on
      GHG emissions reductions makes the realization of RCP 3.0 less likely. This study also uses other
      emissions projections from the older AR4.
  •   How the time period of interest is defined. For most of their results, the TDH reports present
      outcomes for the mid-century, centered on 2050, and for the end of century, reflecting the 2080–
      2100 period. The use of “eras” to present mid-century and end-century results is appropriate for
      illustrating the temperature, precipitation, sea level rise, and extreme event endpoints that are
      the focus of the TDH reports, but results for eras typically are not used as inputs to biophysical and
      economic models of climate impacts. This study focuses on the period from the present to mid-
      century, or year 2050, which is relevant for decision-making for new infrastructure in the next 15–
      20 years. A daily time series of climate projections is used to drive impact and adaptation models
      of the road sector.

The cumulative effect of these differences is that the climate scenarios used in this study span a broader
range of discrete climate model and emissions scenario outcomes than the TDH reports, which is
appropriate for the purposes of the current study, which is focused on methods for addressing
uncertainty in climate futures.

4.2    Temperature and Precipitation Forecasts in SSA
The results of our broad characterization of climate futures resulting from the above methods
indicates that a wide range of temperature and precipitation outcomes are possible across SSA.
Figure 4.1, Panel A, shows the temperature results (spatially-averaged) for Senegal, in West Africa,
both for the historical period and for the projection through 2100. Senegal was chosen simply as
an example of the types of climate information that are typically used in impact analysis, and to
illustrate several points that apply to climate analyses throughout SSA. As indicated in the figure,
all temperature forecasts show increases over time, but the magnitude of the increase for any
single projected trajectory can differ markedly, with estimates for the end of the century ranging
from a one-degree increase to a six-degree increase. Note also that estimates for the highest GHG
emissions scenario, the CMIP5-RCP8.5, show the highest degree of warming over time. These
patterns are similar throughout SSA.
Panel B of Figure 4.1 shows the comparable results for precipitation forecasts, also for Senegal. In
the case of precipitation, however, the overall results show almost no discernable trend, even
when the end of the century is considered. Instead, they are marked by a very high degree of both
year-to-year variability and cross-GCM variability. In addition, the higher-emissions scenarios (e.g.,
CMIP5-RCP8.5) tend to show more drying than the lower-emissions scenarios, at least at the end
of the century. Also note that the results shown are for the full 21st century, while in this study our
time horizon extends only to 2050.
A key point from this example is that in most all parts of Africa, there exists a particular historical
pattern, with areas within the Congo River Basin generally the wettest and areas in Southern Africa
the driest in SSA, but the projections show both drier and wetter futures than historical. For
example, comparable results for precipitation outcomes in the DRC and South Africa are shown in
Panels A and B, respectively, in Figure 4.2. These results support the point that the range of
alternative climate futures cannot be readily summarized as either wetter or drier than the
historical climate. Further, the dark lines for CMIP3 and CMIP5 in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show that
averages across GCMs clearly underestimate the variability that can result from a large portion of
individual GCM/emissions combinations. This finding reinforces the need to consider a framework
such as RDM (described in more detail in Chapter 2), which allows the analyst to consider a broad
range of individual future outcomes when making infrastructure planning decisions. With
uncertainty in the pattern of future climate, the possibility to over- or under-design climate
sensitive transport infrastructure is considerable; a wiser course of action is to consider the
outcomes of alternative infrastructure plans across the broadest feasible set of futures.

Below we present the results of the temperature and precipitation forecasting for five countries
in SSA: South Africa, Senegal, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and the DRC. These countries contain a variety of
climates that are representative of the range of climates across SSA. Figure 4.3 presents the
Köppen-Geiger climate classifications in Africa, highlighting the variety of zones found within the
five sample countries.

Figure 4.4 shows summary results in box and whisker form for the five example countries. The
temperature outcomes are most consistent across these five countries, and center on about 1.5°C
to 2°C. Precipitation outcomes, as noted above, vary more substantially across countries, as can

be seen in the center panel of Figure 4.4. In addition, the bottom panel provides a measure of
changes in flood risk, showing changes in the magnitude of the maximum daily precipitation event
in 2050 compared to the average 24-hour event for years in the baseline period. The interesting
result is that, even in situations where average annual precipitation may decline, changes in the
daily variation of precipitation volumes imply that flood risks could increase. This finding is
important for the design of culverts to carry runoff beneath road surfaces.

example countries throughout SSA




Another way to view the climate scenarios is shown in Figure 4.5, presented for the same five
sample countries of the DRC, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa. Here the vertical axis is
average mean temperature for the country, and the horizontal axis is average mean annual
precipitation. The X’s shown toward the bottom of the graphics show the historical climate,
corresponding to the measured Princeton historical baseline. Orange and red symbols indicate
CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections, respectively, and the various symbols in the legend provide an
indication of the emissions scenario. Observation of the range of red (CMIP5) versus orange
(CMIP3) precipitation outcomes in all five countries suggests that even with the most recent
advances in climate science implied by the progression from CMIP3 to CMIP5, the result does not


                                                 58
narrow uncertainty but reflects an increase in uncertainty. The conclusion provides another
important rationale for adopting the RDM methods used in this study in planning climate-sensitive
infrastructure deployment.

 Notes: CMIP3 corresponds to IPCC AR4 GCM results, CMIP5 corresponds to IPCC AR5 GCM results. Baseline

In general, the results presented in this chapter demonstrate that the historical temperatures are
lower than all of the temperature futures, but the historical precipitations generally sit in the
middle of the range of precipitation futures. The newer CMIP5 projections tend to represent the
more extreme temperature and precipitation projections (to the top and right of Figure 4.5,
respectively), particularly those for RCP 8.5, the “high-end” emissions scenario, shown as red
diamonds.
Looking across the countries, the relative positions of the historical results to the left or right of
the cluster of future climate projections give some indication of whether the study team can
expect a largely drier or largely wetter future in these basins. For example, the Ethiopia results
suggest more wetter than drier futures, while the South Africa results suggest there is some
possibility of a much drier basin. As noted above, however, there is no way to assign probabilities
to the 95 climate futures, so readers should not interpret likelihoods from these results. Rather, it

                                                     59
is useful to think of the climate futures as indicating a range of possibilities for each country that
are supported by the best current IPCC climate science, and therefore provide an initially plausible
space for thinking about the range of possible climate impacts (as outlined in Chapter 5), and the
range of climate futures that can be considered in future adaptation planning and design (as
presented in Chapter 6).
In addition, it is important to note that “drier” can ultimately be a combination of both
temperature and precipitation, as higher temperatures lead to higher evaporation from surface
waters, higher evapotranspiration from plants, and, as a result, lower runoff in rivers, all else equal
– this is most important in assessing flood risks. Finally, these figures provide a sense of the annual
mean values, but the impact and adaptation results presented in later chapters make use of daily
results for each country the study team considers. The monthly patterns of temperature, and
especially precipitation, vary considerably across SSA, and the more refined temporal patterns
have the most influence on impacts for road infrastructure.

4.3     Flooding Projections
For the roads analysis, the study forecasts the change in precipitation events within grid cells, on
a daily basis. The change in flood risk is characterized as the change in high daily precipitation
events. A distribution of high daily precipitation events is established for the historical climate
case, and the fifty-year baseline historical period is then use to calculate return periods for flood
events, as characterized by high daily precipitation events. The analysis then considers each
changed climate, and provides a daily time series of the changed occurrence of daily precipitation
events, which are in turn used in the IPSS model to characterize changes in the damage associated
with flooding. The road component does not consider the routing of water from one grid cell to
another.
Because bridges cross rivers, the flow in rivers is critically important to the effect on bridge footings
and/or overtopping. Therefore, a water flow routing analysis was conducted at the major basin
scale to capture the effect of precipitation events in multiple upstream grid cells, since these affect
flow in downstream grid cells that might contain bridges. At noted in Chapter 2, the bridges
analysis estimates impacts by first assuming that all current bridges are resilient to the current 50-
year flood, and then a damage function is applied for river flow events corresponding to the 75-
year and 100-year flood in future climates. The flood flow analysis provides an estimate of the
current 50-year, 75-year, and 100-year flood events by grid cell. The logic for the extra effort
required to estimate river flow for the bridges analysis is that the effect of flooding on bridges is
related to scouring of the bridge footings, which sit in the river itself. As described in Wright et al.
(2012), bridges are mainly vulnerable to bank erosion and scour related to flood events.

CHAPTER 5

Risks of Inaction
Paul Chinowsky, Xavier Espinet, and Jacob Helman


This chapter presents the results of the “reactive response” analysis. This analysis examines a
scenario in which no proactive measures are taken to protect infrastructure from climate change
impacts, and instead measures are taken after the impacts have occurred. In this scenario, the
costs of climate change are the costs of the response, which include incremental maintenance and
repairs between major rehabilitation cycles to restore the roads to their pre-climate change
condition, as well as the costs of disruption when the roads are out of service. The reactive
response analysis illustrates the “risks of inaction” or the vulnerability of the infrastructure to
climate change.
As described in Chapter 2, the analysis relies on the IPSS tool to analyze the impacts of three
specific climate stressors: temperature, precipitation, and flooding. Each road segment is analyzed
using a stressor-response method and compared with a baseline of historical climate data. The
analysis then quantifies the incremental costs of the reactive responses, presented in Table 5.1
(repeated from Chapter 2, to remind readers of the specific reactive response measures that are
considered in the risks of inaction analysis). The reactive strategies are based on specific
thresholds for each stressor and road type. For the reactive response analysis, roads are built
based on historic climate standards, and assuming, for the comparability reasons discussed in
chapter 2, full maintenance routines. When climate change stressors exceed thresholds, damages
are incurred through increased maintenance activities necessary to preserve the integrity of the
road for its original design lifespan. The costs associated with these responses are based on figures
provided by roadway design and management practitioners and reflect local construction and
maintenance costs.

5.1      Risk to SSA of a Reactive Response to Climate Change
Across SSA, the mean costs (across climate scenarios) of climate change for the PIDA+ network
associated with the reactive response scenario are estimated at $56 billion for 2015-50 (6%
discount rate), compared to historic climate costs of about $15 billion. The uncertainty across
climates is very substantial, however, with the 95th percentile values as much as three times larger
than the mean, and the 5th percentile values almost indistinguishable from the baseline, no climate
change costs. Figure 5.1 presents the reactive response costs associated with each climate stressor
(temperature, precipitation, and flooding), and also includes historical costs for reference.
Specifically, the figure shows the costs of conducting maintenance on the PIDA+ road network
between major rehabilitation cycles in response to climate-induced damages to restore roads to
their pre-climate change condition. Periodic rehabilitation costs are included in the baseline.



                                                   62
As shown, costs associated with all three stressors are projected to increase relative to historic
costs, particularly costs associated with flooding. Across the PIDA+ network, the highest reactive
response costs are associated with projected changes in precipitation (the mean estimated cost is
$32 billion for 2015-50, 6% discount rate). This is due to the fact that changes in precipitation have
serious impacts on unpaved roads, which represent the majority of the PIDA+ network (72%). The
effect of the temperature stressor is more modest because temperature does not affect unpaved
roads and because there are already high temperatures across SSA, so the incremental effect of
additional temperature increases due to climate change is relatively small. As noted by the green
diamond in the figure, costs based on historical climate are at or near the bottom of the range
estimated with forecasted climate change. The estimated costs can be as much as 10 times higher
than historical costs for the temperature and precipitation stressors, and as much as 17 times
higher for the flooding stressor. The maximum risks of inaction are clearly very much larger than
historical maintenance costs.
Figure 5.2 shows the reactive response costs for the PIDA PAP projects only. As shown, the relative
effect of the precipitation stressor is reduced because the PIDA PAP projects include only paved
roads.

Figure 5.3 illustrates the effect of the choice of discount rate on the reactive response costs for
the PIDA+ network. As shown, costs are substantially higher when using a 3% discount rate
compared to a 6% discount rate. This is because the majority of the impacts are expected to occur
later in the time period.

The discount rate effect is closely related to the timing of these impacts, which are in turn linked
to the timing of the climate changes which cause the impacts. The top panel of Figure 5.4 provides
an indication of the incidence of reactive costs by decade, using an aggregate measure for all
climate stressors and all regions; the lower panel shows the same measure for all regions, but for
the temperature stressor only. The lower end of the box shows the 5th percentile climate result,
the top shows the 95th, and the middle line shows the mean. The results indicate the increasing
trend in the timing of reactive costs over the course of the study period, with a relatively large
increase in the early period and a shallow trend line for the mean result over time. The trajectory
of costs for the temperature stressor, though, is steeper. The reasons for these trends are that
costs for all stressors are dominated by the precipitation results; that costs for the precipitation
stressor include an early component that reflects “catch-up” investments, which close the current
climate adaptation gap; and that, as indicated in Chapter 4, the precipitation changes at the SSA
level show relatively small changes from the mean, with relatively larger changes in variance over
time (note that the trend in the 5th percentile results shows nearly no increase over time). For
temperature, as indicated in Chapter 4, there is a more pronounced upward trend across all
climate scenarios.

Recent global agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions might be expected to reduce these
risks of inaction for the road network, when they are fully realized, but the reduction associated
with GHG mitigation are much less effective than might be expected, at least through the 2050
time horizon of the study. Figure 5.5 shows the estimated reactive response costs for the PIDA+
network for two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories: RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. RCP 8.5 is a

                                                         66
scenario of comparatively high greenhouse gas concentrations, resulting from a continued
increase in emissions throughout the 21st century. RCP 4.5 is a scenario in which emissions peak
around 2040 and then decline and level off due to mitigation efforts. As shown in the figure, costs
are projected to increase under both scenarios relative to historical costs. The estimated costs of
inaction for the road network under RCP 4.5 are reduced compared to RCP 8.5, but not as much
as may be expected. This suggests that mitigation at the RCP 4.5 level, which does not guarantee
a specific limit on temperature increases for all locations or in all climate change projections, would
not substantially lower impacts to the SSA road network.
One reason underlying this finding is the 2050 time horizon. The differences in emissions between
RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 are relatively modest through 2040, and differences in outcomes in SSA are
most pronounced after 2050. Greenhouse gas mitigation remains an important priority for African
countries for multiple sectors, and if the study considered a longer time horizon it would likely
demonstrate the importance of mitigation for the road transport sector as well. However, a key
lesson from this study is that mitigation alone is not sufficient to alleviate impacts in this sector,
which puts yet more emphasis on the urgency for robust adaptation planning.

In addition to increased maintenance costs, the reactive response approach is projected to result
in a high degree of disruption to the PIDA+ network. As described in Chapter 2, disruption is the
time out-of-service for the PIDA+ roads during the maintenance and repair activities resulting from



                                                             67
climate change impacts. The analysis quantifies disruption in terms of out-of-service days for roads
in the network.
As shown in Figure 5.6, a reactive response to the precipitation stressor results in an estimated
46-88 million disruption days, compared to 50 million days historically. The increase in disruption
for the reactive response mode, associated with an increase in the need for repair of road surfaces
and sub-grades, is in the worst climate up to 2.5 times historic disruption for the temperature
stressor; 76% higher for the precipitation stressor; and 14 times higher for the flooding stressor.

Disruption of the Africa road network clearly results in substantial economic costs, as goods and
people are prevented from moving freely or engaging in economic activity. Unfortunately, data on
traffic volumes, effective network redundancy (allowing for alternative routing), or the economic
value of avoiding disruptions is not available for most parts of SSA. A single day of disruption likely
restricts many person-days of activity, though this effect may be mitigated in places where there
is a high degree of road network redundancy. The typical rule of thumb for valuation of traffic
disruption is to use 50 percent of the daily wage as a proxy for the lost opportunity cost of time –
using reasonable valuation estimates, then, disruption might lead to additional damages in the
billions to tens of billions of dollars, associated with individual days of road closure for repairs.
Even this value, however, excludes the broader macroeconomic implications of restricted travel
and economic activity that extends to multiple economic sectors (e.g., associated with spoilage of
agricultural products or lost tourism revenue). Two country-level examples provide insights on the


                                                                   68
possible magnitude of transportation disruption effects. In Mozambique, analysts estimated that
transport disruption associated with climate change could cost the economy roughly $2.5 billion
per year from 2010 to 2050, compared to a current annual GDP of $15.6 billion (Arndt and
Thurlow, 2015). In South Africa, a similar analysis found that transport disruption could cost 0.8%
of GDP (with a range of 0.1 to 2.6% across climate futures) by 2050; South Africa’s current GDP is
over $350 billion. The cumulative cost over the 2015 to 2050 period (5% discount rate) would be
$16 billion (mean across climate forecasts), with a range of $1.5 to $55 billion (Cullis et al., 2015).

5.2        Regional Impacts of a Reactive Response
The effects of climate change on roads vary considerably by region. 5 Reactive response costs for
the PIDA+ network are estimated to be highest in the Southern Africa region, but costs for the
PIDA PAP projects are highest in Eastern and Central Africa. This is due to the fact that there are
relatively few PIDA PAP projects in Southern Africa compared to the Eastern and Central regions.
Again, the highest estimated costs in both cases are those associated with the precipitation
stressor, which has the largest impact on the vast existing unpaved road network throughout SSA.
It is useful to consider how reactive response costs vary across climate stressors and regions.
Figure 5.7 (panel a) presents such an evaluation for the PIDA+ network, and Figure 5.7 (panel b)
for the PIDA PAP projects only. In both figures, the vertical axis is normalized (at 100) to the historic
(no-climate-change) costs. Bars that are higher than the 100 line represent costs of climate change
and bars below the line indicate potential savings. As shown, the flooding stressor leads to
relatively higher increases in costs relative to historic across the regions for both the PIDA+
network and PIDA PAP projects. Cost increases are particularly high in the Central and Western
regions.

    A map of the regions is presented in Figure 3.2. The regions are based on the regions used by the United Nations
    Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). Sudan and Mauritania are in UNECA’s North Africa region but for the
    purposes of this study are included in Central Africa and Western Africa, respectively.

5.3     Reactive Response Costs by Country
The analysis examines reactive response costs for the five representative SSA countries highlighted
in other areas of the report (DRC, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa). The relative results
by stressor vary across the five countries (Figure 5.8), consistent with variation in historical and
forecast climates across SSA. For example, the highest estimated costs for DRC ($4 billion) are
associated with the flooding stressor, while the highest estimated costs for Senegal ($16 million)
are associated with the precipitation stressor. It is interesting to note that for Senegal the historical
costs associated with the precipitation stressor are slightly higher than the minimum estimated
reactive response costs – suggesting that while some climate futures could be more benign than
the historical climate, and lead to lower costs of road maintenance, this effect is small and
effectively inconsequential.
Overall, costs are highest in South Africa due to the fact that it contains 21% of the 2050 PIDA+
network, while the other countries contain only 1-8%. In addition, within South Africa the majority
of the network (74%) is unpaved, making it particularly vulnerable to precipitation and flooding
stressors.

vertical scale, normalized to historic climate costs. Results vary by country but show the potential
for a very large increase in reactive costs for the 95th percentile of climate scenarios (shown in
orange), with countries on the left side of the graph showing potential for costs over 100 times
the current climate maintenance requirements. Costs for the 5th percentile climate (shown in blue)
indicate that under scenarios of mild climate change, costs could be close to historic costs in most
countries.

to withstand current climate, making areas that are relatively cool or dry potentially more
vulnerable as climate gets hotter and/or wetter), and the distribution of road types, with unpaved

5.4      Risks of Inaction for SSA Bridges
Climate change also has significant impacts on Africa’s bridge network. Although no
comprehensive inventory of bridges exists for the continent, this study estimates there are
approximately 330,000 bridges across SSA (see Section 2.6 for a description of the methods used
to develop the study’s bridge inventory). Based on the size of their respective road crossings,
approximately 230,000 (69%) of these bridges are small (associated with tertiary roads), 76,000

bridge inventory is $18 billion for 2015-50 (6% discount rate), 6 compared to a historical cost of
about $5 billion (see Figure 5.11 below). Costs vary by climate scenario, however, with the 5th
percentile climate showing costs of $7.6 billion, a 50% increase over historic costs, and the 95th
percentile showing costs of just over $35 billion, 7 times the historic cost. Climate change
therefore very clearly presents a substantial risk to Africa’s bridges, across all projected future
climates, and to the vital connectivity they provide for the transport network.

The risks of inaction to the PIDA+ road and bridge network presented in this chapter highlight the
need to consider an alternate course of action in the face of climate change risks – one that makes
use of climate forecasts and strategically enhances the resiliency of infrastructure to potential
future impacts through preventative adaptation measures. Chapter 6 presents the results of the
proactive adaptation analysis and examines the potential savings of this approach compared to
the reactive response strategy.

Adaptation Analysis

The objective of the adaptation analysis is to determine where and under what conditions it is
advantageous to enhance the resiliency of infrastructure to potential future impacts through
proactive adaptation, and where and under what conditions is it more cost-effective to take a
reactive response. The analysis compares costs under the proactive adaptation scenario to costs
under the reactive response scenario for the PIDA and PIDA+ networks, for a near-term time
period (2015-2030) and a long-term time period (2015-2050). 7 We first examine the results at the
continental (SSA-wide) level to determine what key messages emerge for SSA as a whole. We then
look at the results at the country level.
In addition, the analysis compares disruption (quantified as the time out-of-service resulting from
climate-induced impacts) under the proactive adaptation and reactive response scenarios. To
determine whether proactive adaptation can be financially justified when taking into considering
the costs of disruption, we examine the “breakeven point” where the value of time lost because
of disruption is large enough to justify the adoption of a proactive approach. This analysis provides
additional insights for adaptation planning.

6.1        Assessment of Proactive Adaptation across SSA
Across SSA, the mean costs of climate change for the PIDA+ network associated with the reactive
response scenario are estimated at $56 billion for 2015-50 (6% discount rate), 10 times the
historical costs, and range, across climate scenarios, from about 50% higher to 7 times higher than
historical costs. Proactive action has the potential to reduce those impacts, if properly focused.
Figure 6.1 below shows the savings from proactive adaptation in response to the three climate
stressors (temperature, precipitation, and flooding) for the PIDA paved roads (panel a) and the

    Adaptation of the road and bridge system to climate change should ideally reflect the vintage of the roads and
    bridges analyzed, with specific estimates of when the rehabilitation and replacement cycles occur. For the PIDA
    component of the road inventory, the expected build date provides information to trigger the start of a maintenance
    cycle, followed a rehabilitation action when useful life of the road is effectively exhausted. With useful life of 20 to
    30 years, many roads in the inventory will undergo major rehabilitation twice during the full study period, perhaps
    once prior to 2030, and once after 2030 – and in the meantime, climate change will be progressing. This reality
    provides the logic for looking at the two periods. Data limitations on the actual vintage of existing roads, however,
    require a statistical approach to determining the age of capital for the non-PIDA portion of the inventory. As a result,
    there are limitations on the ability to look more carefully at distinct rehabilitation cycles in the pre-2030 versus post-
    2030 periods.

                                                              78
PIDA+ paved (panel b) and unpaved (panel c) roads. 8 The results are for 2015-50 (6% discount
rate). For the PIDA roads (panel a), proactive adaptation in response to the temperature stressor
results in mean savings of approximately $80 million. For the precipitation and flooding stressors,
however, broad application of proactive action leads to negative savings (i.e. losses) in several
climate scenarios, suggesting that a blanket approach to invest in resilience to precipitation and
flooding stressors across all PIDA projects is not cost-effective.
For the PIDA+ paved roads (panel b), proactive adaptation results in savings only in certain
climates, but the mean savings are negative (losses), suggesting that here, too, more analysis is
needed to determine when and where to take proactive action. For unpaved roads (panel c),
proactive adaptation in response to both the precipitation and flooding stressors leads to losses,
with particularly large losses for the precipitation stressor. 9 In the PIDA+ network, which has a high
percentage of existing unpaved, gravel roads, proactive adaptation to increase resilience to the
precipitation stressor largely involves adding pavement, which proves to be prohibitively costly
and does not adequately reduce periodic maintenance costs.
There are, however, arguments for investing in proactive adaptation in response to the
precipitation and flooding stressors for both the PIDA and PIDA+ road inventories. The following
sections explore the circumstances under which this investment is justified for certain geographic
scales and/or to avoid disruption impacts. In addition, we examine the costs of proactive
adaptation within the context of overall PIDA investment costs.

6.2       Assessment of Proactive Adaptation at the Country Level
In this section, we examine the country-level results of the proactive adaptation analysis. We focus
on the PIDA+ road network, where proactive adaptation is not always financially justified at the
national level, as described in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.2 shows the 5th and 95th percentile of cost
savings under the proactive adaptation scenario for the PIDA+ network by country for the period
2015-2015 (6% discount rate) in response to temperature (panel a and b), precipitation (panels c
and d), and flooding (panels e and f). A comparison of the country-level results suggests the
following conclusions:

      •   In many countries, proactive adaptation in response to the temperature stressor is often
          financially justified for paved roads (panel a and b), particularly when focused on the new
          PIDA paved roads (panel a). Even in the milder scenarios of climate change (approximated
          by the 5th percentile of the distribution of climate outcomes, represented by the blue dot
          in the graphs), proactive adaptation is financially justified for many countries where the
          blue dot is above or close to the green line, which represents historic costs. For these
          countries, proactive adaptation of paved roads presents low or no regrets, because savings
          are nearly guaranteed. The case for proactive adaptation for the mostly existing (PIDA+)
          paved roads (panel b) is more mixed.
      •   Proactive adaptation in response to the precipitation stressor results in losses for the
          majority of countries for both paved and unpaved roads (panels c and d, respectively). This
          is particularly true for unpaved roads, where the only adaptation available is to pave the
          roads, which is very costly. For roads that are currently paved, there are many countries
          for which the 95th percentile climate outcome shows positive savings. Where the 5th
          percentile shows relatively small losses, there is a good chance that consideration of
          disruption costs may tilt the balance toward proactive action (see Figure 6.4).
      •   For the flooding stressor, the financial savings potential across climate outcomes appears
          to be larger for unpaved (panel f) than for paved roads (panel e), because of the lower
          costs associated with modifying unpaved roads to accept a larger culvert beneath the road
          bed (that is, there are higher costs for the proactive action to raise a paved road than an
          unpaved road so a larger culvert can be placed beneath it).

6.3      Reducing Disruption Time through Proactive Adaptation
This section examines how proactive adaptation affects disruption of the PIDA+ road network
(quantified as the time out-of-service resulting from climate-induced damages). Figure 6.3 shows
the total disruption days under the reactive and proactive approaches for the three stressors. As
shown, the reactive response approach results in greater disruption than proactive adaptation.
Because this cumulative physical effects measure is difficult to reliably monetize, the key question
is therefore whether savings in maintenance costs, plus avoided disruption, is sufficient to justify
a proactive adaptation approach for roads; this is discussed in the next section.

6.4                                   Evaluating the Combined Financial and Time Benefits of adaptation
In addition to the financial analysis presented in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, it is also important for
decision makers to take into consideration the effect of proactive adaptation on disruption time.
Due to the fact that it is difficult to monetize disruption, this analysis instead identifies for each
climate scenario the “breakeven” point at which the value of the avoided disruption time is large
enough to justify the incremental construction costs of adaptation. Disruption is measured using
a measure of a road’s days out of service – but a better measure of disruption needs to consider
traffic volumes – i.e., the number of trips that are disrupted, not the number of days the road is
impassable. When interpreting the results of a break-even analysis, a low breakeven value implies
the economic value of disrupted trips does not need to be very high to make up for the incremental
construction cost resulting from adaptation. In these cases, proactive adaptation may be justified.
Conversely, if a breakeven value is high, proactive adaptation may not be justified to the extent
that the value of disrupted trips must is not high enough to justify the incremental construction
costs.
By comparing the breakeven values to a plausible estimate of the value of avoided time lost, road
planners can better assess the merits of adaptation. Where breakeven values are higher than the

                                                                               88
estimated value of avoided time lost, proactive adaptation is not justified. However, breakeven
values vary, depending on the climate change scenario considered. A simple way to deal with the
resulting uncertainty is to look at scenarios of relatively mild climate change, where breakeven
values will be higher (e.g. the 95th percentile of the distribution).
If the opportunity cost of time lost because of disruption is deemed higher than the high-end
breakeven value, then proactive adaptation will be justified since the time benefits will be even
higher in scenarios of more severe climate change.
Figures 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6 present the per-person, per-day breakeven values, adjusted for the
distribution of traffic volume, by country, for the three climate stressors. In all three cases, the
analysis uses an estimate of the value of a day of disruption per vehicle of $10. The average daily
wage for most workers varies considerably across Sub-Saharan Africa, from roughly $30 per day
in countries such as South Africa and Botswana, to as little as $3.50 per day in countries such as
Ethiopia and Uganda, according to UN International Labor Organization data. Unfortunately, the
ILO data address only a few of the countries in the study scope. For our purposes, using $10 per
day as a rough benchmark value of an avoided day of disruption, per vehicle (a vehicle which may
include multiple travelers), helps us to interpret the results.
In Figure 6.4, which refers to the temperature stressor, it is clear that in all countries except for
the few on the far left of the graphic, the high-end breakeven values (approximated by the 95th
percentile of the distribution) are less than $10 per day. The conclusion that follows is that, once
disruption is considered, adaptation to the temperature stressor for all paved roads in these
countries is justified. Consideration of disruption, when compared to the conclusions for the
financial analysis alone, provides a justification not only for the new PIDA roads, but also for the
rest of the existing and planned road network. Further, with deeper, in country analysis, the results
could yield information about the optimal timing of these adaptations for the existing road
network, through examination of the current climate, current road condition, and use of spatial
projections of climate change available in the study dataset (at the 50 km by 50 km level).

end (approximated by the 95th percentile) breakeven value below $10 per vehicle-day is seen for
all climate stressors, on the right of the graphics. These countries have both a high avoided
disruption associated with adaptation, and relatively high unpaved road traffic volumes, relative
to other countries in the scope of the study.

Road planners are likely to have more granular information, compared to what was possible to
obtain for this study, on expected traffic volumes, redundancy at the road network level, and unit
value of travel time. Using such data, the approach proposed in this report enables planners to
make more informed decisions on whether a proactive adaptation response is justified in any
particular project, in anticipation to climate change.

6.5          Costs of Proactive Adaptation for the PIDA Investments Across SSA
Analysis of the incremental investment required for proactive adaptation of the PIDA roads
investments finds that only a relatively small additional investment is needed to achieve this goal
(Figure 6.7). Most of the PIDA investments analyzed here are planned to occur by 2030 (many
have projected construction completion dates in 2030), and the total baseline cost (i.e., with no
adaptation) is estimated at $12.8 billion. For 50% of the future climates (between the 25th and 75th
percentiles), resilience investments for all stressors would cost between $13.9 and $15 billion,
with a mean cost of $14.5 billion (13% higher than the baseline). The 5 th to 95th percentile range
in the first period is $13.3 to $15.7 billion. The baseline costs in the later period are lower, at $3.5
billion, but the incremental cost is roughly proportional to that in the prior period.

to begin construction in the 2015 to 2030 period; right bar is for projects scheduled to begin construction in the 2031 to 2050

These incremental costs of adaptation can also be assessed by stressor, and by corridor, as shown
in the three panels of Figure 6.8. The results show that the incremental cost to achieve resilience
to the temperature stressor is much lower, between 1% and 3% of the baseline cost, for the five
largest cost PIDA corridors in our scope, but costs to achieve resilience to the precipitation and

                                                                95
flooding stressors are higher. For example, in Corridor 6, mean costs across climate scenarios to
achieve resilience to precipitation are about 13% of construction costs, but for the 95th percentile
climate they could be as high as 23%. These results suggest that a targeted approach to resilience,
over both stressors and corridors, may be appropriate.

6.6     Assessment of Proactive Adaptation for Bridges
The previous chapter established that the cost of inaction for bridges is high for most parts of SSA.
The cost of adaptation is likely to be high too. Figure 6.9 shows the reactive cost, proactive cost,
and cost savings for historic climate and the 91 climate forecasts across SSA, disaggregated by
region. In all regions, proactive costs of bridge adaptation are higher than reactive costs, and with
the exception of a few extreme scenarios, cost savings are negative (that is, proactive adaptation
is financially detrimental). A sensitivity analysis using a 3% discount rate yields somewhat better
results, but the mean savings from adaptation remain negative across all regions.

represents the mean value; and whiskers extending from box indicate the range from the 5th to the 95th percentile

climate.

In some countries, however, bridge adaptation may make good economic sense. In Nigeria and
DRC, for example, the net present value of proactive costs is generally lower than the cost of the
reactive response, as shown in Figure 6.10. The mean value of savings is slightly negative in both
countries. However, when disruption times are included, which are often much higher for bridges
than for roads because of the critical nature of bridge crossings in road networks, and the general
lack of bridge network redundancy, it is reasonable to conclude that adaptation of bridges may be
cost effective. The specific merits of the adaptation option will need to be assessed on a case-by-
case basis.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Raffaello Cervigni and Andrew Losos


7.1       Key Overall Insights from the Study
This book provides a framework for assessing climate related risks to road investments in Africa.
A key finding is that, in the period from the present to 2050, climate change could cause:

      •   Direct damages: tens of billions of dollars in damages to roads, which will require additional
          maintenance to preserve basic serviceability; preliminary estimation of damage to bridges
          suggests costs may be even higher (in the order of $30 billion, mean estimate).
      •   Substantial system disruption: apart from increasing maintenance costs, climate changes
          will cause the disruption of road links, interrupting the flow of goods and people, to the
          tune of 100 million days of disrupted road links by 2050, all of which has a substantial
          economic cost.
As noted in Chapter 1, while road and bridge infrastructure is a critical element in the development
of economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, many if not most African countries struggle to fund and
execute the maintenance of their road and bridge networks. One implication of the findings of this
study is that the prospect of climate change will increase the need for maintenance and
rehabilitation for all types of roads and bridges, in virtually all climate contexts, putting continued
pressure on an already stressed system.
A first key area of focus for transport sector authorities is therefore to incorporate climate change
in road asset management, with a particular focus on institutionalizing regular road maintenance.
Funding and adequately executing the regular functions of maintenance is a first key step towards
increasing the climate resilience of roads and bridge assets. The World Bank is promoting a range
of initiatives in this area, including a note on how to integrate climate change in road asset
management, and a new generation of road asset management systems, the International Study
of Road Asset Management and Models (ISRAMM). These efforts will help inform a consistent
approach to planning for climate resiliency across countries.

The study also points to a second area of recommendations, concerning engineering design
solutions as effective options to address the impacts of climate change. These solutions can
provide long-term resilience, with less disruption and lower lifetime maintenance costs, in
exchange for a higher up-front investment. In particular, this study finds that that investing
proactively in pavement improvements to withstand increased temperature is economically



                                                   100
justified under most climate projections, even without taking into account the cost of increased
disruption time.
On the other hand, the study finds that proactive adaptation to precipitation and flooding events
is more expensive, and is unlikely to be justified in the shorter term solely on the grounds of
reducing the lifetime expenditure on road assets (the sum total of construction, maintenance and
rehabilitation costs). For damage caused by these climate stressors, it is important to consider not
just financial costs but disruption of traffic volume and critical economic links.
As more severe precipitation and flooding changes will manifest themselves closer to mid-century,
and as the costs and risks of inaction grow larger over time, indications are the case for adaptation
(based on both the financial and the avoided disruption time) will grow stronger as well. In the
shorter term, it is important to avoid blanket prescriptions for infrastructure adaptations, opting
instead for specific interventions on resilient design, according to the circumstances of each
project and individual economic analyses.

7.2    Specific Recommendations
The framework of analysis developed in this study provide a basis for making recommendations
for the consideration of regional or sub-regional organizations (e.g., Africa Union Commission,
Regional Economic Communities), road sector ministries and agencies at the country level, along
with ministries of finances and planning; and international development partners, as described in
the table below.

Box 7.1. Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility (AFRI-RES)
To develop Africa's capacity to systematically integrate climate change considerations into the planning
and design of long-lived investments, the World Bank, the Africa Union Commission and the United
Nation Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) have teamed up to develop the Africa Climate Resilient
Investment Facility (Afri-Res). The facility will develop guidelines, provide training, deliver on-demand
advisory services, make data and knowledge tools more easily accessible, and ultimately help attract
funding from sources of development and climate finance.

The facility is one of the components of the World Bank Group’s $16 billion Africa Climate Business Plan
that      we       have      presented     at   COP21      in     Paris      in     November       2015
(http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/11/25481350/accelerating-climate-resilient-low-
carbon-development-africa-climate-business-plan).
Seed funding in the amount of 4 Million Euros has been pledged by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF),
and discussion are underway with other development partners to mobilize additional resources.

Note: The table does not include PIDA programs and projects that do not focus on improving connectivity through the
provision, or improvement, of road infrastructure. Examples of omitted projects include improvements to border
posts or airport facilities. The PAP is not static and will be updated regularly to reflect progress and make way for new
priorities as Africa’s needs continue to evolve.
In cases where cost estimates were not available from the PIDA data, these were estimated using Unit Rates for
similar projects.
