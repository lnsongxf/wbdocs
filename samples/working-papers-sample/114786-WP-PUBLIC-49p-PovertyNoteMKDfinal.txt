Executive Summary
FYR Macedonia has experienced a decline in poverty in the post global financial crisis period
(2009-2013) in spite of a weak macroeconomic performance. In contrast to the pre-crisis period
when growth was robust but poverty stagnant, poverty indicators for the most recent years indicate
an improvement on the living conditions of the bottom of the distribution. Poverty projections
based on GDP growth also indicate a continued decreasing trend in 2014 and 2015.
While before the crisis the incomes of the poor were less closely tied to overall economic growth,
after the crisis growth became pro-poor. The increased sensitivity of poverty to growth is explained
to a large extent by the bottom of the distribution growing closer to the rest rather than generalized
improvements along the entire income distribution. Employment gains were the main reason for
the increase in welfare among the less well-off after the crisis, while other income sources like
pensions, social assistance or remittances have played a very limited role. Labor income at the
bottom of the distribution continues to be very low, however, and the sustainability of the
employment gains is uncertain as the public sector played an important role for employment
expansion in the period. A reduction in labor incomes was the most important contributor of overall
negative income growth for those at the upper tail of the distribution.
Still, FYR Macedonia faces many challenges looking forward. Despite the recent improvements,
poverty and inequality is still high when compared with other countries with similar levels of GDP
per capita in the region. Low productivity growth is setting a bound for future wage increases.
Income-generation opportunities for the poor are limited as the poor have very weak labor market
attachment, their employment quality is lower than for the rest and are more likely to be employed
in low productivity sectors. Inclusive growth seem also to be challenged by the differences in
access to high wage jobs for women and the youth. Demographics seem important looking
forward, since they will shape future labor markets performance.

1. Introduction
Poverty statistics are critical to measure the success of economic policies in bringing greater
and sustained prosperity for all citizens. A detailed assessment of the evolution of living
standards allows policy makers to maintain the poor on the agenda, to target interventions toward
to the most vulnerable groups, and to monitor and evaluate projects designed to improve equity
and reduce poverty.

Poverty dynamics in Macedonia have been difficult to monitor in recent years on account of
a methodological change in 2010. Before 2010, official poverty estimates were measured using
a consumption aggregate based on data from the Household Budget Survey (HBS), using a relative
poverty line equivalent to 70% of median consumption. Other estimates were available, mainly by
the World Bank, using a national absolute poverty line. Starting in 2010 and with support from
Eurostat, FYR Macedonia State Statistics Office (SSO) moved to collecting household income
using the Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC), with the objective of producing poverty
and social statistics comparable with EU member countries. Poverty is now measured as 60% of
the median income, and the SILC has allowed the production of additional indicators, such as
material deprivation and low-work intensity, monitored as part of the Europe 2020 strategy for
reduction of poverty and social exclusion in the EU (European Commission, 2013). While positive
from a point of view of harmonizing statistical procedures with the European Union countries, the
changes introduced made difficult to compare poverty statistics before and after 2010 on account
of the differences in measurement of welfare.

Macedonia’s official poverty statistics in recent years are based on a relative measure, while
the World Bank reports absolute poverty levels. Measures of relative poverty are useful to
identify segments of the population that may be lagging considerably behind the rest of the country.
These measures usually rely on a point of the income distribution (e.g. median) to define a
threshold of poverty (e.g. 60 percent of median income) and hence the value of the relative poverty
line can change from one year to another. This, however, may lead to counterintuitive results when
measuring poverty over time. For instance, if the median income falls but there are no changes at
the bottom, the relative poverty rate would pick up a decrease in poverty when living conditions
have not changed at the bottom. The World Bank, in contrast, reports estimates based on fixed
poverty lines that aim to capture a minimum standard of living. Usually, these lines are defined at
the national level and are tied to the cost of a minimum basket of goods for subsistence. In absence
of these, the World Bank reports absolute poverty based on international poverty lines, as the
$1.9/day 2011 PPP or the $3.1 2011 PPP used in this report.
This report deepens the poverty analysis from previous notes by taking advantage of a longer
series of microdata recently made available (2010-2014). A first glance of the post-2009 poverty
indicators was presented in the 2015 Macedonia Poverty Note (World Bank, 2015), though the
limited span of time for which microdata was available (2010-2011 with reference to income
earned in 2009-2010) limited the possible analysis of dynamics. More recently, new rounds of
microdata from the SILC (2012-2014 with reference to income earned in 2011-2013) have been
made available by the SSO through on-site access, making possible to analyze poverty changes.
This note reports these trends and analyzes the changes observed, linking performance to
indicators of labor markets, social assistance and remittances to understand the drivers of changes
in living conditions at the bottom of the distribution. Due to limited access to microdata, these
other indicators come from published results of nationally representative surveys, like the Labor
                                                 7
Force Survey or surveys of business and enterprises, and from administrative records publicly
available. For internal consistency, the analysis refers to the years 2009-2013.
The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section 2 describes trends of poverty,
inequality and shared prosperity in FYR Macedonia over time. Section 3 discusses the main
changes in labor markets and other sources of income that could have explained changes in living
conditions and poverty over the period 2009-2013. Section 4 presents the profile of the poor and
how it changed between 2009 and 2013. Section 5 presents the main challenges for poverty
reductions looking forward. Section 6 concludes.

2. Evolution of Poverty, Inequality and Shared Prosperity
Macedonia enjoyed high growth rates until the global financial crisis, but growth has since
decelerated. Economic growth averaged 4.4 percent annually before the crisis (2003-2008),
compared to 1.6 percent in the post-crisis period (2009-2013). Moreover, growth has been volatile
in the post-crisis period (Figure 1). Recovery was sluggish in 2010, and recession returned in 2012,
when the economy contracted by 0.6 percentage points on account of factors associated with the
European debt crisis and extreme weather conditions that affected the Western Balkans.

Despite the weaker macroeconomic performance in the post global financial crisis period,
Macedonia has made progress in reducing relative poverty. Relative poverty (60% of median
household per adult equivalent income, see Box 1) decreased, from 27.6 percent in 2009 to 24.4
percent in 2013. Note that the value of the relative poverty line increased or stayed fixed between



                                                                        8
2009 and 2013 in real terms between 2009 and 2013, indicating that the fall in relative poverty
points to an improvement in living conditions at the bottom of the distribution (Figure 2).
Poverty measured in absolute terms also decreased between 2009 and 2013. Using per capita
disposable income as the welfare aggregate and the 2011 PPP values of the global extreme poverty
and moderate poverty lines (US$1.9/day and US$3.1/day, respectively) we obtain that absolute
poverty decreased in the period of analysis. Moderate poverty declined by 5.4 percentage points
in 2009-13, from 17.1 percent to 11.7 percent (Figure 3). Extreme poverty also experienced a
consistent decline at a lower proportional rate, decreasing from 9.7 to 6.2 percent. Similar trends
are observed when using a welfare aggregate based on adult equivalent scales.

However, absolute poverty in Macedonia is still higher than in most of the EU countries, even
after controlling for level of economic development. Among the countries with comparable
statistics (EU countries and candidates) Serbia and Romania had similar GDP per capita levels in
2012 (2011 PPP dollars) but reported lower poverty incidence. Moreover, the closest countries
with higher level of GDP per capita report considerably lower levels of poverty (e.g. Bulgaria and

 Box 1: How is Poverty Measured in FYR Macedonia?

 Poverty is officially measured in FYR Macedonia using an income-based welfare aggregate and a
 relative poverty line. This methodology has been in place since 2010, and it is consistent with the
 methodology in EU countries, according to the Europe 2020 strategy. In addition, official poverty

                                                       9
 indicators also report Severe Material Deprivation and Very-Low Work Intensity, two non-monetary
 indicators oriented to capture vulnerability and social exclusion.
 Income-based Welfare Aggregate
 The income aggregate used includes income from market sources and cash benefits. Income from
 market sources includes employee cash or near cash income, cash benefits from self-employment,
 income from rental of a property or land, regular inter-household cash transfer received, interest,
 dividends, profit from capital investments in unincorporated businesses and income received by people
 aged under 16. Cash benefits are a sum of all unemployment benefits, old age and survivor's pensions,
 sickness and disability benefits; education-related, family/children related and housing allowances; and
 benefits for social exclusion or those not elsewhere classified. Direct taxes and regular inter-household
 cash transfers paid are deducted from gross income to obtain disposable income. The current definition
 of total household disposable income used for the calculation of poverty indicators excludes imputed
 rent, value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee
 income except company cars. The income reference period is a fixed 12-month period from the
 previous calendar year.
 To reflect differences in household size and composition, the income figures are given in per
 equivalent adult scale. This means that the total household income is divided by its equivalent size
 using the modified OECD equivalence scale, which gives a weight of 1.0 to the first adult, 0.5 to any
 other household member aged 14 or over and 0.3 to each child below age 14. The resulting figure,
 which is the sum of these weights, is attributed to the household. Thus, for instance, a household that
 consists of 2 adults and 2 children below the age of 14 is therefore: 1.0 + 0.5 + (2*0.3) = 2.1.
 Relative Poverty Line
 Referred to as the at-risk-of-poverty line. This line is defined as the 60 percent of the median national
 equivalised disposable income of the persons living in households.

Progress has also been observed below the poverty line. The poverty gap index (Foster at al.,
1984), which measures the average distance to the poverty line ($3.1/day line), decreased from 7.7
percent of the poverty line in 2009 to 5.1 percent of the poverty line in 2013 (Figure 5). This
indicates that in addition to having fewer poor people in 2013 than in 2009, the poor in 2013 were
on average better off than the poor in 2009. A similar result is obtained when using the extreme
poverty line ($1.9/day line), for whom the poverty gap fell by 1.4 percentage points of the poverty
line. A complementary indicator designed to measure the depth of poverty gives more importance
to households that are furthest from the poverty line, called the poverty severity index, also shows
improvements (Figure 6). The poverty severity index estimates the weighted average distance to
the poverty line, using as weights the distance to the poverty line itself hence giving more
importance to the poorest households. The estimated index fell from 4.8 in 2009 to 3.2 in 2013,
using the $3.1/day, indicating that the depth of poverty has decreased in this period.

Further disaggregation of poverty trends by urban/rural areas and regions is not possible at
this stage of the analysis. Due to lack of availability of geographic identifiers (urban/rural and
region) made available in the SILC microdata, a more detailed analysis by locations or region is
not possible. We therefore restrict our analysis of welfare, poverty and shared prosperity to the
national level. Indicators at the regional level from the 2009 Macedonia Poverty Assessment

                                                    10
indicate, however, that standards of living were higher in 2006 in Skopje than in the rest of the
country, including other cities and rural areas. To the extent that internal migration in the last 10
years had not led to relocation of the poor across the country, this difference is expected to persist.

The declining trend in poverty is a break with the pre-2008 trend, when absolute poverty
was stagnant. Consumption-based poverty indicators between 2003 and 2008 showed a stagnant
trend, increasing slightly in 2008. In contrast, recent years show a clear decreasing trend for the
poverty estimates (Figure 7). While direct comparisons of levels are not possible because of the
use of different welfare aggregates, the divergent patterns can indicate a change in the connection
between growth and poverty. As noted in the 2009 Macedonia Poverty Assessment (World Bank,
2009) in the pre-crisis period economic growth did not lead to declining poverty. Job creation was
not a channel for poverty alleviation as new job creation was primarily in unpaid or low wage
employment and net formal job creation was by firms with negative productivity growth (i.e. low
wage jobs unlikely to be long-lasting). The extent to which this pattern has changed after the crisis
is the analyzed on section 3.

Moreover, growth has been pro-poor in the post-crisis period. Pre-crisis growth particularly
benefitted the top quintile of the welfare distribution, which was particularly hurt during the
slowdown and recession. In contrast, the bottom of the distribution experienced lower than average
growth before the crisis. Contrary to what happened in other Western Balkans countries such as
Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (World Bank 2015d, 2015e, 2016), after the crisis the slowdown
did not hurt relatively more those at the bottom, and the distribution of growth started benefiting
the poor. In the pre-crisis period, growth was positive only for the upper section of the distribution
(Figure 8). In the post-crisis period this patterns reverses, with higher welfare growth for the
bottom of the distribution and a fall in welfare for the top 10 percent of the distribution (Figure 9).

prosperity is measured as the income growth among the bottom 40 percent of the income
distribution. Income growth of the bottom 40 percent was much faster than the income growth for
the total population between 2009 and 2013 (Figure 10). In contrast, in the pre-crisis period, though
average growth was positive, the bottom 40 saw their consumption levels decrease while the top
60 percent of the country did indeed benefit from the growth spell.

Welfare comparisons before and after the crisis should be performed with caution due to the
change of measure from consumption to income. Differences in poverty estimates based on
income and consumption may not reflect actual differences in living standards but the differences
in the measures, so direct comparisons are not advisable. As an illustration, Figure 11 presents
poverty indicators for selected countries based on income and consumption. Among these
countries is Serbia, for which there is poverty based on income for 2012 and based on consumption
for 2013. As shown, there is a considerable decrease from 2012 to 2013, most likely driven by the
change in welfare aggregate rather than by actual improvements in the living conditions at the
bottom of the distribution. Hence, to avoid spurious comparisons we do not compare poverty levels
from different welfare aggregates directly, but instead focus on changes in trends.
Consumption and income trends are comparable to the extent that changes in both measures
reflect changes in households’ welfare. In principle, measures based on income and consumption
should follow similar trends in time as both measures reflect resources available at the household
level. This has actually been observed in Peru 2006-2011 and Poland 2006-2011, where income

                                                                                                               13
and consumption growth trends showed similar patterns (see Appendix D). It may occur, however,
that dynamics differ because of changes in savings or assets accumulation (Meyer and Sullivan,
2009), increases in expenses not typically considered in the consumption aggregates (e.g. durables
or ceremonies), differences on response patterns between income and consumption (including
under-reporting and non-response) or methodological changes in data collection. Discarding
methodological changes (these remained constant, which is actually the foundation for
comparisons within periods), it is possible that the trend reported using income may have not been
completely captured by the consumption aggregate, so contrasts in welfare before and after the
crisis should also be done with some caution. Household income information was also collected
in the HBS but it was considered not fit for analysis due to potential underreporting and a long
recall period (World Bank, 2009).

Inequality trends also reversed in the post-crisis period. Inequality, as measured by the Gini
coefficient, increased during the pre-crisis growth spell (Figure 12), but the trend was reversed
after the crisis. In spite of perceptions of increasing inequality in recent years, from 2009 to 2013
the Gini coefficient decreased from 0.42 to 0.36 (Figure 13). The Theil index also fell consistently
during this period. Inequality measures in the pre-crisis period are based on consumption, while in
the post-crisis are based on income, hence comparison of specific Gini values between periods
should be avoided. Trends, however, are more robust to the change in welfare aggregate and the
comparisons are appropriate. The captured reduction in inequality in 2009-2013 is particularly
striking considering perceptions of the contrary. For instance, qualitative studies in the region have
shown that, in line with what is reported in other countries in the Western Balkans, the vast
majority of people in FYR Macedonia perceived increases in the distance between the rich and the
poor in the last 10 years (Davalos et al, 2016). A possible explanation for reconciling these two
results is to consider that household surveys usually do not capture well the income of the very top

of the income distribution (Hlasny and Verme, 2013; Van Der Weide et al., 2016), so the described
inequality dynamics could be understood as excluding the very top of the distribution.
The decreasing income inequality in the post-crisis period is mostly driven by negative
income growth of those located at the top of the distribution. Improving income inequality
was due more to the losses of upper income earners rather than by gains of lower income earners,
as indicated by a large fall in p90/p50, as well as a moderate increase in the p10/p50 ratio (Figure
14).

The drop in poverty rate was largely the result of a more equitable income distribution.
Changes in income at the bottom and top of the distribution resulted in a more equitable
distribution, which is the main factor behind the poverty reduction observed in 2009-2013. Figure
15 presents the results of a microdecomposition following the Datt-Ravallion method (Datt and
Ravallion, 1992). Results indicate that the most important factor to explain the reduction in poverty
at $3.1/day (2011 PPP) was changes in the shape of the distribution (labelled as Redistribution
component). In contrast, the average level of income increased only minimally and hence growth
of the entire distribution (Growth component) played a limited role in explaining the observed
reduction in poverty.
Poverty is expected to have continued decreasing in 2014 and 2015. While microdata-based
poverty estimates are not available beyond 2013, there are indications that poverty has continued
to decline more recently. Poverty projections based on the assumption that the 2009-2013
relationship between GDP growth and household income remain stable show that poverty should

have continued decreasing (Figure 16). Applying the observed GDP per capita growth in 2014 and
2015 to the household income distribution results in a reduction in poverty between 2013 and 2015
of roughly one percentage point when using the $3.1/day line and 0.7 percentage points when
using the $1.9/day line. Projections for the period 2016-2018 based on World Bank projected GDP
(World Bank, 2016a) growth show a continuation of the decreasing trend, as well.

 Box 2: Income-based and Consumption-based Poverty Indicators: A Contrast

 Measuring poverty requires the use of either income or consumption as welfare aggregate, a proxy for
 household utility level. Choosing either one has some advantages and disadvantages, depending on the
 economic environment of the country.
 A. Income
    - Income can be easily collected when is mostly composed of wages and salaries. It may be
        possible to get adequate information on interest, dividends and income from some type of self-
        employment.
    - It is difficult to collect accurate measures of farm income, the value of housing services and
        capital gains. For instance, the value of animals on a farm or the change in the value of a house
        is not always readily available for collection when an interview is performed.
    - Income tends to be underreported, especially in economies with large agricultural or self-
        employed populations. The reasons may range from people forgetting items sold to reluctance
        to disclose the full extent of income, or reluctance to report income earned illegally.
    - Income measures do not capture how households smooth consumption when facing a negative
        or positive economic shock.
 B. Consumption
    - Consumption can provide a more accurate picture of household wellbeing because households
        are more able, or willing, to recall what they have spent rather than what they earned.
    - Consumption can still be underreported, especially consumption of luxuries or illicit items, or if
        the questions asked are not detailed.




                                                     16
     -   Consumption patterns are informative for policymaking, for example in terms of food
         consumption and caloric intake, energy expenses, expenditure impact of income transfers and
         others.
 Most developed countries base their poverty indicators on income, mainly because it is easier to collect
 than consumption and that given the structure of their economies, figures result in reasonably accurate
 estimates. As FYR Macedonia moves from consumption to income as a measure of welfare, it is
 important to keep in mind characteristics of the FYR Macedonian economy, such as high informality and
 reliance on farming income for poor rural households that can make more complex accurate poverty
 estimations.

3. Drivers of Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity
The break in the poverty reduction pattern after 2009 signals a change in the relationship
between growth and poverty, indicating the need for a deeper analysis of labor income, social
assistance, remittances and other sources of household income. Before 2009, robust economic
growth did not translate into poverty reduction. To understand the channels of transmission of
growth into poverty reduction after 2009 this section presents the performance of labor markets,
social transfers and other factors in 2009-2013 that may have affected household per capita income
and have helped poverty reduction.

Labor income
Employment increased steadily in FYR Macedonia in 2003-2013, in spite of the slowdown in
economic growth after the financial crisis. Overall employment increased at 2.2 annual growth
rate in the 2003-2008 period and 1.6 annual growth rate in 2009-2013 (World Development
Indicators). This has translated into a substantial increase in the employment-to-population rate.
While in 2003, only 34 percent of the working-age individuals were employed in Macedonia, this
ratio climbed to 40 percent in 2013 (Figure 17). Despite the improved employment performance,
this ratio is still very low compared to other countries in the region, about 15 percentage point
lower than the world average and more than 10 percentage points below the Europe and Central
Asia region (Figure 18; Mojsoska-Blazevski and Kurtishi, 2012). While there may exists some
concerns about what is exactly captured as employment in the LFS, the original source of
information for the World Development Indicators, (World Bank, 2014; Jovanovic, 2015) the LFS
is the internationally accepted tool for measuring unemployment and its data collection
methodology has remained constant during the period, making it very unlikely to report a spurious
trend. Moreover, the increase in employment is also captured by the SILC, which relies on an
entirely different nationally representative survey.
The continuous expansion in employment has translated into a sharp decline in the
unemployment rate. Before the financial crisis, rising employment was accompanied by increases
in labor force participation, but still the net effect was a reduction of the unemployment rate. After
the financial crisis labor force participation has stabilized at around 55 percent (Figure 19), which
together with the slow demographic growth translated into the labor force growing at a slow pace
between 2009 and 2013 (0.6 annually). The employment annual growth rate of 1.6 after the crisis


                                                   17
meant that most of the employment increases translated directly into unemployment reduction
(Figure 20).

Overall, construction has surpassed services as the main sectorial driver of growth after the
crisis. In the period preceding the global financial crisis, services was the main contributor to GDP
growth, growing on average 5.7 percent between 2003 and 2008 and contributing about 75 percent
of overall growth. Since the crisis, growth in the services sector has slowed down and industry has
taken over as the most important sector (Figure 21). The increasing importance of industry is
explained in part by the role of construction, as the government has pursued since 2009 a more
active and countercyclical investment program concentrated in the energy sector and construction.
Construction has grown 14 percent annually on average between 2009 and 2013, contributing to
60 percent of overall value added growth (Figure 22). The contribution of the agricultural sector
was negative after the financial crisis.

Services continues to be the most important sector for employment creation, despite the
increased importance of construction for driving output growth after the crisis. Data from
the Labor Force Survey (LFS) indicates that in the post crisis period, services has overall
contributed to close to 43 percent of overall employment growth (Figure 23). Within services,
education, transportation and storage are the major contributors to net employment creation,
representing close to 7 and 10 percent, respectively, of employment creation. Agriculture,
manufacturing and construction also had significant contributions to employment creation after
the financial crisis, representing jointly half of all the new positions created. Net job creation after
the financial crisis has concentrated more among sectors characterized by low productivity and
low wages, benefitting potentially more those at the bottom of the income distribution (Figure 24).
This represents a contrast with the pre-crisis period, where new jobs created were mostly unpaid
jobs for low or unskilled youth, not contributing to poverty reduction (World Bank 2009, 2014).

The active role of the public sector in job creation raises concerns about the sustainablity of
the employment gains on account of the limited fiscal space to continue supporting
employment creation and further investments in infrastructure. While raw statistics show that
the public sector employment share, as captured by the LFS, has decreased from 26.4 percent in
2009 to 23.2 percent in 2013, the government has played an important role in employment
expansion. The expansion in construction in the post-crisis period coincides with the launching of
large-scale public construction projects which, though reported as private employment, is
ultimately driven by fiscal spending. In addition, new employment in the core public sector with
budgetary implications (public administration, health, education, water supply) adds up to more
than 20 percent of the net total employment growth in 2009-2013. Finally, active labor market
policies (ALMP) implemented by the government may have also played a role in the expansion of
the employment. Based on information from the Macedonia Employment Agency, close to 3,000
unemployed workers per year received some form of training or subsidy to work. While it may be
difficult to track to what extent these workers became permanently employed as a consequence of
the training and there is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of these programs (Mojsoska-
Blazevski and Petreski, 2015), it provides an upper bound of the effect of government spending in

                                                                              20
ALMP on employment. The total number of ALMP beneficiaries between 2009 and 2013 was
14,631 workers, which would represent 30 percent of total net employment creation in the period.
Hence, considering altogether these effects, the impact of government on employment creation is
between a third (construction and core public sector employment) and half (adding ALMP
beneficiaries) of new employment.

The financial crisis did affect labor markets through productivity losses. Labor productivity
slowed down after the crisis, which translated into a decrease in average real wages after 2009.
Average labor productivity growth, measured as GDP per worker, dropped substantially after the
crisis, from 2.4 to 0.4 percent - well below the historical average. The weak productivity growth
has mirrored the weak growth in real GDP per capita. With only marginal productivity increases,
firms were not able to afford wage increases. Between 2009 and 2013 salaries decreased by 1.9
percent annually on average (Figure 25), according to information collected from business
enterprise surveys (BES) by the Macedonia SSO. This decrease in average salaries is also
consistent with new workers taking positions below the existing average salary in each sector. The
information on wages refers to formal workers and excludes self-employed and agricultural
workers. Unfortunately is not possible to validate this trend with SILC data because of limited
access to microdata and how the data is collected in the SILC questionnaire.

Across sectors, the real wage decrease was more pronounced in services. In this sector, average
salaries fell by 1.79 percent annually. Average salaries in industry fell by 1.14 percent annually,
while average salaries in agriculture stayed roughly at the same level between 2010 and 2013
(Figure 26). Average salaries capture well the average earnings of workers in the services and
industry sectors, to the extent that more than 90 percent of workers in these sectors are salaried. In
agriculture, in contrast, the vast majority of workers are either self-employed (46 percent) or
unpaid family workers (44 percent). To gain some insight in the earnings dynamics of these
                                                                             21
workers, we consulted value added information for the agricultural sector. Though a very rough
measure for incomes in the sector, value added per worker employed in the sector should at least
capture the direction of the earnings trend. Value added per worker for the agricultural actually
decreased between 2009 and 2013, by more than 7 percent annually, on average, in real terms.
This indicates that earnings among self-employed workers in the agricultural sector have most
likely decreased, too. Inflation during this period was contained, roughly 3 percent annually, hence
unlikely to be the main driver behind the fall in real terms.

The net effect on the bottom of the distribution of the increase in employment and fall in
salaries has been an increase in labor earnings. Labor earnings include cash wages and earnings
of self-employed. Employment growth created relative more economic opportunities among the
poor, even though their employment outcomes still lag considerably behind the rest. For the poor
below the $1.9/day and $3.1 and for the bottom 40 the employment rate increased more than
proportionally than for the rest of the population (Figure 27). The increase in employment
translated into increases in labor earnings among the bottom. The poor (below the $3.1 per day
line) and the bottom 40 have seen their labor income increase (Figure 28). This result is also
consistent with the existence of a composition effect to explain falling average salaries, where new
workers entered the labor force with wages below the average in their sectors.

In contrast, the top of the distribution have seen their labor earnings fall. Although the non-
poor also report increases on their employment rates (Figure 27), there is some heterogeneity
within this group. Employment rates by level of education show that for the most educated, most
likely located at the top of the income distribution, employment rates have actually fallen between
2009 and 2013 (Figure 29). This may be one of the forces behind the net labor income reduction
among the non-poor.

The increase in labor incomes at the bottom has contributed to lifting people out of poverty
since labor earnings continue to be a primary source of income for the poor. Labor tend to be
the most abundant asset of the poor, and labor force status is repeatedly found to be a critical

determinant of household welfare in developing countries and what generally distinguishes the
poor from the non-poor is labor income (Figure 30).

Social Assistance

The Social Financial Assistance (SFA) and Children Allowance programs have had only a
limited role for increasing incomes in 2009-2013. Social assistance spending in Macedonia is
low and fragmented. Social transfer programs include a last-resort social assistance program
(SFA), as well as other benefits such as child allowances, parental and disability benefits. The
SILC reports them in two categories, as Children/Social, which includes Children Allowance and
SFA and other benefits, including survivor, sickness, disability benefits and education allowances.
The effect of the first of these components is positive to lift the incomes of the bottom and second
quintile, though their magnitude is very small (Figure 31). This can be explained by the transfer
remaining constant during this time and the low coverage of the programs. Only 8 percent of
households in the country receive SFA and roughly 10 percent receive Children Allowance.

Other social benefits have had a negative effect over incomes across the whole distribution
and the magnitude has been larger in the upper deciles. The other social benefits category
captures survivor, sickness, disability benefits and education allowances. Their negative effect on
household income could be capturing the introduction of the Cash Benefits Management
Information System (CBMIS) in late 2011, a centralized database that registers all cash transfer
beneficiaries. Since its introduction, the number of social assistance recipients has declined, as
possibilities for abuse of the system were considerably curtailed (Figure 32). The larger impact in
the top quintile is a positive signal of the improved targeting system introduced by the CBMIS
(World Bank, 2015a).

Pensions contributed significantly to income growth among the top three quintiles of the
distribution. Between 2009 and 2013, income from pension for those in the top 60 percent of the
distribution increased at an average annual rate of 7 percent, compared to only 1.3 percent among
those in the bottom 40. These increases are related to the decision of the government of Macedonia,
in spite of a firm indexation rule, to increase pensions in 2013, 2014 and 2015 as a compensatory
measure for the impact of the 2009 recession. In 2013, the pension benefits were raised by an
average of 5 percentage points above regular indexation, which at that year stood at 2 percent
(indexation is based on 50% average gross wage growth plus 50% CPI (World Bank, 2015a). Since
income from pensions for the two lowest quintiles increased only marginally in this period, it did
not play a role in the reduction of absolute poverty (Figure 31).

Although pensions played a minimal role for income growth at the bottom of the distribution,
pensions still represent a significant share of household income among the bottom 40. The
minimal role played by pensions to explain the increase in income in 2009-2013, especially among
the bottom, does not mean that pensions do not play an important role to complement household
income. Pensions represent close to 13 percent of disposable income for the bottom 40, which
means that poverty would increase considerably if pensions were subtracted from disposable
                                                24
income. As an illustration, in 2013 relative poverty would increase from 22.1 to 24.8 if social
assistance were subtracted, and up to 41.7 if pensions were additionally subtracted (Macedonia
State Statistical Office, 2015). This difference indicates the critical role of pensions to complement
income around the value of the relative poverty line. Indeed, this may be one of the reasons why
the share of people over 65 years old is lower among the poor (5 percent) and bottom 40 (8 percent)
than among the rest (13 and 14 percent for the non-poor and top 60, respectively).

Other Income

Other sources of income have contributed negatively to income dynamics in the lowest
quintile. Other sources capture income from remittances, underage income, capital, and housing
allowance. Remittances, while important in other countries in the region, represents only 4 percent
of GDP (Figure 33) and a small fraction of household income in Macedonia (unofficial estimates
of remittances, though, can situate this number as high as 17 percent). The value of household
transfers captured by the SILC represented only 1.9 percent of income in 2009 and 1.4 percent in
2013, with higher shares at the bottom of the distribution. Other surveys in the country specifically
designed to measure remittances obtain values between 2 and 5 times higher (Petreski and
Jovanovic, 2016), meaning that remittances could actually represent a larger share of household
income (somewhere between 5 and 6.5 percent). Based on SILC data, however, remittances are
only a small share and decreased in real terms for all quintiles between 2009 and 2013, with the
only exception of the second quintile. The small share that remittances represent means that they
played a limited role to explain total income dynamics, with the exception of the lowest quintile,
where the fall in remittances translated into a decrease in the share of income from 9 to 3 percent

                                                                               25
of total income. Petreski and Jovanovic (2016) identify an impact of remittances on poverty
reduction but this estimation is based a counterfactual where households do not receive any
remittances. Hence, this result shows the role of remittances for lifting households out of poverty
at one point in time but does not addresses whether changes in the value of remittances in time is
translating into households escaping poverty, as is presented in this note. Other sources of income
(underage income, capital, and housing allowance) represent jointly less than one percent of
household income and play a very minor role in household income dynamics.

Outflows

Changes in taxation can explain the positive impact that households’ outflows had on income
at the top of the distribution. Outflows captured in the SILC include regular taxes on wealth,
regular inter-household cash transfer paid, and taxes on income and social insurance contributions.
Among these categories, taxes and contributions were reduced in the after crisis period. Personal
income tax was lowered from 12 to 10 percent in 2009. In addition, government reduced
contribution rates in order to cut labor costs and improve labor competitiveness. Social security
contributions (health, pensions and unemployment) were reduced from 32.5 percent in 2008 to 27
percent in 2011 (See Appendix C). The joint effect of these reductions may explain the positive
effect of outflows at the top of the income distribution, where more likely formal well-paid
employment is located (Figure 31).

The negative effect of households’ outflows at the bottom of the distribution may be driven
by the effect of increased employment. As employment rates increased at the bottom of the
distribution, contributions and taxes passed from zero to positive, hence increasing for the bottom
and explaining the observed negative effect (Figure 31).

Poverty projections

The performance of labor markets and social protection indicators in 2014 and 2015
supports the projected declining trend in poverty. Employment continued to increase in 2014
and 2015 for most educational levels, including Higher vocational and University, which declined
between 2009 and 2013. The only worrisome exceptions are employment for the groups with no
education and the higher vocational education, though each of them only represents 2 percent of
total employment, respectively (Appendix, Table A1). Real salaries have also increased from 2013
to 2015, benefiting from the price deflation in 2014. Salaries in agriculture have grown by one
percentage point annually, and in services and industry by roughly 3 percent annually (Appendix,
Table A2). The implementation of the government program for the 2014-2018 period, which
included increases in pensions and social benefits, should have a positive impact on household
income (World Bank, 2015a).

 Box 3: Using the 2002 Census as sampling frame

 The Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) and the Labor Force Survey (LFS) used for the
 analysis of labor markets use the 2002 Census as sampling frame. To the extent that the composition of
 the population may have changed since the 2002 Census (particularly due to outmigration), the use of
 this sampling frame may lead to estimates that are not entirely representative of the country in recent
 years. However, there are reasons to believe that the impact using the 2002 Census as sampling frame
 is minimal. First, the SSO has been progressively updating the sampling frame in recent years,
 consistent with United Nations Statistics Division recommendations for cases when a more recent
 census is not available (United Nations, 2005). Second, the typical profile of out-migrants, young
 single professionals, is different from that of the poor in Macedonia, reducing the possibilities of
 miscounting the poor. Finally, contrasts with other nationally representative sources of information, as
 for instance business enterprises surveys, show general consistent results.

 Nevertheless, it is still of critical importance to conduct a new population census. Among other things,
 these new estimates will provide an accurate estimate of outmigration (which is otherwise very difficult
 to estimate) and will permit to update the sampling frame, ultimately dissipating doubts about the
 representativeness of recent household surveys.



4. Changes in Characteristics of the Poor and Bottom 40
Sociodemographic characteristics

The poor tend to live in larger households than the non-poor, but the difference in household
size among poor and non-poor is shrinking over time. In fact, while in 2009 about 76.5 percent
of poor households tend to live in households with more than 4 people, in 2013 this was reduced
to 65.9 percent (Appendix, Table B9 and B10).

Less well-off households have a higher share of children 0-14 years old and a lower share of
elderly (over 65 years old) than the non-poor households, and these shares are relatively
constant over time. While the more affluent groups have a share of children among household
members of about 10-11 percent, for the poor and bottom 40 this share goes up to around 20
percent. The higher share of children together with the higher household size points to a higher
burden on the working age adults at home responsible for providing for their families.

Poor households and those at the bottom 40 percent are significantly more likely to live in
smaller and more crowded houses, but their housing conditions seem to be improving over
time. Considering that poor and bottom 40 households tend to have more members, and live in
smaller dwellings, the higher reported overcrowding in these groups is not surprising. Using the
household members per room as a metric for overcrowding, we obtain the share of households
with more than two people per room was more than three times in the bottom 40 percent compared
to the top 60 percent in 2009 (21 vs. 8 percent), and a similar pattern repeated along the poverty
status (17 vs. 4 percent). In 2013, the share of poor households living with more than 2 people per


                                                   27
room decreased by a few percentage points; only 16 percent of the poor and 15 of the bottom 40
lived in overcrowded houses.

Some characteristics of the household heads may be closely related to poverty, such as
gender, age, marital status, and educational levels. Differences in the gender and age of
household heads are small between poor and non-poor households. In 2009, all households are
much more likely to be headed by a male than a female, but this is less common among the non-
poor and the top 60. For instance, for the top 60 the share of households headed by males in 2009
was 78.7%, while for less affluent bottom 40 this share was 87.5% in 2013. Along the poverty
status division the gap is similar in magnitude, although slightly smaller. Similarly, across all the
groups considered, household heads tend to be older as more than two thirds of households across
groups are headed by someone 45 years old or older. Results are similar for 2013.

Household heads living in poor households have lower education attainment than their non-
poor counterparts. In 2009, a much higher fraction of poor household heads have completed
primary education, while the non-poor heads are more likely to have completed secondary and
tertiary education. These results point to the fact that the set of human capital assets that poor and
bottom 40 families have to improve their living conditions are limited. Even before entering to
compete in the labor market, they start with a clear disadvantage for their income earning
prospects, particularly given the high rates of return to tertiary education prevalent in FYR
Macedonia (Arias et al., 2014).

Labor market attachment is significantly weaker among the less well-off, but is improving
over time. In both years, the poor and bottom 40 households are less likely to have individuals
currently working, either as employed or self-employed. The gap, though, is considerably higher
for wage employment, which is consistent with the low levels of accumulated human capital.
Unemployment and inactivity, particularly the former, are much more prevalent among the poor
and bottom 40 percent. The share of retirees is lower among the poor and bottom 40 households,
consistent with the lower levels of employment and lower levels of wage employment among these
groups. However, the average poor person in 2013 is much more likely to be employed and less
likely to be unemployed than the average poor person in 2009.

Income generation capacity

A household’s income generation capacity is determined by its net assets, the intensity of use
of these assets, the returns on the assets, and private and public transfers. In order to enhance
our understanding of growth incidence and the ability of households at the bottom to generate
income and contribute productively to overall growth, we use an asset-based approach, as in
Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014).

Gaps between poor and non-poor human capital endowments are especially large when
looking at them from an income generation perspective. On average, individuals living in poor
households have two years of schooling less than individuals living in non-poor households (Table

                                                 28
1). This gap is of similar size when looking at bottom 40 and top 60 households. These differences
in the means of the distribution are explained by a much larger share of relatively unskilled
population living in extremely poor households. In 2009 while 14.4 percent of the population in
non-poor households have completed tertiary education, this share was only 3 percent among poor
households (Table 2).

Poor households also use their human capital less intensively than non-poor households, but
their intensity of use is improving over time. Even though labor force participation rates are not
significantly different between poor and non-poor, when individuals living in poor households
participate in the labor market, they are more likely to be unemployed or employed in informal-
sector jobs. The estimated labor force participation rate for all groups is close to 60 percent. There

                                                  29
are statistically significant differences in unemployment rates between individuals living in poor
and non-poor households. In 2009, the unemployment rate among individuals living in poor
households (82 percent) is significantly higher than among non-poor households (31 percent).
When poor individuals are employed, about 61.5 percent of them are employed in the informal-
sector, compared to 26.6 percent among individuals living in non-poor households. As mentioned
before, there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate among the poor over time and a
higher employment-population ratio, which for a relatively constant labor force participation
means a higher intensity of use of their human capital.

There is a significant wage gap between poor and non-poor individuals but the gap is
shrinking over time. While in 2009 the average household per capita wages among the non-poor

                                                 30
was 18.6 times the average wage of their poor counterparts, this was only 14.8 times in 2013.
Average household per capita wages of those living in extreme poverty are strikingly low, a fact
that is consistent with the low human capital endowments that these households possess, the high
unemployment rates among its household’s members, the low quality jobs that this population has
access to (informal), and the low market returns for each additional year of schooling driven by
low productivity. These differences may also be related to occupational and sectoral choices, since
a significantly high share of individuals living in poor households work in the agricultural sector,
usually characterized by having much lower labor productivity than other sectors. Such gaps are
also stark when bottom 40 and top-60 households are compared.

5. Challenges Ahead
Despite considerable reduction in poverty over the last few years, approximately 241,000
people in Macedonia still live in poverty and 127,000 live in extreme poverty. As shown, by
2013 income poverty and extreme poverty rates (based on U$3.1 and U$ 1.9 per day, 2011 PPP)
in the country were 11.7 percent and 6.2 percent, above the average poverty headcount rates of the
EU SILC countries region. These rates are higher than for countries with similar level of GDP per
capita.

The sluggish performance of labor markets in Macedonia is an obstacle for sustained
inclusive growth. Jobs are shown to be a crucial mechanism to accelerate growth and to translate
growth into shared prosperity and poverty reduction. Despite recent improvements, FYR
Macedonia faces three key challenges to promote shared prosperity into the future: low
employment-population ratios, high inactivity and persistently high levels of long-run
unemployment even when compared to other Western Balkans countries. Only 36 out of 100
working-age individuals is employed in Macedonia, compared to 50 in the whole ECA region, 59
in Latin America and 57 in OECD countries. This is primarily explained by low labor force
participation rates and high levels of long-run unemployment. These levels of unemployment and
inactivity are also significantly higher than in other countries with similar income levels.

Income-generation opportunities for the poor are limited. The poor have very weak labor
market attachment, hindering opportunities for future growth, inclusion, and poverty reduction.
Despite recent improvements, employment and unemployment are much worse for the poor and
the bottom 40 than for the rest. In 2013, employment rates were only 7 and 14 percent for the
extreme poor and poor (Figure 27). For the bottom 40 employment rate was higher (28 percent),
but still considerably behind the national rate (40 percent) or the top 60 (47 percent).
Unemployment rates depict a similar picture, with very large unemployment rates for the less well
off (Figure 34). Bringing those at the bottom of the distribution back to work is key to both
economic growth and inclusion.

Employment quality for the less well-off is also lower than for the rest of the country. Poor
and bottom 40 workers are more likely to be in the informal sector of the economy, which typically


                                                31
means lower salaries and protection (Figure 35). The share of workers in the informal sector among
the ones below the extreme poverty line ($1.9/day) is 54 percent, and is even higher for those
below the $3.1/line (62 percent). In both cases this is much higher than what is reported for the
non-poor (close to one third).

                                                         in companies with 5 or less workers.


The employed poor are more likely to be employed in low productivity sectors. A higher
fraction of the poor is employed in traditionally low productivity or low wage sectors. Agriculture,
composed mostly by self-employed or unpaid family workers cultivating their own land,
represented 43 percent of employment among the poor in 2013, more than double the national
share of employment for the sector (19 percent). This result indicates, as well, that the poor are
over represented in rural areas. The other important sectors among the poor are manufacturing,
trade, hotel and food services, and construction, sectors that rank among the lowest in terms of
average salary (Figure 36).

The poor rely in government transfers to complement their income. In spite of the weak labor
market attachment of the poor, labor income still represents close to the two thirds of their income
in 2013, up from close to half in 2009 (Figure 37). The rest comes largely from social transfers
(Children and Social Allowance, Other benefits and Pensions) and to a lesser extent from
unemployment benefits and other sources of income like inter-household transfers. The
importance of social transfers to complement the income of the less well-off is more a reflection

of the low levels of labor income for this group than the generosity of the transfers system. For
instance, in 2013 the poor earned on average only one tenth of the non-poor in the labor markets.

Inclusive growth seem also to be challenged by the differences through the population
subgroups in access to jobs, and in particular, to high productivity and high wages jobs.
When looking across genders, the unemployment rate is not significantly higher among females
than males in Macedonia. In fact, in 2014 the unemployment rate among females was higher than
males by only 1 percentage points. This is low when compared to other countries in the Western
Balkans. However, female labor force participation is considerably lower for women than for men;
the second highest gap among Western Balkans countries (Figure 38: Labor force participation by
gender, Western Balkans countries, 2013 (Percentage of population 15-64)Figure 38), and, as
noted by World Bank (2015b), these differences become even larger when adding the ethnicity
dimension (Albanian, Roma, Turkish). Opportunities of employment for the youth are limited.
More than half of the youth willing to work are unable to find a job (Figure 39).

Demographics seem important looking forward, since they will shape future labor markets
performance. The window of opportunity to grow based on the demographic dividend seems to
be short, in particular for a country like Macedonia with medium-term aging. As other countries
in the region, Macedonia does not have a youth bulge anymore, and they are relatively poorer than
other countries (in terms of GDP per capita) given its median age (Table 3).

Some estimates for the Western Balkans suggest that aging and stagnant populations will
lead to doubling of dependency of the old on the working age from 2015 to 2050. As
populations age, the support burden placed on families and governments will increase relative to
GDP, a matter of great concern in many countries Figure 40: Old age dependency ratio
(population 65+ over population 15-64)(Figure 40). By the time many countries in the region
have exhausted their demographic dividend they will remain at relatively low incomes (Figure
41).

6. Conclusions
This note reports and analyzes the changes in poverty in the 2009-2013 period. It takes
advantage of microdata made recently available by the Macedonia State Statistical Office.
Results show that FYR Macedonia has experienced a steady decline in poverty in the post-
crisis period (2009-2013) in spite of the economic growth slowdown. In contrast to the pre-
crisis period when growth was robust but poverty stagnant, poverty indicators for the most recent
period indicate an improvement on the living conditions of the bottom of the distribution. The drop
in poverty rate was largely the result of a more equitable income distribution rather than growth of
the entire distribution.

Employment gains and labor incomes were the main reason for the increase in welfare
among the well-off after the crisis. Despite the recent gains, labor income levels at the bottom of
the distribution continue to be very low. Among the top deciles, household income has decreased,
on account of a reduction in employment. Social protection and remittances play a very limited
role to explain the reduction in poverty in the period.
The active role of the public sector in job creation raises concerns about the sustainablity of
the employment gains on account of the limited fiscal space to continue expanding spending.
The launching of large-scale public construction projects, expansion of employment in the core
public sector and ALMPs implemented by the government have played a critical role in the
expansion of employment. The impact of government spending is estimated between a third and
half of net employment creation. These measures have contributed to significant fiscal pressures
and raise concerns about the sustainability of this employment growth and the derived welfare
gains.



                                                                 35
FYR Macedonia faces many challenges looking forward. Despite the recent improvements,
poverty and inequality is still high when compared with other countries in the Western Balkans.
Low productivity growth is setting a bound for future wage increases. Income-generation
opportunities for the poor are limited as the poor have very weak labor market attachment, their
employment quality is lower than for the rest and are more likely to be employed in low
productivity sectors. Inclusive growth seem also to be challenged by the differences in access to
high wages jobs for women and the youth. Demographics seem important looking forward, since
they will shape future labor markets performance.
