“Shaping the Food System to Deliver Jobs” is the fourth paper in a series. The first, “Ending
Poverty and Hunger by 2030: An Agenda for the Global Food System,” outlined the overall
agenda and was released at the 2015 Spring Meetings of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund. That paper called for action on climate-smart agriculture, improving nu-
tritional outcomes, strengthening value chains, and creating jobs, while improving market
access for poor farmers. The second, “Shaping a Climate-Smart Global Food System,” fo-
cused on climate-smart agriculture and was distributed at the 2015 Annual Meetings. The
third, “Shaping the Global Food System to Deliver Improved Nutrition and Health,” focused
on improving nutritional outcomes and was distributed at the 2016 Spring Meetings. This
paper focuses on how the food system can deliver jobs. It presents a set of action areas that
countries can adopt, adapt, and apply to their circumstances (tables 1 and 2).

Key messages:
•	 The food system employs the most people in many developing countries in both self and
   wage employment, and will continue to do so during the time period set to achieve the
   Sustainable Development Goals, and thereafter. Self and wage employment in farming
   still generates a large share of rural incomes and can have large poverty-reducing effects.
   Farm labor productivity on a per-hour-worked basis, and accounting for differences in
   human capital, is not necessarily lower than other sectors.
•	 The food system extends beyond farm production to include activities along value chains,
   such as food processing, transportation, retailing, restaurants, and other services. In many
   countries, the off-farm aspect of the food system accounts for a large share of the economy’s
   manufacturing and services sectors. While the employment share in farming tends to decline
   as per capita incomes rise, the share in food manufacturing and services tends to increase.
•	 Increasing the number and inclusiveness of jobs will require attention to food system
   growth, employment intensity, and inclusion of youth and women. Urbanization and per
   capita income growth offers significant new opportunities in non-cereal products and
   in new jobs in the food system beyond the farm. Inclusion of women and the growing
   number of youth into food system jobs can raise productivity and improve social harmony.
•	 Improving the quality of jobs in the food system requires attention to raising returns to
   labor, increasing stability in earnings, and improving working conditions.
•	 Priorities vary by country context. Different combinations of interventions will be needed
   in agriculture-dependent economies relative to transforming or urbanized economies; in
   lagging relative to leading regions; in land abundant relative to land scarce environments;
   whether “pull” or “push” factors are leading to movement of people out of farming in par-
   ticular areas; and on the initial nature of skills deficits.
The four sections of this paper focus on, respectively, why the food system is important for jobs;
how the food system can provide more jobs; what can be done to improve the quality of jobs;
and implementation considerations.

BOX 1: As Per Capita Incomes Increase, More Food System Jobs Will Be in Services and Manufac-
turing, and Many Will Be in Rural Areas

  In low-income countries, the food system tends to dominate total employment in both rural and urban areas. For
  example, the findings of a recent review of six Eastern and Southern African countries shows that the food system
  accounts for more than 80 percent of all jobs. Within the food system, over 90 percent of jobs are in farming
  (including self and wage labor), and most non-farm jobs in the food system are in food services (transportation and
  marketing), accounting for 6 percent of food system jobs, which is double those in food manufacturing/industry.
  These shares are a reflection of dominance of staple grains in production and consumption in these countries. In
  addition, about 75 percent of food manufacturing jobs and 60 percent of food services jobs are in rural areas.
  In middle-income countries, within the food system, farming accounts for closer to half of the jobs, with off-farm jobs
  in food manufacturing and services accounting for the other half. There is also a more even share of jobs in each food
  manufacturing and food services (for example, about 25 percent each, in the case of Brazil). There is a large variation
  across countries. For example, in countries where the share of primary agricultural commodity exports is large (such
  as in Argentina), the food services share (inclusive of logistics [transportation and ports]) is likely a larger share.
  In high-income countries, within the food system, farming accounts for a smaller share of jobs, while food services
  accounts for most jobs. For example, in the US, farming accounts for about 20 percent over overall food system
  jobs, food manufacturing accounts for 14 percent of jobs, while food services accounts for about two-thirds of jobs
  in the food system. Part of the contribution is restaurant services, as half of household income spent on food is on
  consumption away from the home.
