   Box O.1: Summary of three case studies of citizen engagement

   Afghanistan

   Founded in 2005, Integrity Watch Afghanistan (IWA) conducts community-based monitoring programs in several sectors aimed at increasing transparency,
   accountability, and integrity in Afghanistan. In July 2014, IWA launched the Community-Based Monitoring School (CBM-S) program, which seeks to (1)
   improve the quality of education in Afghanistan; (2) increase contact and coordination between communities and officials by bringing together stakehold-
   ers in the education of Afghan children; (3) increase the responsiveness of school officials to citizens; (4) encourage communities to take the initiative in
   addressing education-related problems in their locales; and (5) use the results of community-based monitoring in policy advocacy at the local and national
   levels.

   Paraguay

   ReAcción Paraguay is a registered youth anticorruption organization that was first launched in 2010 as an informal anticorruption group composed of
   young people in Ciudad del Este, the second largest city in Paraguay. Its mission is to empower citizens to prevent corruption and improve the provision
   of public services, particularly public education. The group works primarily to monitor the sovereign wealth fund expenditures allocated to education in
   Paraguay and increase transparency and citizen engagement to ensure that these funds reach their intended targets.

   Serbia

   Serbia on the Move (SoM) seeks to reduce corruption in Serbia’s health sector by strengthening prevention mechanisms, transparency, and accountability
   through citizen engagement. The organization was founded by a group of young professionals and officially launched as a registered association in July
   2009. Its objectives are to (1) raise citizens’ awareness about how to fight corruption in publicly funded health care; (2) formulate new transparency and
   accountability mechanisms to reduce corruption in health care; (3) build the capacity of citizens to actively push for the adoption and implementation of
   these new transparency and accountability mechanisms; and (4) build a coalition of stakeholders (citizens, civil society organizations, state institutions,
   public health practitioners) interested in reducing corruption in the health sector. Serbia on the Move has carried out five projects targeting corruption in
   publicly funded health care, working with health care practitioners, regular citizens, and elites to improve integrity.

governmental organizations (World Bank 2017b, 257).

       Afghanistan

       Founded in 2005, Integrity Watch Afghanistan (IWA) conducts community-based monitoring programs in several sectors aimed at increasing transparency,
       accountability, and integrity in Afghanistan. In July 2014, IWA launched the Community-Based Monitoring School (CBM-S) program, which seeks to (1)
       improve the quality of education in Afghanistan; (2) increase contact and coordination between communities and officials by bringing together stakehold-
       ers in the education of Afghan children; (3) increase the responsiveness of school officials to citizens; (4) encourage communities to take the initiative in
       addressing education-related problems in their locales; and (5) use the results of community-based monitoring in policy advocacy at the local and national
       levels.

       Paraguay

       ReAcción Paraguay is a registered youth anticorruption organization that was first launched in 2010 as an informal anticorruption group composed of
       young people in Ciudad del Este, the second largest city in Paraguay. Its mission is to empower citizens to prevent corruption and improve the provision
       of public services, particularly public education. The group works primarily to monitor the sovereign wealth fund expenditures allocated to education in
       Paraguay and increase transparency and citizen engagement to ensure that these funds reach their intended targets.

       Serbia

       Serbia on the Move (SoM) seeks to reduce corruption in Serbia’s health sector by strengthening prevention mechanisms, transparency, and accountability
       through citizen engagement. The organization was founded by a group of young professionals and officially launched as a registered association in July
       2009. Its objectives are to (1) raise citizens’ awareness about how to fight corruption in publicly funded health care; (2) formulate new transparency and
       accountability mechanisms to reduce corruption in health care; (3) build the capacity of citizens to actively push for the adoption and implementation of
       these new transparency and accountability mechanisms; and (4) build a coalition of stakeholders (citizens, civil society organizations, state institutions,
       public health practitioners) interested in reducing corruption in the health sector. Serbia on the Move has carried out five projects targeting corruption in
       publicly funded health care, working with health care practitioners, regular citizens, and elites to improve integrity.

  Box 2.1: Terms related to citizen engagement

  Terms related to citizen engagement and citizen participation have proliferated in recent years, but they do not necessarily share common definitions. For
  purposes of clarity, we present the following definitions, and in some instances their limitations.

  Voice is the capacity of citizens to express their preferences to state actors through formal or informal channels and to be heard by them (GSDRC 2014, 4).
  Voice can also target nonstate actors or both sets of actors at the same time. Voice is about harnessing and exercising power derived from the grassroots.
  The World Development Report 2017 recognizes the importance of voice by incorporating power analysis and examining citizens as drivers of change in its
  framework.

  Citizen participation encompasses the wide range of bottom-up activities. At one end are circumscribed feedback mechanisms such as citizen report
  cards or community scorecards assessing public services and state activities. Further along the spectrum are participatory budgeting and planning, and
  monitoring of budgets, spending, institutions, services, and social programs. At the other end are organized grassroots campaigns and social movements.

  Citizen engagement, often used interchangeably with citizen participation, is the term used principally in this report. For World Bank purposes, it is a
  “two-way interaction between citizens and governments or the private sector within the scope of WBG [World Bank Group] interventions—policy dialogue,
  programs, projects, and advisory services and analytics—that gives citizens a stake in decision-making with the objective of improving the intermediate and
  final development outcomes of the intervention” (Manroth et al. 2014, 8). Ideally, this interaction underscores power and information sharing, as well as
  mutual respect between officials and citizens, rather than merely inviting highly structured input from citizens on programs, policies, or other matters, with
  limited opportunities for the public to participate in designing these programs (Sheedy 2008).

  Civic engagement is when “ordinary citizens, civil society organizations, or both participate directly or indirectly in exacting accountability” (Grandvoin-
  net, Aslam, and Raha 2015, 1). What is generally implied is that a certain degree of organization and mobilization on the side of the citizens is involved,
  and that typically pressure is exerted on the state (as well as nonstate entities) to comply with its duties and responsibilities.

  Social accountability is a fuzzy concept with no generally accepted definition about the range of actions that fall within its domain, which has been
  defined as “the extent and capability of citizens to hold the state accountable and make it responsive to their needs” (World Bank 2012).

  Social movements refers to citizen mobilization clusters that use collective action, have change-oriented demands and goals, are sustained over time,
  and involve some degree of unity building and organizing. Such movements can use a variety of tactics, including extrainstitutional tactics that are some-
  times combined with institutional measures (Stephan, Lakhani, and Naviwala 2015). Social movements can involve multiple campaigns.

  Civic campaigns are a form of citizen mobilization consisting of “highly energized, intensely focused, concentrated streams of activity with specific goals
  and deadlines” (Ganz 2013, 44).

       Box 2.2: Human rights and citizen engagement

       Basic human rights are laid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and codified into international law through nine core instruments, among
       them the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Citizen engagement is related to the following rights:

           Freedom of expression and right to information (ICCPR, Article 19)
           Freedom of assembly (ICCPR, Article 21)
           Freedom of association (ICCPR, Article 22)
       •	    Right to participate in government (Universal Declaration, Article 21).

       These rights are guided by a set of principles, including universality and nondiscrimination, recognizing that all people hold them and should be able to
       enjoy them without discrimination.

  SPOTLIGHT 1:
  Current challenges in the education system in Afghanistan

  The public education system in Afghanistan suffered decades of upheaval in the 1980s (Soviet occupation) and 1990s (civil war and the emergence of the
  Taliban’s movement). Since 2002, however, education has been one of Afghanistan’s success stories. In 2001 no girls attended formal schools, and boys’
  enrollment was 1 million. By 2014 the total net enrollment rate in primary schools (ages 7–13, grades 1–6) was 86 percent.

  Despite this progress, coverage in secondary education (ages 13–19, grades 7–12) remains a major problem with a net enrollment rate of 48 percent. Fur-
  thermore, access to education in Afghanistan still suffers from significant disparities across gender, geographical location, and household income. In 2014
  girls’ enrollment reached 71 percent for primary education and 35 percent for secondary education, and girls’ dropout rates are high in the secondary
  grades. In addition, the higher education enrollment ratio is about 5 percent, which is one of the lowest participation rates in the world, and it contributes
  to the adult literacy rate, which is one of the lowest in the world, about 38 percent (World Bank 2016).

  The education sector in Afghanistan faces a number of challenges, including poor infrastructure, poor-quality teachers, and lack of resources.

  Infrastructure. In 2015, of the total registered schools only about half had proper buildings (the rest were operating as home-based schooling—in tents,
  houses, and under trees). Furthermore, most schools had inadequate facilities—that is, 62 percent lacked surrounding walls, 31 percent lacked drinking
  water, 33 percent lacked functional sanitation facilities, and 76 percent lacked electricity, all of which negatively affected access and retention (Ministry of
  Education 2015, 2016; World Bank 2016).

  Poor quality and shortage of teachers. Only 38 percent of all teachers meet the requirements of becoming a teacher (14th grade graduate). The remaining
  who have not yet met the criteria to be professional teachers are recruited as contact teachers in remote areas. The shortage of teachers is evidenced by the
  high pupil-teacher ratio of 45:1 (2013). Only 28 percent of the total number of teachers are female. They are located primarily in urban areas, which has
  important implications for female student attendance. In 2012 about 31 percent of schools were running on multiple shifts and consequently on reduced
  teaching hours. Absenteeism from the classroom—by both teachers and students—necessarily interrupts and shortens learning time (Ministry of Education
  2015; World Bank 2016).

  Low expenditure on education. As of 2015, the government expenditure in the education sector in Afghanistan as a share of GDP remained low at 3.2
  percent, falling from 3.46 percent in 2010 to 2.53 percent in 2012 and 3.32 in 2015.

        Box 3.1: Recollections of an IWA provincial coordinator

        Ali Ahmad Mashal Afroz, IWA provincial coordinator, Kapisa:

        I remember when my friends and I saw the Sher Khan High School in Kohistan-e-Awal for the first time in 2015; there were no walls except the one where
        a door had once been. At first all we saw were classrooms in ruins and without students. A few steps further there were some students studying in an open
        area who complained to us about the school’s condition. During social gatherings and talks with community members we were able to make them aware
        of how they could make a difference. We encouraged them to identify the specific problems with their school and encouraged them to engage with the
        Education Department. It is worth mentioning that the local people had already complained to the Education Department authorities but without success.

        Today, after two years, there have been huge changes at Sher Khan High School: 750 meters of school walls have been constructed thanks to a $60,000
        grant from the Education Department’s budget and a contribution of 228,000 Afghanis (about $3,500) from the community. These walls now protect both
        students and staff. The local people and the local management shura (SMS) also provided the school with potable water at a cost of approximately 41,000
        Afghanis (about $600). The people connected the deep well, located about 1.5 kilometers north of the school, to the school with pipes. The SMS will invite
        representatives of the government to the inauguration of this project in the near future, and large participation is expected. There are now regular monthly
        meetings of the SMS, hygiene and security have improved, all teachers have teaching plans, student discipline is good, and the interaction between the
        school administrators and the students’ parents has improved significantly.

   Box 3.2: Monitoring teacher absenteeism and “ghost teachers”

   Nazeera was a local monitor, chosen by her community for the Ishaq-Abaq Girls High School in Parwan province. In the course of her regular monitoring,
   she uncovered “ghost teachers,” also known as “paper teachers,” who were regularly absent for long periods of time but still drawing salaries. One of them
   was the husband of the school principal. Although the school list indicated that there were enough teachers for every subject, in speaking with students
   Nazeera heard complaints about the shortage of teachers. She then shared her findings with the school management, but the principal told her to keep
   quiet and threatened her with reprisals if she revealed the information.

   The monitor told her husband what had transpired, and he encouraged her to tell the community through the local shura. She shared her discovery with
   local female shura members, other community members, as well as with the Department of Education at the Jabal Saraj district level. “Local community
   members and local female shuras went to the school, all together as one body and conducted a meeting with the school management and informed the
   school management to remove all the ghost teachers names from the list,” reports Khadija Mehmood, program officer for CBM-S. News of this achieve-
   ment led to changes at other schools. Local monitors informed IWA that other ghost teachers were cleared from school lists, and teachers are now arriving
   on time and are signing attendance sheets. When interviewed for this case study, Nazeera avowed, “My commitment is to my work, which I learned in the
   training conducted by Integrity Watch Afghanistan to fight corruption and establish accountability. I promised to myself to deal determinedly with every
   problem that faces me.”

          SPOTLIGHT 2:
          Current challenges in the education system in Paraguay

          Paraguay has made progress in expanding public school enrollment. As of 2015, it had achieved universal coverage (98 percent) in primary schools. But
          enrollment rates are lower in the third cycle of basic education (grades 7–9). The real bottleneck in the education system, however, is secondary schools
          (grades 10–12), where enrollment rates were 73.8 percent in 2015. In addition, enrollment is low and dropout rates high among disadvantaged groups in
          rural areas, especially in secondary schools (64.5 percent net enrollment), affecting the equity of the education system.
          The system is also producing poor overall student learning outcomes, as evident in the results of the latest standardized national test that are available
          publicly. According to the Sistema Nacional de Evaluación del Proceso Educativo (SNEPE), only one in four students in the third grade have the required
          levels of math and communication skills, and the performance in communication is lower among students attending rural schools (De Hoyos 2013).
          Similarly, according to results from the Tercer Estudio Regional Comparativo y Explicativo (TERCE), Paraguay has one of the worst-performing education
          systems in the region, ahead of only the Dominican Republic. Moreover, student performance shows significant variations across learning areas. This is an
          additional challenge for the education system because it requires not only improving the average learning outcome but also achieving a more homoge-
          neous performance across different learning areas (UNESCO 2015).
          The key challenges facing the Paraguayan education system in providing high-quality education for all of its children are public schools that lack of basic
          infrastructure and employ poor-quality teachers. This situation is reinforced by low levels of public spending on the education sector overall and on infra-
          structure investments specifically (Wodon 2016).
          Infrastructure. All basic education institutions are required to fulfill the minimum physical infrastructure and equipment standards defined by Decree
          6589. Despite the legal mandate, most schools in Paraguay fall short of this requirement: only 11 percent of urban schools and virtually no rural schools
          are considered to be in “good” condition (that is, have basic infrastructure) and almost two in three schools in rural areas are in “poor” condition, lacking
          basics facilities such as bathrooms, drinkable water, and electricity.
          Poor-quality teachers. Although Paraguay has made important progress in improving the quality of the teacher recruitment process, many challenges
          remain: (1) the pedagogical institutes (Institutos de Formación Docente) are poorly regulated and do not ensure a minimum quality for all of their
          graduates; (2) almost 40 percent of the in-service teachers are not certified or have qualifications that do not correspond to their teaching duties; (3) formal
          schemes for continual education and skill upgrades are lacking; and (4) remuneration is not based on years of experience.	
          Government expenditure on education. As of 2015, the government expenditure on educational institutions in Paraguay as a share of GDP remained
          below the regional average of 5 percent—and it only increased from 3.2 percent in 2003 to 4.4 percent in 2015. However, the proportion of the total
          education budget allocated to capital investments remained low, at about 6 percent over the 2003–15 period, accounting for the poor conditions of the
          school infrastructure.

  Box 3.3: The National Public Investment and Development Fund (FONACIDE)

  The following description of FONACIDE is taken from the Inter-American Development Bank’s Country Program Evaluation: Paraguay 2009–2013 (Office of
  Evaluation and Oversight, IDB 2014, 5):

  In May 2011, the Brazilian Congress approved the agreement under which the price of power transfers from Paraguay to Brazil was renegotiated, thereby
  increasing Paraguay’s revenue from US$120 million to US$360 million (1.6% of GDP in 2011). . . . Given the magnitude of those additional resources, a
  debate ensued regarding their use, which included civil society (education NGO “Juntos por la Educacion”), which advocated using the resources to finance
  investments in the sector. In September 2012, the second bill was passed: Law 4758 creating the National Public Investment and Development Fund
  (FONACIDE). Under this law, 30% of the funds would be earmarked for a National Fund for Excellence in Education and Research (FNEEI), 28% for infrastruc-
  ture, 25% for departmental and municipal governments, 10% for health, and 7% to finance the Development Finance Agency (AFD). The law also provided
  that, under the FNEEI, a series of minimums and maximums would be distributed among various investment categories (information and communication
  technology, education supply, scholarships. . . .

  Under the FONACIDE law (Articles 14 and 15), the Fund will be administered financially by the AFD and will be governed by a board of directors chaired by
  the Minister of Finance and made up of the Minister of Education and Culture, the Minister of Public Health and Social Welfare, the Technical Secretary for
  Planning, and the President of the National Science and Technology Council (CONACYT). In addition, four education experts appointed by the President of
  the Republic would participate in the leadership of the board, though with no voting rights. The main function of the board is to decide on the proposed
  investment projects, ensuring the proper use of FONACIDE’s resources (Article 16).

     40.	 While he was president of the student council in his high school, Riveros García led an investigation into the use of school resources by its board of direc-
     tors. He and a team of students presented their evidence to the Ministry of Education, which ignored it, along with a petition to audit the school. The students
     then launched a three-week protest, including a classroom strike and a march to the center of Ciudad del Este. The Ministry of Education then agreed to the
     audit, which took four years to complete. Riveros García reports that this experience drove him to create reAcción Paraguay.

          The FONACIDE policy arena consists of elites from the following institutions and other actors:

               Ministry of Education (director of planning, local supervision offices, school principals, open data portal). Interaction at all levels, from the minister of
                 education downward, was deemed necessary because of the fund’s decentralized structure. The director of planning coordinates the entire process by
                 which schools identify infrastructure needs and works with municipalities and submunicipal bodies to create priority lists of schools based on need.

               Office of the Comptroller General. This body is responsible for monitoring the execution of FONACIDE, and, under the law, municipalities are sup-

               Technical Planning Secretariat. This body is in charge of leading the Open Government Partnership initiative in Paraguay.
               Local municipal government (mayor of the municipality of Ciudad del Este, director of infrastructure and urban development, Junta Municipal). Local
                 governments are responsible for carrying out public procurement and construction for FONACIDE. They fund education infrastructure projects and are
                 supposed to ensure that work is conducted according to contract specifications.
               Nonstate actors (from civil society, the media, higher education, and the legal community, as well as international actors related to the Open Govern-

      Enhance control over discretional spending at the local level by way of improving communication between the Ministry of Education and the schools
        so that there is increased knowledge of how the fund works
      Publicize comprehensive information about FONACIDE widely, including how it works, key actors at the local level (given its decentralized process),
        and online tools and portals for citizens to use to access information
      Allocate a small percentage of FONACIDE for distribution to each municipality to enable public deliberation opportunities for beneficiaries and
        communities regarding fund administration and allocations, as well as to train citizens in social accountability methods so they can contribute to its
        administration.

       SPOTLIGHT 3:
       Current challenges in the health care system in Serbia

       Serbia’s key health outcomes are good for its income level: life expectancy at birth is 75 and the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is 17 per 100,000 live
       births (2015). The under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) declined from 28 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 7 per 1,000 live births in 2015 and the infant mortality
       rate from 24 to 6 per 1,000 live births in the same period. However, poor and marginalized groups—such as the Roma—have worse health and nutrition
       outcomes (World Bank 2015c).

       As the population of Serbia has aged, the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has grown. Since 1990, the Serbian population has decreased by
       an average of about –0.2 percent annually. The percentage of the population age 65 and over went up from 10 in 1990 to 14 percent in 2012, and it is
       projected to reach 25 percent by 2050. Because of its aging population, the disease burden in Serbia is now weighted toward NCDs and external causes
       such as injuries. The top three causes of premature death in 2010 were heart disease (19.9 percent), stroke (18.8 percent), and cancers (about 18 percent),
       which implies that coverage and quality of prevention, promotion, and first-line screening and treatment at the primary care levels are key (World Bank
       2015b).

       The health care system in Serbia is based on universal health coverage. About 94 percent of the population has health insurance, but lower-income groups
       tend to have higher unmet medical needs and lower insurance coverage (HPI 2014; World Bank 2015c). Besides the need to expand the access to care for
       marginalized groups, other major challenges in Serbian publicly funded health care are improving the quality of care and health outcomes and enhancing
       the efficiency of health spending.

       Health care quality. Use of hospital care went up between 2006 and 2013. In a recent survey, 7.8 percent of respondents age 15 and over (compared with
       6.5 percent in 2006) said they had been treated in a hospital in the 12 months preceding the survey. This increase cannot be explained just by the aging
       of the population. Other factors are also responsible, including unnecessary hospital admissions, shortcomings in primary care, excessive use of acute
       care beds for long-term care, and inadequate use of day surgery. Wait lists for elective procedures are frequent and significantly longer than in member
       countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). They contribute to the high prevalence of bribery, particularly in the
       hospital sector (World Bank 2015b).

       Inefficient government expenditure on health. In Serbia, total public health spending increased from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2000 to 6.4 percent in 2013,
       higher than the average for upper-middle-income countries (3.9 percent) and slightly higher than the European Union average (6.3 percent). In the West-
       ern Balkans, only Bosnia and Herzegovina spends more on health. In 2009–13, Serbia’s per capita government health spending was three times higher at
       US$715 per capita per year than the average for countries with similar GDPs, US$298 per capita per year. Despite Serbia’s considerably higher spending,
       its health outcomes are similar and sometimes lower than those of other Central European countries, which suggests that inefficiency in the use of public
       funds combined with corruption is a primary concern for national authorities. For example, there are only five hospital beds for every 1,000 Serbians—lower
       than the Europe and Central Asia average (World Bank 2015a, 2015b).

       Box 3.7: Serbia on the Move’s project structure

       Predrag Stojičić, a medical doctor, was exposed to the community organizing resources developed by Marshall Ganz, a senior lecturer in public policy at the
       Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, before he co-founded Serbia on the Move in 2009. He
       and his co-founder, Ana Babović, further studied Ganz’s approach through online resources and discovered they were already practicing much of his model.
       After Ganz launched a distance learning course in 2010, Stojičić convinced SoM’s core leadership to take it, and they adapted what they learned to the Ser-
       bian context (see figure B3.6.1).

       In the snowflake model, citizen mobilization is integrated into project organization rather than treated as a stand-alone objective. At the center is the core
       leadership team, initially the founding young professionals of SoM. At the next level are the project leadership teams. Each member at the core of a project
       team is in charge of leading the people (volunteers) working on one functional part of the project. Common functional teams include education and training
       (including leadership development), community organizing, logistics and public actions, public relations, and evaluation. The community organizing team
       is responsible for recruiting team leaders, who in turn are tasked with recruiting10 volunteers on the ground. In this framework, interdependent leadership
       teams are composed of individuals who bring complementary strengths to bear on solving the problem. Collaboration is essential to create “power to” based
       on the interests of all parties. Each SoM project has its own leadership team.

       Using analytical resources developed by Ganz, SoM conducts a strategic analysis of each citizen engagement project incorporating the following compo-

deal with development problems, things will not change. Collective ownership refers to the personal sense individuals have that “I am needed, and my own
efforts will contribute to achieving our shared goals and success.” Collective identity, according to sociologist Lee Smithey, is a shared sense of “we-ness” that
comes from shared cognitions, beliefs, and emotions among a group of people seeking positive change (Smithey 2013, 32). Also see Beyerle (2015).

     The mission of Serbia on the Move (Srbija u Pokretu) is to build a strong and responsible civil society through motivating
     individuals to take an active part in creating changes that will improve their lives.

     MANIFESTO

     During the past five years, Serbia on the Move has conducted projects in the areas of fighting against corruption in health care,
     environmental protection, accessibility, and the labor rights of women, and we have educated citizens in modes of community
     organizing.

     In our work, we stick to three basic principles: (1) citizens’ support, (2) social activism, and (3) transparency.

     Serbia on the Move brings together people who are not satisfied with simply talking about problems and criticizing others, but
     who wish to be active and work on solving those problems.

     WE WISH FOR SERBIA TO BE A COUNTRY WHERE:
     1.	 We are free to express and organize ourselves, and we do not wait for others to solve our problems.
     2.	 Modern education and science are available to us, and we continuously work on our personal development.
     3.	 We make progress in accordance with how much we are worth and how much we work
     4.	 We know the rules, and the same law applies to all.
     5.	 Government is a service of citizens, not a restraining force.
     6.	 Health is a right of everyone, not a privilege of individuals.
     7.	 We respect the lives and safety of all.
     8.	 We accept diversity and we are solidary.
     9.	 We live in a society of equal opportunities and accessibility for all.
     10.	 We look after nature and we do not pollute it.
     11.	 We use the media critically and the internet is available to all of us.
     12.	 Art and culture are available to us.
     13.	 We volunteer for the community and that is an honour to us.

     To turn such a Serbia into reality, it is necessary that all of us who wish to live in such a country work on realization of the 13
     points daily and live in accordance with them.

Since 2014, the World Bank Group (WBG) has formally mainstreamed citizen engagement
in its strategy to end extreme poverty and share prosperity, building on 25 years of emerging
practice and research. In the early 2000s, the WBG issued guidance on multistakeholder
engagement to strengthen accountability relationships through citizen participation and
ensure that the benefits of development projects reached the poor. Most recently, the
development community has acknowledged that development outcomes improve when
citizens participate in development, leading to the WBG mandate to mainstream citizen
engagement across sectors and countries.

      The research described in this report, made possible through the Nordic Trust Fund
(NTF), a multidonor knowledge and learning program on human rights for WB staff, aims
to deepen understanding of citizen engagement in the development arena through in-
depth study of three grassroots initiatives in which empowered citizens played a central
role. The research complements existing approaches by explicitly adopting a human
rights perspective as well as focusing on organic citizen-led initiatives rather than WBG- or
client-initiated projects. In analyzing these cases, this report applies the framework of the
World Development Report 2017: Governance and the Law (WDR 2017) to understand
how citizens effectively disrupted the persistent power asymmetries that undermined
development outcomes. This report analyzes citizen engagement to reduce corruption in
service delivery in three diverse settings: in Afghanistan, improving education outcomes
through community-based monitoring of schools; in Paraguay, monitoring sovereign
wealth fund resources allocated to education to improve the infrastructure of marginalized
schools; and in Serbia, promoting transparency and the integrity of physicians to reduce
corruption in the health sector.
