Trade and Competitiveness (T&C)

The Trade and Competitiveness (T&C) Global Practice helps countries achieve the World
Bank Group Twin Goals through rapid and broad-based economic growth, centered on
strong contributions from the private sector. For our clients across lower- and middle-income
countries and fragile and conflict-affected states, integration through trade and a focus on
competitiveness are keys to economic growth. T&C is meeting growing demand for high-impact
solutions that expand market opportunities, enable private initiatives, and develop dynamic
economies. Its country, regional, and global efforts help boost the volume and value of trade,
enhance the investment climate, improve competitiveness in sectors, and foster innovation and
entrepreneurship. This joint World Bank–International Finance Corporation (WB-IFC) team of
over 500 staff members offers world-class technical expertise, an extensive global footprint,
and an updated business model. T&C’s day-to-day business is characterized by intensive
learning-by-doing, strong internal and external partnerships, and a focus on results. The Climate
Competitive Industries work within T&C assists countries with addressing climate action within
the manufacturing sector while supporting the competitiveness of the sector.
Foreword

Climate variability and resource scarcity pose an increasing threat to the growth and competitiveness
of industry, and nowhere is this issue more significant than in the world’s emerging economies.
Governments and industry must work together to tackle this challenge. The World Bank Group’s
Climate Competitive Industries (CCI) initiative aims to assist client governments to improve the
competitiveness of their manufacturing industry, by facilitating the adoption of cleaner technologies
and more efficient practices, tailored to the needs of the private sector.

This Guide is designed to provide practitioners with an understanding of the CCI initiative and
step-by-step guidance on how to design, develop, and implement a CCI or equivalent program.
As well as practicioners, the Guide will be of value other resource efficiency stakeholders,
including: owners, managers, and engineers within industrial enterprises; industrial trade bodies
and chambers of commerce; and local and central government departments with responsibilities
for industrial efficiency, energy policy, or environmental protection.
The Guide is divided into four Modules

Module 1:                                          Module 2:

to raise awareness and work with the core
stakeholders throughout the process.



Whilst the guide concentrates on energy efficiency, the principles can be equally applied to
programs on water efficiency or waste reduction.

The Guide includes and signposts various practical tools that can be used by the relevant
practitioners to make key decisions and/or plans and develop CCI or equivalent programs.

1.	Introduction

The pressing need to act on climate change
Climate change is already happening; the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface
temperature has warmed by 0.85°C over the period 1880 to 20121. The mean global sea level
has risen by around 20 cm with significant contributions now coming from the melting ice sheets
over Greenland and Antarctica. Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased in every season and in every
successive decade since 1979, and, almost worldwide, glaciers continue to shrink.

Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era,
driven by economic and population growth. The current atmospheric concentrations of carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. There is
a high degree of confidence that GHG emissions from human activities are the dominant cause of
the observed surface warming since the mid-20th century.

If we make no efforts to cut the use of fossil fuels, global warming is likely to reach between
2-7°C this century with further warming beyond. This would have major consequences for human
welfare and ecological systems.

The Copenhagen Accord2 was agreed at the 15th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 15)
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2009. The
Accord recognized the scientific view, as documented in the IPCC’s 4th Assessment Report, that
the increase in global temperature should be kept to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels
to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Subsequently, at
the December 2010 COP 16 in Cancun3, the Parties agreed to commit to the 2°C maximum
temperature increase and to consider lowering this to 1.5°C in the near future.

     In December 2015 at COP 21 in Paris, agreement was reached to strengthen the global response
     to the threat of climate change by, inter alia:

     “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial
     levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,
     recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”4.

     Achieving the 2°C limit, let alone 1.5°C, represents a significant challenge for the global
     community; it requires a large global emissions reduction of 40–70% in GHGs from 2010 levels
     by 2050 and near- or below-zero global GHG emission levels by 2100.

     The estimated aggregate greenhouse gas emission levels in 2025 and 2030 resulting from
     the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)5 promised by countries at the
     Paris Climate Change Conference is insufficient to achieve the goal of preventing the global
     average temperature from increasing by 2°C or less. To hold the increase in the global average
     temperature to below 2°C, 2030 emissions need to be reduced to an estimated 40 GtCO2e
     (giga-tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), whereas the INDCs lead to a projected level of
     55 GtCO2e in 2030. It is clear that significant global action is required if we are to avoid the worst
     impacts of climate change.

     The resource crunch
     Climate change is not the only issue. With increasing global population and demand for better
     qualities of life, many resources are under greater pressure, which will increase prices and
     compromise availability. The Global Footprint Network estimates that humanity’s demand on
     nature has exceeded what our planet can replenish for the last 40 years as shown in Figure 16.
     The world’s population would need the regenerative capacity of 1.5 Earths to provide the
     ecological services the world currently uses. Such “overshoot” is possible because we can

     	 In December 2013, all Parties to the UNFCCC were invited to communicate their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
        (INDCs) well in advance of the Paris Conference. These contributions outline national efforts towards low emissions and climate
        resilient development in pursuit of the Convention’s objective and represent one of the main deliverables of COP 21.

The US National Intelligence Council7 has identified the “Megatrend” of the growing food, water,
and energy nexus. Demand for these resources will grow by approximately 35, 40, and 50 percent
respectively by 2030 owing to an increase in the global population and the consumption patterns
of an expanding middle class. Climate change will worsen the outlook for the availability of these
critical resources. The impact of this resource crunch is potentially huge for businesses, dramatically
influencing the cost and availability of materials and the products and services they provide.

The economic case for resource efficient industry
The economic case for green industry is clear. Industrialization continues to be the most
significant driver for income and job creation, and therefore the protection and acceleration of
growth in this sector is critical for poverty reduction in emerging economies8.

     The main benefits to the economy from the increased uptake of industrial efficiency measures are
     as follows:
     1.	 Industrial efficiency is cost effective. Investments in clean technologies typically have
         relatively short payback periods and lead to lower operating costs. After the initial cost,
         enterprises save money through decreased resource use, decreased risk of liability and
         remediation costs, reduced insurance costs, whilst also generating increased revenue through
         improved productivity;
     2.	 A relatively high economic multiplier effect is common with public investment in industrial
         efficiency because in addition to improving productivity, resource efficiency provides a tangible
         financial return on investment;
     3.	 Improved competitiveness is achieved as business and innovation potential is released
         through cost savings or new income flows, that can be utilized to drive expansion, create new
         jobs, and invest in further resource productivity improvements;
     4.	 Job creation. The number of green jobs is on the rise. In 2006 42% of global steel output
         was recycled, saving 25% energy and employing ~200,000 people9;
     5.	 Spill-over effects including demonstration effects, capacity building of workers and
         technological learning10;
     6.	 Growth in demand for sustainable products means
         that enterprises in emerging economies that comply with
         sustainability standards and customer demands can gain
         access to new global markets, with price premiums for
         their products;
     7.	 Innovation and risk are not obstacles. Most emerging
         economies would struggle to finance their own
         research and development (R&D) programs. However,
         industrial efficiency can be improved by scaling-up and
         mainstreaming proven practices and technologies that
         reduce resource consumption and emissions (see box).

cost of the investment is even lower12.

As well as economic reasons, there is also a growing international call for action on climate change.
Action in industrial efficiency represents a cost-effective method of reducing national emissions
in line with international or national climate change emissions targets. Reducing the threat of
environmental pollution on public health is another benefit of action in this area, particularly in
emerging economies. Improved industrial efficiency can improve access to clean water, energy (from
a reliable grid)13 and improved nutrition from sustainable agricultural land management. Greening
industries can also help build resilience to environmental risks by reducing direct harmful exposure
to pollutants, such as those in air, water, food and solid waste.

     Strategy lag within the private sector
     Governments around the world are working towards the development of policies, regulations
     and incentives to reduce GHG emissions and improve resource efficiency. At the same time,
     governments are seeking to drive economic growth. The industry sector may be among the most
     affected by government action in this direction.

     Worldwide, many governments have implemented climate change (or related) programs aimed at
     encouraging industry sectors to become more resource efficient. Such programs often fail to gain
     sufficient traction with industry, unless they are mandatory schemes that are rigorously enforced.
     Industrial operators can be reluctant to participate, being untrusting of government actions
     and of the benefits promised, whilst also fearing the impact that change could have on their
     competitiveness, if not equally applied to other operators.

     There is a need for more inclusion of the private sector in order to understand what will work
     best within a particular industry sector, or even within a specific business. The focus of the private
     sector is naturally on business efficiency and profitability rather than tackling climate change.
     However, improving the resource efficiency of business has a direct positive impact on business
     efficiency by reducing costs and waste, and by consequence providing a climate change benefit.

     Increasingly businesses around the globe are being driven to reduce emissions of the main GHG,
     carbon dioxide, through energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy as governments
     adopt fiscal policies that incentivize action. Pressures on the supply chain are also increasing as the
     owners of global brands appreciate the benefits of an ethical image underpinned by responsible
     corporate behavior of suppliers as well as the brand operator itself. The focus is often on issues
     such as employee conditions and health and safety, but also encompasses the responsible use of
     resources, including energy and water.

     Improving the management of resources reduces operating costs of a business, increases margins
     and helps to support growth. It can also enhance corporate image, helping to differentiate
     companies and their products in a global market.

In an increasingly resource constrained world, resource efficiency also lowers risks through making
companies less vulnerable to sudden price increases and constraints in the availability of process
inputs or materials. In this respect, it is important to understand that resource efficiency is not just
about reducing the quantities used, it is also about finding alternative ways of doing things that
are less exposed to external influences. For example, on-site generation of renewable power from
solar or wind can help insulate a site from grid reliability issues and from price volatility.

According to research undertaken by the Carbon Trust in 201214, companies remain unprepared
for the effects of dwindling natural resources. The study showed that amongst 475 senior
executives in Brazil, China, Korea, UK and USA, many are not prepared to look at the issue of
resource shortages now and believe they will not need to make significant changes in their
business operations to combat resource scarcity until 2018. Most consumer-facing companies
predicted that they would only need to take action within the next ten to fifteen years at the
earliest, meaning they may not have plans in place until 2025 or beyond. This inaction was found
to be widespread, with 43% of organizations surveyed stating that they do not monitor the risks
to their business of environmentally related shocks such as energy price rises and environmental
disasters. Over a half (52%) have not set targets for managing the reduction of carbon, water
or waste. However, when
resource constraints become a
reality, 60% of organizations
think the cost of their
products and services will
need to increase, 55% show
that they will need to engage
in fewer markets and 43%
show that they will deliver a
less varied service or product
offering. Such responses
would clearly have an impact
on business profitability and
growth.

     2.	 Challenges for industries in emerging
     	economies

     Climate efficient industry faces particular challenges in emerging economies. This section considers
     these challenges and how governments around the world have sought to overcome them.

     In pursuit of rapid short-term growth, many emerging economies now face extensive
     environmental degradation and resource depletion that threaten opportunities for sustainable
     industrial development and long-term economic growth. Industrial activity in these countries is
     often characterized by inefficient use of energy, water and raw materials, and relatively limited
     pollution controls.

     The development of resource efficient industry addresses these inefficiencies, whilst at the same time
     promoting sustainable economic growth and relieving stress on the environment. The case for green
     industry is clear and convincing, yet there are barriers that often prevent industries from taking action.

     The barriers faced by emerging economies seeking sustainable industrial growth are varied and
     complex, but broadly comprise a combination of financial, market and policy failures. These
     common barriers will differ in influence across countries but will be present to some degree
     everywhere. This section outlines the challenges to wide-scale uptake of efficient industrial
     practices in emerging economies.

     Financial constraints
     The World Bank has been identified access to finance as the primary business constraint faced by
     firms in emerging economies15. This acts as a major barrier to the uptake of resource efficiency
     improvements, in particular for small or medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, there
     is often the misconception amongst businesses that sustainability initiatives are in conflict with
     commercial interests. These factors conspire to limit the uptake of sustainable industry practices.

Access to finance is constrained for a number of reasons. Financiers will often lack awareness of
the investment opportunity presented by efficiency measures and perceive the investment risk to be
high, due to a lack of reliable information on technology, markets, and investment potential. SMEs
can be at a further disadvantage as they may not be able to obtain the collateral and third party
guarantees that financiers can insist upon; the emphasis financial institutions place on asset-based
lending and balance sheet financing favors larger firms. In addition, credit lines extended to SMEs
for efficiency investments are typically characterized by numerous smaller projects that are seen
as having a higher risk compared with the returns16. These factors highlight the need for public or
donor support to provide leverage for private sector capital and to share the risk with the investor17.

Indirect cost constraints or ‘hidden’ costs also play an important role. These costs are more
difficult to account for, which can lead enterprises to place a higher risk premium on these types
of investment. Common indirect costs include:
•	 management and staff time;
•	 transaction costs (e.g. information gathering and analysis, negotiation, procurement, etc.);
•	 disruption of business activity and inconvenience;
•	 equipment incompatibility;
•	 staff training and replacement; and
•	 technical support and maintenance.

SMEs face some indirect costs disproportionately. For example, SMEs tend to be less aware
of efficiency opportunities and may lack the skills necessary for implementation. In such
circumstances there is likely to be an additional cost for support from consultants, intermediaries
or ESCOs. SMEs also have greater difficulty accessing public support and grants for the same
reasons. Moreover, fostering resource efficiency often requires a value chain approach, with a
need for coordination and cooperation between enterprises, which may exceed the capabilities of
individual SMEs.

     Corporate behavior
     Where access to capital is not a constraint, companies often overlook resource efficiency
     opportunities due to corporate behaviors, including:
     •	 a lack of prioritization. Many enterprises do not view resource efficiency as a core business
        activity. Instead, improvements in efficiency are often treated as operating expenditure, for
        which budgets are set and limited.
     •	 a rule of thumb approach to investment decisions. Projects are frequently judged
        against a payback period threshold rather than by a full life-time assessment. These
        are compared with other projects that are competing for the same capital and that can
        potentially yield more immediate financial returns. Many companies will only fund projects
        with a payback period of less than 18-24 months, unless the project has a simultaneous
        productivity or growth outcome18.
     •	 dispersed benefits. Where the benefits of an investment are spread between departments
        within a business, there may not be sufficient incentive for any one budget holder to supply
        the capital for the investment19.
     •	 a perception of efficiency investments as complicated and risky. Energy efficiency
        investments, for example, may seem to pose a high risk due to a lack of familiarity with
        such projects in comparison with core business projects, and uncertainty in predicting future
        energy prices.

     Market failure
     Market failure refers to situations in which the market does not, and cannot by itself, be expected
     to, price goods and services at their true cost. In the context of industrial resource efficiency, three
     types of market barriers are relevant:
     •	 externalities describe a situation in which a third party incurs a cost or benefit, as a result
         of a transaction in which they were not involved. For example, the costs of environmental
         degradation to an economy as a result of the inefficient practices of industry is not carried by
         the companies concerned. Consequently, efficient practices are under-valued;

•	 incomplete information or ‘imperfect’ information refers to a lack of access to information
   concerning efficiency opportunities. To make effective choices an enterprise must have access
   to clear and reliable information on the opportunities presented by efficiency measures. This is
   particularly critical for SMEs, which can be limited by a lack of internal technical capacity20;
•	 split incentives occur when the investor cannot capture the benefits of the investment. In the
   industrial sector, split incentives can occur where a property owner has no incentive to improve
   the efficiency of the facilities their tenants are using, as the savings would not accrue to the
   owner.

Governments will sometimes intervene to correct market failures; however, top-down
manipulation of the market can create price distortions that prevent customers from appraising
the true value of resource efficiency measures. For example, where energy prices are subsidized,
businesses do not pay the full cost of their energy use, and therefore have less incentive to reduce
consumption. Further details on government action on green industry are provided in this Module
under Stimulating climate competitive industry, and details on how to diagnose the current
market situation can be found in Module 2 under Sub-step 2.1: Assessing the market.

     Policy, regulatory and institutional challenges
     Where the market fails to promote efficient practices, there is a case for policy and regulation
     to support and promote greener industry. However, emerging economies may lack the
     legal and policy frameworks necessary to address the environmental challenges they face.
     Furthermore, governments do not tend to prioritize natural resource management and as a result
     environmental ministries or agencies have generally less influential than ministries of finance,
     trade, and industrial development.

     The greening of industry represents a cross-cutting and long-term challenge, and many
     governments fail to address the range of issues it presents in a holistic way. This leads to tension
     between environmental policies and industrial development. Factors such as inconsistent policy
     communication and enforcement, diverse delivery bodies and overlapping regulations can all
     hinder implementation.

     There is also the possibility that existing regulations are hampering industrial efficiency. Regulation
     can impose administrative costs on firms and shape their perceptions about the cost of efficiency
     measures. For example, where21:
     •	 regulations are unclear or subject to change;
     •	 regulations are too complex and require third party intervention to be clarified;
     •	 regulations are too numerous, creating confusion and potentially imposing overlapping
        regulatory burdens;
     •	 where there is a lack of coordination between regulators to ensure consistent enforcement
        across sectors and geographical areas.

     Policy, regulatory and institutional issues can generally be expected to be more burdensome to
     SMEs than to large enterprises that have greater resources to manage them. Guidance on how to
     conduct a diagnostic on the current policy and regulatory context is presented in Module 2: Sub-
     step 2.2: Assessing the regulatory and institutional context.

3.	 Opportunities for industry and the
	economy

Resource efficiency is a matter of business survival; in a resource constrained world only the
most efficient companies will endure. Yet, the path to becoming a climate competitive industry
presents opportunities as well as challenges. The opportunity for cost reduction is the usual driver
for industry adoption of more efficient practices, but there are many other benefits, including18:
•	 enhanced productivity and competitiveness;
•	 reduced exposure to volatile energy and raw material prices;
•	 the fostering of innovative technology development and adoption;
•	 the achievement of voluntary or mandatory environmental targets (e.g. carbon reduction);
•	 the ability to take advantage of increasing customer requirements for environmentally
    conscious manufacturing processes and end products;
•	 improved corporate reputation.

The industry sector is facing shifts every day in both supply and demand behavior. On the supply
side, input materials may be increasing in cost, may be more difficult to obtain and even become
scarce over time. On the demand side, markets shift at a higher rate demanding higher quality
finished goods. This trend is not new, as increasing productivity has been a goal for several years
in the private sector, but markets will contain higher risks in the coming years due to climate
change22 and resource constraints.

Sustainability in the private sector has become a target in recent years mostly because of shifts
in the market. An increasingly integrated global value chain, accompanied by knowledge
dissemination, has induced new supply-demand channels. This creates new business models,
opportunities, and challenges. The private sector gains a variety of opportunities such as
reputation management, operational improvements and new growth. Private sector leaders
need to rethink their organizational structures, market engagement, production processes and
environmental actions in order to mitigate and manage these supply and demand risks.

     Integrating environmental, social and governance issues into current business models will help
     industry to prepare for the risks presented. These issues are not new to the private sector,
     but they tend not to be part of companies’ core strategic planning; sustainability needs to be
     understood as an issue with a direct impact on business results.

     The growing demand for sustainable products and services, good corporate governance and
     social responsibility, linked with scarcer resources and tighter regulatory requirements are some
     of the reasons why it is important for industries to take the lead within CCI programs23. Business
     leadership, with government support, can facilitate the creation of competitive and practical
     programs that aim to:
     1.	 increase resource efficiency in a cost-effective way;
     2.	 decarbonize energy sources;
     3.	 accelerate the development and deployment of
         low-carbon/energy-efficient and resource efficient
         technologies and practices;
     4.	 adjust to business and consumer behaviors.

     Several types of effective industry-led resource efficiency
     initiatives have been adopted across the world in order
     to realize the benefits. These are often encouraged by
     government support as shown in the examples provided
     in Table 1. In countries that have effective industry-led
     initiatives, the design of any new resource efficiency
     programs should consider whether they could reinforce or
     complement the developments already happening in the
     market.

The two boxes below, concerning the cement and iron & steel sectors, provide examples of
opportunities for industrial processes to become more efficient by using improved technologies and
the substitution of inputs. In each sector efficiency improvements have been driven by demand,
mostly from the construction sector. However, in both cases government has an important role to
play through the provision of fiscal incentives for improved technologies, research and development,
and other support for the private sector to apply these measures without undue risk24.

        Opportunities in the cement sector
        Emissions from the production of cement arise from the fuel combustion used to heat clay,
        limestone and other minerals, and from the calcination reaction of the input materials. The
        IPCC’s fifth assessment report identified the global cement sector’s GHG emissions to be around
        2,700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2010, representing around 17% of global
        emissions. Of this total, approximately 40% (800 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent)
        relates to energy use in the production process. Several actions can be taken to reduce these
        emissions such as:
        •	 Improvements in energy efficiency               •	 Better technology
        •	 Higher quality inputs                           •	 Fuel switching

        The calcination reaction emissions, accountable for nearly 50% of the total emissions, are
        unavoidable due to the chemical composition of the materials and the production process
        reaction. Although, improved material efficiency may be an option, the main way in which these
        emissions could be reduced is through reduced demand, for example resulting from innovative
        products as an alternative to standard cement.

        The remaining 10% of the GHG emissions come from the pre-processing and transportation of
        the raw materials and finished product. These are therefore often embedded within the product’s
        supply chain. The majority of cement kilns burn coal, but it is also possible to use alternative fuels
        such as biomass wastes, which can decrease GHG emissions.

Opportunities in the iron and steel sector
The global iron and steel industry GHG emissions were around 2,600 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent in 2010. The sector is very energy intensive, the production requires significant
heat and power, but also has significant variability by technology and region.

Many energy efficiency opportunities exist, including:
•	 Improving heat and energy recovery from process gases, products and waste streams
•	 Improving fuel delivery through pulverized coal injection
•	 Improving furnace designs
•	 Improving process controls
•	 Reducing the number of temperature cycles through better process coupling
•	 Using energy efficient technologies
•	 Applying coke dry quenching techniques
•	 Using top pressure recovery turbines

     Since the mid-19th century, industrial GHG emissions have been on the increase, a trend that has
     become more significant in recent decades (Table 2). Industry’s GHG emissions have grown from
     10.4 GtCO2e (giga-tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) in 1990 to 15.4 GtCO2e in 2010, and
     currently contribute around 30% of global GHG emissions.

     Since the beginning of the current century, GHG emission growth has been particularly strong in
     Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East25. Most of these economies are in their early stages of
     industrial development, and with increasing market activities, the trajectory of strong emission
     growth will last in these regions if no immediate actions are taken.

Climate variability and resource scarcity are jeopardizing the competitiveness of more vulnerable
economies, and posing increasing challenges to the growth of the manufacturing sector. In
response, governments and industries must find ways to tackle this challenge together, while
also taking advantage of the opportunities presented by cleaner technologies and more efficient
processes.

Yet despite the importance of resource efficiency to economic development, it is rarely seen as
a priority. In developing countries in particular, resource efficiency faces a number of barriers,
including a lack of clear and stable policy, a lack of information on best practices, and limited
access to investment finance.

     The World Bank Group’s Climate Competitive Industries (CCI) initiative aims to assist emerging
     economies in improving the competitiveness of their manufacturing industry by facilitating the
     implementation of more efficient practices that are tailored to the needs of the private sector. The
     CCI initiative advises client governments on how to accomplish this, and targets the following
     market challenges to promote green competitiveness:
     •	 Increasing resource scarcity and risk: Industries are becoming less competitive due to
        increasing resource scarcity coupled with high and volatile energy costs, causing shocks in the
        market.
     •	 The need for prioritized and private sector oriented responses: Governments, which are
        pivotal in promoting resource efficiency, need tools to prioritize practical energy and water
        saving opportunities for their key industries.
     •	 Information asymmetry for investors: Informational barriers slow the ability of companies
        to react to resource and price shocks, and take advantage of market-based opportunities.
     •	 Prioritization challenge: Coordination failures and limited access to information among
        private sector firms, governments, civil society and other institutions have prevented uptake of
        profitable investment opportunities in resource efficiency.
     •	 Much needed global effort: Uncertainty in global climate negotiations causing companies in
        developing counties to decelerate the rate of adoption of the most efficient technologies.

     The CCI initiative responds to market failures by providing policymakers with solutions to reduce
     the use of energy and water, and the production of waste in manufacturing processes, while
     reducing the sector’s operating costs and risk profile. As part of a comprehensive solution the
     initiative focuses on four integrated solutions as illustrated below.

four solutions for a given target beneficiary. To identify those solutions, CCI establishes strategic
dialogue platforms to engage with various stakeholders ranging from governments to the private
sector, from local industrial associations to NGOs.

     5.	 Stimulating climate competitive industry

     The growth of climate competitive industry is best led by the private sector and supported by
     government through the creation of stable and predictable enabling conditions. There is a diverse
     range of actions that governments (national or local) can undertake to accelerate the transition
     to resource efficient industry, and therefore governments have an important role to play in the
     development and implementation of climate competitive industry programs.

     Governments need to ensure that policies and incentives promote efficient behavior and decision
     making by industry and address barriers to uptake27. In cases where industry is not adopting
     resource efficient practices, then regulations, incentives and support mechanisms provided by
     government can motivate companies to implement better resource management.

     There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ tool applicable across all sectors, countries and company types, and
     therefore the tools most suitable to a particular context must be carefully selected. There are a
     number of approaches that government can adopt to facilitate resource efficient industry, either
     on their own, or integrated with one another. These normally can be separated into four core
     categories11 28 (Figure 4):
     •	 Research and development: developing, gathering and disseminating information.
        Government, or independent bodies set up or recruited by government, can act as an
        effective contact point for industry actors wishing to learn more about efficient processes or
        technologies. Industry trade associations are often well placed to take on this role, but may
        lack sufficient resources.
     •	 Policy and regulation: high-level policy goals and statements of intent can give firms
        confidence in a government’s long-term support for efficiency investments. Regulation, such as
        compulsory technological standards or the ban of specific methods or materials, may also be
        necessary. However, there can be a risk of stifling innovation if businesses are driven to adopt
        one particular solution.

•	 Financing mechanisms: measures that use market mechanism to provide incentives for desired
   behaviors. This includes fiscal incentives such as loans or grants, but also levies that seek to
   incorporate the external costs of a product or service into its price (e.g. carbon taxes). It also
   includes the creation of property rights and proxy markets for the use of environmental services
   (e.g. emissions trading). Market-based measures afford businesses flexibility to innovate in
   finding the most cost-effective solutions for their particular circumstances (see box).
•	 Standards and labelling: involving private enterprises in the development of appropriate
   standards and labelling schemes, e.g. through trade bodies or chambers of commerce. For
   governments, this could mean stepping aside and letting industry take the lead, or providing a
   framework or benchmarks for those that wish to participate in a voluntary initiative.

         Case study 2: Successful market-based measures in Thailand

         In the early 1990s Thailand identified energy conservation as a low-cost pathway to addressing
         rising energy demand. The 1992 Energy Conservation Promotion Act established energy
         efficiency requirements for industry and created an Energy Conservation Promotion Fund
         (ECPF), financed by a dedicated sales tax levied on petroleum products.

         In 2002 the government used funds from the ECPF to establish an Energy Efficiency Revolving
         Fund (EERF) to provide credit lines to local banks that would then provide loans at fixed low
         interest rates for energy efficiency projects in industry. The initiative started with six banks and
         has expanded to eleven; meanwhile the banks involved have gained sufficient familiarity with
         energy efficiency projects to take on more of the financing cost with fewer concessions.

         By 2010, the revolving fund had financed 335 energy efficiency projects and 112 renewable
         energy projects, with a total investment of $453 million. The estimated annual energy cost
         savings were $154 million, with an average payback of around three years. By 2012, every
         dollar committed by the ECPF helped mobilize an estimated two dollars from other investors29.

These interventions can be more effective when used in combination, and the synergies that
exist between them should be exploited. For example, if minimum standards are adopted that
proscribe the purchase of an inefficient boiler type, a low-interest loan to purchase a compliant,
but costlier replacement boiler will help bring forward replacement and promote compliance with
the regulations.

The impact of interventions will be determined to some extent by the size of the enterprise in
question (Figure 5). It will often be SMEs where there is greatest potential for efficiency savings,
due to the specific barriers they face. Five key government support mechanisms have been found
successfully to encourage resource efficiency amongst SMEs21:
•	 Financial assistance. Public subsidies and soft loans are particularly effective in the case of
   SMEs, which will often lack access to capital for investment in efficiency improvements;
•	 Investment assistance. Easy-to-use instructions and standards for steps in the investment
   process;
•	 Technical assistance. Product and service delivery to an appropriate standard. SMEs may be
   confronted by a range of claims made by suppliers and service providers. This may encourage
   complacency due to conflicting messages and a lack of confidence in the ability of suppliers
   and service providers to deliver consistent outcomes;
•	 Policy stability and consistent messaging. Efficiency improvement can be maximized
   through consistent communication of the business case for efficient industry, using multiple
   channels including across multiple government departments and industry associations.
   Developments in policy should support and reflect this consistent messaging;
•	 Networks and fora for exchange of knowledge. Interactions within and between
   policymakers and practitioners can be particularly constructive in providing new perspectives
   on effective policymaking and program implementation. Participants can share successful
   practices and explore solutions to challenging policy and program implementation issues.

     A diverse policy and regulatory mix, that specifically targets SMEs, should be used to help
     leverage opportunities for improvement. These government actions can be more effective when
     they target specific phases in the business life cycle, for example, when SMEs replace existing
     equipment, when they develop budgets, and when they conduct business planning.

     To ensure the success of any new measure, it will be critical to understand what institutions are
     present within the country and the extent to which any existing measures have already been
     adopted (see Module 2: Sub-step 2.2: Assessing the regulatory and institutional context). If there
     is potential to be exploited, then this should be a key objective of any meeting with government
     authorities.

     With these interventions, governments provide a variety of benefits for the private sector, such
     as enhanced competitiveness through cost reductions, new business opportunities, better
     environmental compliance, health benefits through better local air and water quality, better work
     conditions, and reduced waste, all of which provide multiple indirect private and social benefits.24

     The box below summarizes an analysis of energy efficiency programs in the pulp and paper
     industry sector. Barriers were identified and policy recommendations made that involved both
     private and public sector actions, similar to a CCI program. Cooperation between the public and
     private sector was found to be fundamental to improving efficiency within the sector and key to
     building the foundations of a robust low-carbon economy at a city, state and national level.




        Case study 3: Energy efficiency in pulp and paper mills

        In 2013, the World Resources Institute published a report30 highlighting the role of energy
        efficiency programs in improving the performance of pulp and paper mills. It was found that
        inefficient facilities had a high potential to achieve cost savings and decrease GHG emissions.
        Significant savings could be achieved by investing in initiatives that had the aim of driving
        these facilities to achieve the average U.S. energy efficiency level. In order to achieve this,
        many barriers had to be understood, analyzed and overcome. The main challenges for the
        less efficient pulp and paper mills were:
        •	 Prohibitive costs for project financing
        •	 Limited information about energy efficiency opportunities
        •	 Inconsistent or non-existent regulations
        •	 Technical obstacles
        •	 Prolonged investment cycles and
        •	 Slow capital turnover rates

These barriers have to be overcome through different actions, from the direct support
of financial institutions and energy efficiency investment programs to energy efficiency
awareness.

Energy-related capital investments are frequently perceived as risky due to the uncertain
and volatile economy, lack of governmental support and energy market conditions.

Information/awareness barriers were found to be very common amongst industry leaders,
as they often were unaware of the existing opportunities, technologies and processes
available to implement energy efficiency practices. Misconception of the energy efficiency
potential was also a barrier that was identified in this sector.

Business understood the need to comply with environmental regulations, but did not
always appreciate the potential financial benefit of implementing energy efficiency
programs that would also assist with compliance.

Due to the slow capital turnover rates typical within the pulp and paper industry it was
noted that new policies, programs and incentives were needed to help the sector to
exploit energy efficiency measures where possible.

This research identified how certain barriers could not be overcome without government
support. The pulp and paper industry sector needed to work with governments to enable
policies and programs that help create awareness, and develop financial and technical
programs which aid efficiency actions in the sector. Industry-led action is needed at a local,
state and national level, to achieve sustainable results.

The report recommended actions including:
•	 Periodic benchmark industrial energy efficiency performance reviews
•	 Support of combined heat and power use though state and national policies
•	 New regulatory frameworks to promote electric utility-manufacturer collaboration
•	 Building on current research to develop geographically and sectoral integrated climate

     	        Planning an engagement strategy

     There are certain key pieces of information that a practitioner should gather prior to an initial
     meeting with the client. This section provides practitioners with a clear idea of what they need to
     know to ensure they are able to make the most of their first engagement with the client. It will also
     help them to ensure that their time is used effectively, by providing guidance on how to identify the
     relevant local actors, and how to outline the case for why these stakeholders should be interested in
     a particular project or program.

Sub-step 1.1: Researching the context
It is important for a practitioner to gain a preliminary understanding of the local context and the
potential for an industrial efficiency program prior to first visiting the client. This section outlines
what a practitioner should research and what information they will need at their fingertips
when in discussion with relevant stakeholders. Once a practitioner has made first contact it can
be agreed with the client whether a more in-depth scoping study is necessary (see Step Two:
Conducting a diagnostic study).

The policy and regulatory context can provide the right enabling conditions for the development
of climate competitive industry. By examining the key policies and instruments in this area the
practitioner will gain an understanding of what action is being taken, what is motivating that
action, and who the main stakeholders are.
1.	 What are the main energy and resource consuming sectors and processes? Undertake
    research to identify the key industrial sectors and processes operating in the country or region
    and understand their current status and issues relevant to resource efficiency.
2.	 What action has been taken on industrial efficiency? Including relevant policies,
    frameworks and legislation. One useful source of information on industrial efficiency policies is
    the Industrial Efficiency Policy Database31.
3.	 What are the main policies governing industrial development? A useful database of
    national development strategies and as well as industry development policies is maintained by
    the United Nations Economic and Social Council32.
4.	 What action has been taken on climate change? For example, does the country have
    any national GHG emission targets? If the country has submitted an Intended Nationally
    Determined Contribution (INDC), then it can be found on the UNFCCC website33. Analysis of
    national actions and commitments on climate change can be found on the Climate Action
    Tracker website34.
5.	 What is the state of the energy market? What is the price of energy? Who are the principal
    stakeholders (i.e. utility firms, energy consumers, regulators, government ministries, etc.)? Are
    there issues regarding security of supply?

     Narrowing down the focus of areas for potential investment will come after meeting with the
     stakeholders concerned. However, even before that has happened, by looking at programs in the
     geographic region, or in countries with a similar economic profile, it will be possible to get an
     initial idea of the areas on which it might be appropriate to focus.

     One way of doing this is to investigate previous investment or advisory programs. It is important that
     any new work builds on, and has synergies with, any other current or previous programs carried out
     in-country. Furthermore, the practitioner should identify any research into the investment potential
     of industrial energy efficiency within the country, region, or other relevant area.

     Examining the conclusions and evaluations of previous similar programs will provide the
     practitioner with a quick initial assessment of the barriers likely to be faced, as well as potential
     routes to avoid these obstacles. If possible, contact relevant program managers with the aim
     of discussing any issues experienced, including those highlighted by any program evaluation
     work. Investigate whether there are any cultural issues that should be taken into account when
     approaching contacts in-country.

     Sub-step 1.2: Meeting with the client
     The first stage of the engagement will be some form of inception meeting with the client.
     Depending on the particular circumstances, the client might be an industrial trade body, chamber
     of commerce, government department, local government authority, or regional development
     body. Use this initial meeting to discuss the objectives and scope of a potential program, and
     to create an outline work plan including details of the next steps, task allocation and a plan for
     stakeholder engagement.

     Establishing clear objectives for the first meeting will enable the practitioner and client to prepare
     for the meeting, reducing the time and effort involved on the day. The main outcome of the
     initial meeting should be the client’s agreement on the likely objectives and scope of a program.
     However, there will be a range of other things the practitioner will want to take away from the
     meeting and therefore it is essential to define the objectives of the meeting in advance.

At this stage, the following preliminary details are essential:
1.	 The client’s goals: What are the client’s goals in seeking improved resource efficiency?
    Identify the driving forces behind their interest. This will dictate much of the design of
    the program, not least the selection of the program’s target segment(s) and opportunities
    for investment. The client may have a very clear idea of the path they wish to pursue;
    equally, they may have no preconceptions and will require an in-depth diagnostic study
    to understand where the most appropriate opportunities lie. The practitioner will need
    to establish whether there is an interest in particular technologies, and whether costed
    opportunities have already been identified.
2.	Funding: Dependent on the focus of the program, it may be possible to obtain an
    understanding of the scale and types of funding that might be accessible to the program
    from government sources.
3.	 Information and data: Consider what sort of secondary information is available and
    whether an in-depth scoping study is necessary? What is known about the market,
    institutional capacity and current efficiency for any potential opportunity? The client should
    be well placed to provide a practitioner with relevant details and documents concerning
    these critical success factors. Particularly if the client is a government body, they may also be
    able to provide details of the existing regulatory context and the barriers faced in program
    implementation in this area.
4.	Stakeholders: Work with the client to identify all the stakeholders who are likely to be
    affected, as well as those who have an interest in moving the work forward – can they
    provide a complete list? The next section, Sub-step 1.3: Planning stakeholder engagement,
    provides guidance on how to approach these actors.
5.	Ambition: The development of high-level aims, objectives and targets that are specific,
    measurable, ambitious, realistic and time-bound (SMART).
6.	Timeline: Plan out the initial scoping tasks, including further meetings with the client and
    with stakeholders individually or collectively, perhaps in the form of a workshop.
7.	 Communication with the client: In order to monitor the evolution of the program, ensure
    there is provision for regular contact with the client, to report on progress and interim
    outputs, and to provide a forum to discuss program developments, anticipated difficulties
    and proposed solutions in a timely manner.

     Sub-step 1.3: Planning stakeholder engagement
     Stakeholder buy-in is a fundamental requirement of implementing a successful resource efficiency
     program. Engaged stakeholders will validate, support and even drive forward the implementation
     process. This section provides guidance on identifying the stakeholders relevant to a successful
     program, and explains how to plan and manage effective stakeholder consultation with individual
     stakeholder groups.

     Stakeholder engagement should be an ongoing process, which starts in the concept phase, and
     continues throughout program development and into the implementation phase. Consultations
     at this early phase of the program should aim to give the stakeholders a sense of ownership
     of the initiative and provide a forum for the development of a consensus on the driving forces
     of industrial efficiency, the barriers to implementation, and the factors that will be critical to
     the program’s success. This process will begin to forge partnerships between actors, which will
     eventually facilitate the development of transparent, relevant and achievable objectives that meet
     the needs of industry and the client.

     Identify the stakeholders
     At the outset of the process all relevant stakeholders should be identified. Involving the client and
     other stakeholders in the process should broaden a practitioner’s understanding of the key players
     and lower the risk of overlooking an important stakeholder. To help frame the identification
     process, stakeholders can be categorized into three groups36:
     •	 public sector stakeholders consist of government entities that could be responsible for
        underpinning the program by introducing relevant policies, regulations, fiscal incentives
        or penalty mechanisms. These stakeholders can also be critical to the creation of strategic
        dialogue platforms that can facilitate the interaction of the various stakeholders concerned.
        Public sector stakeholders in this context are typically ministries of finance, industry, commerce,
        planning, energy and the environment, as well as local authorities and industrial zone
        authorities. However, they may also include the managing agencies of any existing energy
        programs/funds; energy regulatory commissions, cleaner production centers, energy efficiency
        centers, standards and metrology organizations, and development partners (e.g. active
        agencies such as GEF, UNIDO, ADB, GIZ, JICA, DANIDA etc.).
     •	 private sector stakeholders are the implementers and beneficiaries of efficiency projects.
        They include industrial enterprises, industry and trade associations, chambers of commerce
        and industry, banks and financial institutions, accountants, utility providers, equipment
        manufacturers and vendors, installers, ESCOs, energy and resource efficiency consultants and
        legal experts;
     •	 community stakeholders can include local communities, educators, researchers and NGOs
        who would benefit from greater industrial efficiency, or a cleaner environment, as well as the
        spill-over benefits of new knowledge and skills. They can play an important role in ensuring
        that the local communities also benefit from a resource efficiency program.

     Ultimately, the appropriate stakeholders for a program will depend on the target industry(s) and/
     or technologies, the size range of target companies, and the nature and scale of the program
     interventions chosen. For example, Figure 6 illustrates the key stakeholders identified for SMEs, by
     members of a platform for strategic dialogue in Australia.

     Map the stakeholders
     Once stakeholders have been identified, the practitioner should conduct a stakeholder mapping
     exercise to gain an understanding of the political, economic and social impact of the prospective
     program on the interested parties. The process will help the practitioner to summarize the power
     dynamics and perceptions that govern the relationships between the stakeholders. Figure 7 takes
     the practitioner through the questions that determine the ability of individual stakeholders to
     either hinder or enhance a new initiative36. The outcome from the exercise can be illustrated in a
     matrix as shown in Figure 8.

           3 DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM                 4 IMPLEMENTATION   67
     Stakeholder mapping should be conducted following direct consultation with stakeholders in
     order to get the most out of the process. Use the process to evaluate the program objectives
     alongside the goals of the other stakeholders, in particular38:
     •	 The goals of private financiers: Ascertain who local financiers are targeting in order to
        develop new customers or business lines (e.g. industry, SMEs etc.). Designing the program to
        dovetail with their efforts could improve the chances of success. For example, are there any
        existing targeted loan programs that the program could complement?
     •	 The goals of other investors: Government authorities and other international donors may
        have specific goals that drive the direction of their program interests. For example, are there
        any ongoing technology promotion programs that could provide a gateway into the market,
        or which might conflict with any new program?

     Reaching out to stakeholders will allow the practitioner to identify and assess their goals, ensuring
     that where beneficial the program aligns with the stakeholders’ objectives.

     Public sector stakeholders
     This section looks at the typical interests of government authorities, and provides details on how a
     CCI or similar intervention might align with their goals.

     Owing to the complex nature of industrial efficiency initiatives, government support, in the
     form of clear policy statements, regulation or incentives, is often a requirement of a successful
     program. Resource efficient industry programs are most successful where there is strong
     commitment and leadership from prominent agencies within the government (e.g. the prime
     minister’s office, finance ministers, economic development ministers etc.), backed up by broader
     support throughout the public sector. The need to incorporate a diverse range of actors may also
     rely upon access to government connections and endorsement.

     The support of local authorities can also be critical to a program’s success. Local authorities
     are the main providers of key services, such as water supply, waste removal, and in some cases
     electricity, and local governments themselves will benefit from any resource efficiency initiatives.

For these reasons, it is likely that the first contact a practitioner will make is with government
authorities, either at the national or at the regional or local level. By harnessing political resolve
and adequate governmental support, the practitioner can raise the profile of their program, gain
local credibility, and extend the reach of the program.

The first step is to consider which elements of government (at all levels) would be best to act
as a local counterpart. To be successful the practitioner will need to gain a good knowledge
of the existing capacities of authorities and institutions within the country. This will require the
identification and mapping of stakeholders as described earlier in this chapter.

When approaching any government department, think in advance about their aims and objectives
and how these can be supported and complemented by growth in resource efficient industry.
Four main factors drive government to support industrial efficiency initiatives, and the relative
importance of these will vary depending on the specific country’s circumstances – see Figure 9.

Private sector stakeholders
In the context of industrial resource efficiency, industrial enterprises and financiers are typically the
key stakeholders, and it is critical that the incentives for both parties are communicated clearly from
the start of the process. This section looks at how resource efficiency can align with their interests.

Financial institutions may be a vital conduit for overcoming the lack of access to finance faced by firms
in emerging economies. Donors and governments can help overcome this problem by establishing
dedicated credit lines that allow financial institutions (often local banks) to on-lend funds to entities
wishing, for example, to improve their energy efficiency. The success of a credit line depends largely
on the selection of competent and committed financial institutions. A technical assistance component
built into the credit line also helps lower the technical and thus financial risk of projects.

Sector associations are critical points of contact for a practitioner working with industry. It is
important to note that previous work by international donors may, in some cases, have fostered
an environment which is hostile to outside intervention (e.g. because of unfulfilled promises or
unsuccessful projects). Furthermore, a practitioner may find that local companies believe that
providing detailed business or market information could put them at a disadvantage. These factors
highlight the need for early engagement and the use of strategic dialogue platforms throughout the
duration of the program.

The adoption of efficient practices by industry is typically driven by the potential for cost reduction.
However, as described in Module 2, there are a number of other benefits to industry, such as
enhanced productivity and competitiveness, and reduced exposure to volatile energy and raw
material prices.

To improve the chance of successful outreach with these parties:
1.	 Research examples of successful projects using the specific program model selected.
    This will be critical in gaining buy-in during market outreach. These serve the purpose of providing
    clarity on the potential products on offer, and increasing confidence amongst the parties. The
    creation of a short-term pilot scheme can also have the same benefits.
2.	 Include local financiers and technical experts from the outset. This will help ensure
    financiers are interested in the chosen program, demonstrate to the client that they are supportive
    of the program, and begin the conversation about the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
    threats concerning potential institutional partnerships.

     Community stakeholders
     For most industrial resource efficiency programs there are likely to be few, if any, relevant
     community stakeholders. Nevertheless, the practitioner should consider whether there could be
     any impacts, positive or negative, on community interests from an anticipated program. Impacts
     and the need for community involvement are likely to arise where larger infrastructure type
     projects are supported by the program, such as renewable power generation, district heating,
     waste handling/recycling facilities, etc.

     Implementing organization and program advisory committee
     The initial consultation activities should aim to establish the stakeholders’ commitment to the
     program and their potential roles in its development. Figure10 illustrates the types of typical
     stakeholders that might be involved in an energy program.

It is important to consider the different ways in which the implementation and the ongoing
operation of the program could be managed. It is likely that a single organization will take
responsibility for leading the implementation of the program. Depending on the nature of the
program, this organization could be a government ministry, an existing agency, trade body,
other NGO, or even a private contractor. A single implementing body provides clarity, but such
an approach needs to ensure that the ‘ownership’ and responsibilities of other stakeholders are
maintained and, where appropriate, formalized. It is important that clear governance structures
and accountabilities are established for the design, implementation, operation, and eventual
monitoring and evaluation of the program (see Sub-step 3.4: Establishing a framework for
monitoring and evaluation).

Whether an advisory group or committee is necessary for the program should be considered:
•	 Will the program connect multiple stakeholders of similar relative importance? An
   advisory group can help provide a platform for the exchange of ideas, where there is not
   already a relevant platform in existence.
•	 Are there important stakeholders that cannot be involved directly in the design and
   management of the program due to conflicts of interest? It may be the case that it would
   be inappropriate for certain stakeholders to have a role beyond providing advice and views; having
   them as members of an advisory group may be a suitable way of ensuring their involvement.
•	 Is the program sufficiently important to government authorities? Government authorities
   may not be sufficiently interested to commit the resources towards supporting an ongoing
   advisory group.
•	 Is the active support and involvement from the practitioner’s senior management
   necessary in order to convene the stakeholders? Consider whether the involvement of
   senior staff may have a bearing on the program, and whether the cost-benefit is worthwhile.
•	 How long is the program expected to last? It may not be cost-effective to organize a
   leadership group if the program timescale is short.

If an advisory group or similar is to be established, some key factors should be considered to
optimize the process. Foremost is that all parties should be brought together from the outset of
the program, to ensure any conflicts are immediately understood and managed so as to reduce
the risk of later problems. Once the stakeholders are together, seek to ensure that the highest-
level stakeholders clearly voice their approval of the program. This will enhance the credibility of
the program to other stakeholders and help ensure their cooperation.

        Case study 4: The China Utility-based Energy Efficiency (CHUEE) Program

        The CHUEE Program41 Advisory Committee (PAC) provides an example of stakeholder
        collaboration that succeeded in advancing China’s energy efficiency sector. Stakeholder meetings
        have been held annually since 2007, providing a platform for all stakeholders to contribute to the
        ongoing success of the program. The program required the close collaboration of stakeholders
        including government, banks, donors, market players, as well as the IFC.

        Three lessons can be learned from the program.
        1.	 Coordinate all parties together from the beginning. The buy-in and participation of
            multiple supervisory governmental departments was critical to the program’s success. The
            program team had to secure consistent consent from authorities as varied as the Ministry
            of Finance (MOF), National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China Banking
            Regulatory Commission (CBRC), State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and
            the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP). These authorities did not always have
            synchronized interests and early engagement made this process possible. The solution
            was to set up a Program Advisory Committee (PAC), staffed by a representative from
            each stakeholder organization. This ensured a strategic dialogue platform to assess the
            program’s development and discuss its future direction.
        2.	 Encourage the highest-level stakeholders to voice clearly their approval of the
            program. At the first PAC meeting the IFC ensured that the most senior representatives of
            the bodies represented affirmed their support of and commitment to the program. The
            team found that this process precipitated cooperation within the government authorities
            and strengthened the program’s profile when approaching banks.
        3.	 Once the committee has been established, continue the momentum allowing the
            expansion of the program and its influence. The program team scheduled annual advisory
            committee meetings in order to share experiences and expand the scope of the program,
            and review how to further publicize and duplicate the success of the program. Successive
            meetings led to suggestions that were beneficially adopted by the program, such as
            raising the loan ceiling and expanding the pool of loss-sharing with the bank.

Should it be decided that there will be no advisory committee, decide who will coordinate inter-
agency communication. It is essential that the practitioner and the client agree who will take
responsibility for actions such as negotiating with stakeholders to reach agreement on how best
to develop the program, deciding on stakeholder roles within the program and the factors that
are expected to affect them in the future.

Form a sustainability dialogue platform
It is increasingly recognized that the private sector can play an important role in generating viable
solutions to the challenges faced by government. One of the most effective ways of delivering a
sustainable improvement within the industry sector is to improve the effectiveness of public-private
dialogue and advocacy. Promoting inclusive dialogue allows local actors to set their own reform
priorities and identify solutions that they support. This should assist in the design of policies and
programs that are more credible and acceptable to the private sector.

Sustainability dialogue platforms (SDPs) connect public and private stakeholders, providing a
structured, participatory and inclusive approach to policymaking. SDPs can address issues at
local, national, or international levels, and be organized by industry sector, cluster or value chain.
They can also be time-bound (established to solve a particular set of issues) or institutionalized
for in-depth transformation and development42. Practitioners can use SDPs to bring together
stakeholders for the successful design and implementation of a climate competitive industry
program.

In the context of resource efficiency policy-making, the inclusion of stakeholders in a sustainability
dialogue platform can have the following key benefits:

•	   Policy decisions are more effective as they are based on evidence from stakeholders;
•	   Development of regulations is more responsive to feedback;
•	   Policy has credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders;
•	   Industry buy-in results in sustainable reform.

   Sustainability Reporting and Efficiency Improvement
   Sustainability reporting (also referred to as social reporting, corporate responsibility reporting,
   Environmental, Social & Corporate Governance (ESG) reporting and non-financial reporting)
   has become an established component of communication to stakeholders that complements
   financial reporting by leading companies. Such reporting has emerged as part of a trend
   toward increasing transparency and accountability on environmental and social performance.
   Reports serve to communicate to multiple audiences a company’s corporate citizenship
   efforts in areas including community involvement, environmental impact, philanthropy
   and governance. In some cases, firms incorporate voluntary sustainability reporting in their
   mandatory financial reports.

   In addition to the value of issuing social reports, companies can derive internal and external
   benefits from the reporting process. It can help to inform strategy and culture, establish
   accountability, provide transparency, stimulate dialogue with stakeholders, and engage
   employees across the organization in advancing corporate social responsibility. Sustainability
   reports are written with various stakeholders in mind, including investors, employees, senior
   managers, customers, community organizations, as well as award ranking and recognition
   entities. Producing a social report is increasingly standard practice43.

     Develop a communication plan strategy
     An effective engagement strategy will be critical to ensuring stakeholder buy-in as well as making
     the most of stakeholder time and input.

     The first step in the engagement of multiple stakeholders might be the development of a
     communication and outreach strategy. The key steps in creating a strong communication strategy
     are outlined in Figure 11.

     FIGURE 11       Steps involved in creating a communication plan

80                      1 URGENCY                                   2 CONCEPT AND DESIGN
Establishing the goals of the communication plan is the first and most important step. An
outreach program will have a better chance of success if the objectives are:
•	 clear and specific;
•	 time-bound;
•	 measurable.

The goals of the communication plan will determine the audience. Before deciding what to
communicate, it is important to step back and listen to the target audience’s interests and
concerns. Conversations with members of the intended audience (e.g. a sector association
representative), over the telephone or in person, will allow a practitioner to gain a more in-depth
understanding of their feelings and beliefs.

Choosing the appropriate spokesperson for a communications campaign should depend on
the message to be conveyed as well as the audience. A practitioner should avoid selecting a
messenger before they know the audience and message to be communicated. Information is
typically more credible when it comes from people directly affected by an issue, for example, an
enterprise may be more receptive to advice from an industry body, than if it were delivered by a
public official. The credibility of the messenger is just as important as the message itself.

Presentation of the message is another important consideration. Summary fact sheets, detailing
the aim of the program and the potential benefits, are a useful way to communicate key
information. These must be honed to the information that will have the greatest impact on
stakeholders. A practitioner should ensure the information they are providing is accurate and is
provided in context, to avoid issues of trust later on. Developing a fact sheet for the program can
also be a useful reference point, ensuring all stakeholders stay on message when talking with one
another or with media and other interested parties.

The message should be delivered in a format that provides the basic template for all future
communications. The style should be concise, clear and compelling, and the content should:
•	 give the target audience a reason to care about the issue by appealing to their values and
   immediate concerns;
•	 describe the issue, its root causes, and why it is relevant to the given stakeholders;
•	 provide a solution that will allow them to respond to the issue.

     Depending on the scale of the program and the degree of outreach required, a practitioner may
     wish to measure the results and analyze the effectiveness of their communication strategy using
     indicators such as:
     •	 participant feedback from meetings, programs, and events;
     •	 survey of target audiences;
     •	 content of media coverage.

     The next step in engagement may be a meeting, workshop or even an audit or site visit. Again,
     organizing preliminary telephone calls with stakeholders, either in the form of formal interviews
     or informal discussions, can be a useful method of gathering preliminary details to set a relevant
     agenda for future face-to-face meetings.

     Consultation workshops are a transparent and effective way of incorporating stakeholder ideas
     and viewpoints into the program design process. If the practitioner and the client decide that
     workshops would play a useful role in the engagement process, there are certain things that
     should be decided as early as possible:
     •	 How many workshops will be needed? The number and duration of workshops will be
        dictated by various factors, not least the program budget, and therefore a practitioner may not
        know this at the outset. However, it can be useful to look at similar programs to gauge what
        might be expected;
     •	 Who will attend the meeting? Work with the client to decide which of the stakeholders
        identified would be required at which meeting. Will each stakeholder be required for each
        meeting? Do any stakeholders need financial assistance to attend?
     •	 When should they take place? This is not just a question of when is suitable for the program
        timetable. Think about factors that might prevent stakeholders from attending, e.g. whether
        there are busy periods within the industry or cultural events that would limit attendance? Also,
        identify those key stakeholders without whom the consultation should be postponed.
     •	 Where should they take place? The location of the workshop may prohibit attendance
        by some stakeholders due to the cost of travel. Is there budget to support travel and
        accommodation for attendees? Think also about the cost and appropriateness of possible
        venues. Which, if any, venues have been used in the past and how was the experience?




82                       1 URGENCY                                   2 CONCEPT AND DESIGN
•	 Who will organize the meeting? There may be multiple actors involved in program
   leadership. Is there a consultant managing the program, or is it more appropriate for the client
   or the practitioner’s program team to set the agenda and lead the meeting? Who is covering
   the cost of the meeting?
•	 What is the aim of the workshop? Usually the aim will be to bring to the surface any
   potential challenges to take into account while designing the program (e.g. absence of
   testing facilities for standards and labelling, cost of implementation, lack of access to or
   understanding of the required technology, lack of affordability for end customers, lack
   of necessary institutional capacity or support etc.). However, the workshop can also be
   used to increase awareness of the opportunities presented by resource efficiency amongst
   stakeholders. Think about exercises that could help this goal; for example, asking stakeholders
   to list the long-term benefits or export opportunities presented by efficiency measures.
•	 How will it be structured?
   The program team should begin by
   presenting their initial thinking with
   respect to implementation options;
   however, the meeting should afford
   stakeholders the opportunity to
   comment. The structure must be
   setup to allow discussion, e.g. a
   roundtable format with question
   and answer sessions and with a
   detailed agenda provided in advance.
   Consider how stakeholder views will
   be captured and documented; e.g.,
   will there be someone to record the
   meeting? Factor in time to probe the
   rationale behind any issues identified,
   as and when they come up, as well
   as to examine potential remedial
   actions. Summarizing the discussion
   at the end will give the stakeholders
   assurance that their perspectives are
   being taken into account.

     8.	 Step Two:
     	   Conducting a diagnostic study

     The potential for efficiency savings, and therefore financial savings, is the primary criterion
     for assessing whether an investment in clean technology is worthwhile. However, in order
     to understand what savings are possible, a practitioner will need to assess existing market
     conditions, the maturity of the target industries, underlying institutional structures and
     capabilities, and the regulatory framework within the country. These factors will all have a bearing
     on the success of the program.

     In some circumstances, the case for an investment may already have been made, and the
     advantages may be well understood. However, often it will be beneficial to conduct an in-depth
     diagnostic study at the initial stages of program scoping, for example, where there is a lack of
     information or raw data, where SMEs are involved, or where there is a need for a comprehensive
     large-scale program.

     An in-depth diagnostic will allow the practitioner to target the opportunities that show the
     greatest impact from a range of potential options, and will help in understanding the subsequent
     performance of any action taken.

     This section provides information on what to take into account when conducting an in-depth
     diagnostic study at the initial stages of program scoping. Based on the findings of the diagnostic
     study, the practitioner should produce a development plan for the program. This should include a
     detailed and pragmatic work plan that identifies the activities to be undertaken in terms of type,
     duration, dates, targets, resource requirements, and timeframe.

  Sub-steps
  Sub-step 2.1:
  Assessing the market

  Sub-step 2.2:
  Assessing the regulatory and institutional context

  Sub-step 2.3:
  Assessing existing resource use and efficiency opportunities



Sub-step 2.1: Assessing the market
Market analysis is the first step to providing a high-level diagnostic of the impact of more efficient
technologies in a given market. Carrying out a market analysis will provide the practitioner with
an understanding of the existing market structure, and will allow them to select a target market
based on the potential for impact.

A market analysis involves the identification of market and stock data, market trends, consumer
prices, available technologies (including data on energy performance) and investment cost data.
The approach taken to the resulting program will be dictated by market selection, and therefore
it is critical that a robust market analysis precedes program design. For example, different types of
technical expertise and institutional connections will be relevant to different programs.

The first step is to establish whether there is detailed knowledge of efficiency potential within
the target sector, for example is information available through recent audit programs? Where
information is missing for specific equipment, or within particular industries, resource efficiency
audits can be undertaken directly to support the project (see Sub-step 2.3: Assessing existing
resource use and efficiency opportunities).

     The most thorough approach to selecting a target market would be to conduct a macro-
     level review of the overall market, to identify the areas with the greatest potential for cost-
     effective resource efficiency. This would include a detailed assessment of the national context,
     including the current state of resource consumption, the drivers of consumption, as well as any
     future trends and their impact on the economy and environment. It should also focus on the
     industrial context, outlining the economic importance of the sector, its constituents (e.g. metals,
     textiles, chemicals etc.), and their relative share in consumption. This analysis should elucidate
     the distribution of manufacturing within the country, the orientation of the market towards
     technologically efficient equipment and the potential scale for increased exportation of products.

However, a complete systematic review may not be practical given time and cost constraints. If
the practitioner or key stakeholders already have in mind potential projects that are likely to be
a success, then a targeted review of the market for technologies with the greatest potential,
combined with a review of the regulatory environment and the institutional options available for
delivery, will often be the most sensible course to pursue.

In order to assess the opportunities for specific technologies in the context of the market, the
practitioner will need to investigate their potential for efficiency savings at a high-level. This
analysis should be comprised of a detailed assessment of the size of the market for the selected
equipment, including its types and variants, and the projected growth of the market in future
years.

Typically, market analysis can rely on secondary research techniques, for example the collection of
data from manufacturers, government statistics and previous studies. Useful information can be
found in UNIDO’s statistical databases44. Where representative secondary data are not available,
primary research such as industry-specific walk through audits and interviews with stakeholders
(e.g. traders and end-users) can be carried out. Whichever method is adopted, any study should
be conducted in cooperation with the client and industry stakeholders.



   Case study 6: Two different approaches to implementing energy
   efficiency credit lines, dictated by market selection45

   Project size and technical sophistication will often be key differentiating factors. For example,
   where the program focuses on small projects, with replication of similar technologies, then a
   practitioner may want to implement template-type appraisal approaches that have narrowly
   focused technical assessments coupled with simple systems for rating financial risk. In India,
   the banks run SME energy efficiency lending programs that define specific types of technical
   solutions for specific industries in specific geographic locations, and then seek to replicate a
   large number of identical small projects.

   Large projects typically require detailed feasibility studies, customized technical design
   work, and greater technical sophistication. An even higher degree of technical expertise is
   required where the project requires customized system-optimization approaches and in-
   depth knowledge of specific process technology. The Romanian Energy Efficiency Fund,
   for example, has relied primarily on investment project proposals, typically developed as
   customized projects to meet the needs of specific industrial enterprises, through individual
   technical studies and enterprise audits.

     Sub-step 2.2: Assessing the regulatory and institutional context
     Regulatory and institutional analysis comprises a survey and mapping exercise to identify the
     authorities, policies, targets and measures that are relevant to resource efficiency, climate change
     mitigation and industrial development. The information captured in this process will provide the
     practitioner with an understanding of the existing institutional and regulatory framework, and the
     challenges that may affect investments within a country.

     Understanding the underlying conditions will make it possible for the practitioner to build on
     what is already there, by designing programs that will be reinforced by the existing regulatory
     infrastructure. On the other hand, it will also reveal any institutional or regulatory gaps that might
     be addressed by an investment program. Together with a market assessment (see Sub-step 2.1:
     Assessing the market), it will provide the practitioner with a further tool to prioritize the support
     of one program over another.

     An institutional analysis should aim to assess the country’s financial, human and institutional
     capacity to:
     •	 implement new regulations;
     •	 provide technical guidance to relevant stakeholders (e.g. manufacturers, importers and
        retailers);
     •	 monitor and verify implementation;
     •	 enforce and respond to non-compliance offences;
     •	 evaluate the performance of the measure;
     •	 update regulations and measures as appropriate.

     The assessment should document the current context and provide a list of recommendations for
     areas of improvement, as well as capacity-building measures to cover the institutional capacity gaps
     identified. Consider who should lead the assessment and which stakeholders should be involved.

     A thorough analysis of the current regulatory and institutional capacity within a country can
     be conducted by following the checklist tool below. The analysis can be conducted through a
     review of secondary data; however, this may need to be supplemented with information gathered
     through stakeholder interviews. If there is no legislation / regulation in effect, the practitioner
     should determine whether there is any draft legislation in development and what barriers it might
     be facing.

1.	 Institutional integration
	 A strong dialogue across relevant government bodies helps to support the development
    of efficient industry. Policies relevant to the greening of industries cut across the domains
    of multiple agencies. Integration of environmental, social and economic objectives and
    actions should take place both “vertically” (between the international, national, and
    local tiers of government); and “horizontally” within government between ministries and
    departments.

Do relevant authorities coordinate horizontally? i.e. through:
FF Overarching strategies and policy frameworks
FF Coordination mechanisms (e.g. inter-agency working groups, joint-research programs etc.)
FF High-level inter-agency integration (e.g. within president’s or prime minister’s offices)
FF Developing in-house capacity (e.g. an environmental unit within an economic ministry)


Do relevant authorities coordinate vertically? i.e. through:
FF Capacity building of local government (e.g. through oversight, implementation support,
   policy guidance & staff training)
FF Appropriate funding and reporting mechanisms
FF Clear allocation of responsibilities between levels of government to avoid friction,
   overlaps, redundancies, or lengthy procedures
FF Information sharing to promote understanding of interlinked responsibilities and to
   facilitate coordinated decision-making

          including the community, NGOs, industry, trade unions.
     FF   Are agencies developing policies independent of political lobbying or external pressures?
     FF   Is there systematic use of environmental policy evaluations in the policy design cycle?
     FF   Are policies enforceable?
     FF   Is there a low compliance cost?

     7.	 Raising awareness and capacity building
     	 Governments can support industry sectors and businesses by promoting practices that
         facilitate them to trade based on sustainable business practices. Businesses need to be
         able to see the value in adopting sustainable practices. For example, understanding how
         consumer preferences are evolving in relation to sustainability issues in specific market
         segments and the resulting market opportunities.

     What tools are being used to raise awareness?
     FF High-profile demonstration projects.
     FF Personnel training.
     FF Provision of funds for small investments.
     FF Provision of resources to monitor and disseminate results of efficiency investments.

     Sub-step 2.3: Assessing existing resource use and efficiency
     opportunities
     To understand fully how to improve the efficiency of existing practices, it is important to develop a robust
     understanding of existing resource use within the industry sectors in question and the opportunities for
     efficiency improvements. The practitioner should therefore work with end-users to determine current
     resource and energy use patterns, and identify key common areas of environmental or resource risk.

     This section explains how to narrow down the focus of a program, once a target market has been
     identified. The focus here is on audits, however audits are not the only way to identify and define
     suitable programs.

     Industry associations should have an understanding of production practices and energy consumption
     patterns in their respective industrial subsector. Engaging with such associations can alleviate data
     collection burdens whilst ensuring that industry specific technical knowledge is gathered. Large and
     medium-size enterprises may have the internal technical capacity to identify potential resource efficiency
     opportunities themselves, and therefore be able to suggest what measures might best be included in a
     program. Furthermore, third parties such as equipment suppliers or ESCOs may already be successfully
     marketing predefined solutions for specific equipment applications (e.g. variable speed motor controls or
     boiler replacement projects, etc.). It is worth talking to stakeholders to see if these channels might lead
     to the appropriate scoping of a suitable program.

Conducting an audit
Audits provide a framework for a robust review of the efficiency of a facility. The findings can carry the
objectivity of an independent auditor, and will allow the cost-effective identification of potential efficiency
savings. This provides confidence that the program selected will be best suited to the end users.

Audits can be used to inform the development of a program, put can also be an integral part of
a program. They can be offered as mandatory or voluntary programs and be coupled with other
measures, such as efficiency goals for companies or financial support for efficiency investments.
Audit programs can be offered as part of a public sector or donor program, or can be financed by
enterprises themselves.

Depending on the scope of the potential program and the skills available, it may be possible for
the practitioner, or auditors appointed by the program team, to complete site audits on a sample
of installations, selected as representative of the industry overall. The use of equipment varies
between industries and industrial plants. Therefore, where possible this exercise should focus on
individual or similar groups of facilities. Audits can be carried out in two stages. A preliminary audit
done remotely (i.e. by phone or email in conjunction with site staff) can help to establish the key
inefficiencies prior to committing staff time to a site visit. Following this, a range of detailed and
quantitative audits may be needed to secure sufficient data to be useful for informing the design of
a credible program38.

        Case study 7: IFC Advisory Services work with the foundry industry in
        Bangladesh in 2003

        IFC Advisory Services in the South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) began work
        with the foundry industry in Bangladesh in 200346. Bangladesh has around 200 commercial
        foundries that produce an estimated 245,000 metric tonnes per annum of cast iron pipes,
        wellheads, engine parts, pump components, etc.

        The local foundry industry suffers heavily from low productivity and high product rejection, in
        comparison with regional counterparts. The IFC conducted a study, which indicated that the
        furnaces used had a life expectancy of 20-30 years, whereas some had been in operation for
        100 years. Melting pig iron and scrap metal using these older furnaces resulted in inadequate
        combustion, lower melting rates, higher pollution, and overall higher production costs.

        The project team leveraged the expertise of the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) of India
        as technology provider and implementation partner, and jointly identified two local potential
        service providers to introduce new furnace technologies. SEDF also collaborated with the
        Foundry Owners Association of Bogra (FOAB) to find two foundries that would be interested
        in hosting a divided blast cupola furnace as a pilot.

        The pilot study found that, in producing 1,600 tons of cast iron, one of the pilot foundries
        saved more than $76,000 in overhead and raw material costs in three months, giving a
        break-even point of just six months.



     Consider the technical evaluation necessary. Who might best undertake the necessary detailed project
     analysis? Bear in mind that local expertise may be lacking. Consider the program team’s in-house
     capacity, as well as those local groups that may hold useful knowledge. A cost-analysis may help in
     deciding the allocation of work.

If a practitioner is required to conduct an audit, or must employ a third party to carry one out, the
following details should be considered:
•	 Aim: Is the aim to document the total consumption of a given resource at the facility or only
    to identify equipment that accounts for significant consumption?
•	 Scope: What should be included within the audit? Will the audit be limited to specific
    technologies or processes (e.g. motors), or cover the whole facility?
•	 Responsible staff: Staff from the facility should be allocated to provide information, access to
    buildings and a contact point for the auditor.
•	 Existing data: Identify the availability, format and quality of existing data. Has there been
    relevant audit work carried out recently? Are relevant data collected under an existing system
    or scheme? Where are the gaps?
•	 Data collection & audit methodology: Decide on a standard audit methodology, e.g. ISO
    50002 or EN 16247. Agree a sampling approach. Consider the grouping of assets for auditing
    and site visits. Agree reference period. Agree acceptable estimation methodologies and use of
    assumptions.
•	 Business factors: Identify and examine any impending changes or other factors that may have
    a bearing on the assessment and its conclusions. For example, are there any plans for facility
    expansion, upgrade, mothballing, partial or complete closure, or sale.
•	 Expectations: Make it clear what the expectations are for the output of the audit, including
    any specific details required from the audit report. Are there any existing opinions and
    restrictions relating to potential efficiency measures? Does the company have particular
    evaluation criteria for opportunities, e.g. a payback period threshold or minimum Internal Rate
    of Return? Agree the format and contents of the resulting report.
•	 Timeline: Agree an audit timetable. Agree dates for completion of audit reports.

Usually the auditor should evaluate the impact of efficiency opportunities in economic terms,
including factors such as:
•	 the investment cost, including loan interest payments if appropriate;
•	 potential financial savings from reduced consumption of energy, water and other resources;
•	 other possible benefits such as gains in productivity or reduced maintenance requirements;
•	 the value of any carbon credits gained;
•	 any tax benefits.

      This will allow a comparison of the relative attractiveness of different efficiency measures. In making
      such comparisons it is important to consider the technical interactions between multiple actions since
      implementing one measure may reduce the savings achievable from another.

        Cost-benefit analysis of potential savings
        A cost-benefit analysis can be performed to examine the feasibility of an opportunity. It is
        recommended that methods of analysis based on lifetime discounted cash flow are used,
        such as Net Present Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR). These provide a more
        realistic way to measure and compare the cost-effectiveness of investments than more
        simplistic metrics such as payback period.

To help ensure that a site audit is undertaken as efficiently as possible, it is usual to request certain
information prior to visiting the site. This might include:
•	 Site plans
•	 Process flow schematics
•	 Details of energy and water metering;
•	 Consumption data as recorded;
•	 Use patterns of the facilities (i.e. hours / days of operation);
•	 Lists of equipment at the site, including ratings and specifications, particularly for significant
   energy consumers;
•	 Building services details including heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation and small power loads;
•	 Environment / energy management plan details;
•	 Building management systems (BMS) details;
•	 Any special access requirements; for example, for rooftop plant;
•	 Important contacts, including the responsibilities of those who control and maintain systems;
•	 Potential efficiency saving areas already identified.

Sample audits will help characterize the target industry, and therefore the applicability of
particular investment opportunities. Using the checklist below will also provide a practitioner with
an understanding of how far a given facility, firm or industry has moved towards investment in
efficiency and what stimuli exist for industry-led investments.

      Interviews with relevant facility staff (i.e. senior management, production engineering managers,
      energy/facility managers etc.) will help to establish the status of the companies’ energy
      management policies and strategies. As well as the points in the tool above, a practitioner may
      want to establish responsibilities for specification and procurement of equipment and to what
      extent adherence to any standards is required. If companies are not implementing any industry-
      led initiatives, then the key points to establish are:
      •	 How important is efficiency in the company’s culture? Is there a dedicated environmental
          manager or team? What influence and budget do they have, and are they able to present
          opportunities to company directors? Is there any internal environmental training? Are targets
          set and progress towards them measured?
      •	 Is the company able to monitor consumption? Is the necessary equipment and staff
          resource in place?
      •	 Is there a process for regularly reviewing opportunities? If so, does this involve senior
          managers?
      •	 What measures have been or are being taken? How were they identified? Are the people
          responsible in-house or external and what relevant qualifications and experience do they have?

9.	 Step Three:
	   Designing the program

Once a practitioner has gained an understanding of the local context, through stakeholder
engagement and relevant diagnostic research, they can start to specify a suitable program. This
section will provide guidance on how to select an appropriate market and institutional mechanism
for intervention, how to evaluate and delegate program risks, and how to put in place a results
framework for the monitoring and evaluation of the program.

      Sub-step 3.1: Selecting a program
      The results of the initial conversations with the client and stakeholders, as well as any diagnostic
      studies that have been carried out, should have resulted in a shortlist of technologies or processes
      that could be considered feasible investments under the given market, regulatory and institutional
      conditions. At this stage, it should be possible to select a specific program to take forward.

      An evaluation matrix can be used to prioritize programs or projects with a higher chance of
      success (see Table 6 for an illustration). The appropriate in-country stakeholders (including
      technical experts) should be invited to appraise the proposed subject(s) of the program according
      to the evaluation criteria selected. Based on the information captured against each parameter, the
      potential opportunity can be rated in order of prioritization, e.g. high, medium or low priority.

Sub-step 3.2: Selecting an institutional delivery mechanism
The successful delivery of a resource efficiency program requires an institutional mechanism
that combines technical, financial and management skills of the stakeholders on the ground.
However, typically, local financiers will lack technical evaluation skills, whilst technical and project
contractors will lack financial expertise. This requires the development of a strong link up between
stakeholders and the building of capacity within individual players. Governments and industry
leaders are critical in stimulating the development of relevant groupings.



  Case study 8: Access to technical capacity for energy efficiency in Brazil

  In Brazil, technical capacity and project development experience in energy efficiency were
  promoted through the national electricity conservation program (PROCEL), established in
  198538. PROCEL, managed by Eletrobras, the federal holding company in the electricity
  sector, operates by funding or co-funding energy efficiency projects such as research and
  development, education and training, testing, labelling, standards, demonstration, and others.

  PROCEL cooperates with state and local utilities, state agencies, private companies,
  universities, and research institutes. Donor support has played an important role in training
  of energy efficiency technical expertise. In the case of ESCOs, this support was largely
  channeled through ABESCO, the Brazil association of energy service companies.

  Although there is strong technical assessment capacity in Brazil, technical experts are often
  insufficiently linked to the practical needs of end users and financial institutions. Challenges
  remain to build the investment project development and risk assessment skills needed to
  expand commercial energy efficiency investment.



Local banks and ESCOs play an important role in creating a market for resource efficiency by providing
access to finance. However, in order for a resource efficiency investment to proceed, both the end user
and the financier must have confidence in the technical as well as the financial assessment. Banks need
to understand the characteristics and risks involved with efficiency investments in order to evaluate
project proposals and assign appropriate terms and conditions for loans and/ or co-financing. End users
will want to be assured that their financial and operational risks from the investment is minimized.



            3 DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM                                 4 IMPLEMENTATION                      107
      An institutional delivery mechanism is required that meets these needs. For example, banks
      may need training in understanding the cash flow of efficiency investments and the basic
      characteristics of relevant equipment (e.g. energy savings value, equipment design life, etc.), or
      they may need access to capable and credible technical assistance (e.g. ESCOs, consultants, etc.).

      There are a variety of institutional mechanisms that can be adopted for technical assessment,
      financial assessment and project development. Figure 14 illustrates the factors that will determine
      the institutional mechanism to select within a given situation.

Adequate institutional capacity for project development, as well as technical and financial appraisal
may be lacking in emerging economies. In these cases, the use of foreign consultants can be helpful,
if it is targeted and simultaneously develops local capacity. However, foreign consultants are typically
more expensive and may not be able to spend as much time in-country. Unless carefully chosen, they
may also lack local knowledge and have difficulty adapting to the local working culture.

The adoption of a simpler program design can reduce consultant costs. Where that is not an option,
the use of a mix of regional and international expertise may reduce cost. For example, the relevant
skills may be found in regional development hubs such as Thailand, Japan, and India in Asia, or
Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico in Latin America38. If the program is of sufficient duration, consider
the comparative cost of engaging full-time advisors in order to reduce consultant costs, improve
knowledge transfer to local staff, and improve the quality and relevance of the outputs.

      When designing an appropriate institutional mechanism, the allocation of certain roles may be
      dictated by the country’s legal system or local ways of doing business. For example, in Jordan it was
      found that distrust towards energy service companies - that provide energy audits and other related
      services - was very high and hindered growth in the market for energy efficiency. Figure 15 shows the
      typical stakeholder profiles on the ground, prior to the initiation of an energy efficiency program.

If local financiers are to be involved in the project, the practitioner, together with stakeholders,
will need to decide whether financiers and enterprises will need to outsource services, or develop
them in-house. In many emerging economies, contracting may be based on relationships rather
than the legalistic approaches typical in developed countries. Therefore, when making this
decision consider the following key factors:
•	 the level of trust in the outside service provider;
•	 the state contracting and enforcement institutions;
•	 the transaction costs;
•	 the perception of the value added through building in-house capacity.

The usual options available for obtaining outsourced expertise, for project development or assessment
are shown in Table 7.

Sub-step 3.3: Assessing program risks and task allocation
The initial program development costs are high-risk outlays that are usually unrecoverable if program
development is unsuccessful. The use of strategic partners to take on specific tasks can help to reduce
these initial costs, thereby reducing the risk involved with the program.

In order for a specific resource efficiency investment to proceed, both the end user and the financier
must be confident in the technical assessment. Financiers will want to see that all of the key criteria
that may affect projected savings have been identified and the associated risks assessed. The end
users will want to know that their financial and operational risks are understood and minimized. This
may mean that both the financier and end user require their own independent technical reviews.
The selection of a technical contractor with a strong reputation may reduce these duplications of
assessment, reducing project costs.

If the project is not successful, then the risk will be borne by or shared among the client enterprise,
the contractor, financier, or project team. When assessing these risks, consider the following38:
1.	 Technical performance: How might the installed equipment fail, or deliver lower than expected
    results? What has been done to mitigate these risks? For example, is the equipment guaranteed
    under a manufacturer or supplier warranty?
2.	 Project implementation plan: Will installation disrupt production at the recipient’s facilities (e.g.
    because of delays in the contractor procurement, construction, supply of equipment, testing etc.)?
    Who should be responsible for each stage of implementation and how will they be held to account
    for delivery?
3.	 Capacity factor: The patterns of use of the technology or processes can affect savings. For
    example, changes in production levels due to market conditions may affect the return on
    investment;
4.	 Quality of inputs and operation: The quality of inputs can affect the efficiency of clean
    technologies. For example, a poor quality fuel supply or lack of skills amongst operational staff may
    result in a sub-optimal performance. Can this risk be mitigated through training?
5.	 Price variations: Price variations (e.g. energy prices) can change the attractiveness of a project.

      Where there is joint funding of a project, the end user and financier will need to agree the risk
      allocation. They share a mutual interest that the project will return net positive cash flows in sufficient
      levels and on time. However, they also have different goals and these should be considered when
      engaging with each (Figure 16). By understanding these perspectives, it will make it easier to present
      the right case to each, and rule out end users who would not meet the criteria.

Sub-step 3.4: Establishing a framework for monitoring and evaluation
A results framework, such as that produced by the World Bank Group48, represents the
underlying logic that explains how the objectives of the program are to be achieved. It is
intended to serve as a management tool for both the industrial enterprise and the program
manager at every stage of the program cycle. Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness
of projects and achieve the desired outcomes, a practitioner should begin considering the
results framework from the outset of the program.

Development of the results framework is a dynamic and iterative process that begins
during program identification, and is only completed at the evaluation stage. Four pieces of
information will be required to develop a results framework:
1.	 a shared understanding of the problem and the desired impact of the program;
2.	 a series of hypotheses of how the program inputs will lead to the desired outcomes;
3.	 knowledge of the type of evidence required to assess progress toward results; and
4.	 an understanding of the existing data sources and instruments available in the country.

Although at the concept stage there will be insufficient information to complete the results
framework, when discussing the program concept some key definitions will start to give shape
to the framework, such as the proposed program development objectives, key performance
indicators and possible risks.

At the preparation stage the results framework serves as a tool for strategic planning and better
program design. It helps the borrower, the lender, and any other development partners set the
objectives and necessary arrangements to measure progress toward the achievement of those
objectives. The results framework also helps build consensus and ownership around shared
objectives and the arrangements to be used in achieving these objectives.

      Assess baseline resource use
      In addition to reducing resource consumption, and therefore reducing cost to business, CCI
      projects share the common goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industry. This
      section provides details on how to conduct a baseline assessment and to calculate the potential
      efficiency savings associated with the program, and how to place those savings in the context of
      greenhouse gas emissions. This has added importance for industry as following the Paris Climate
      Agreement, emission reduction is becoming a key element in global industrial policy, and it will be
      of increasing interest to business to quantify their emissions reductions.

      Establishing a good understanding of resource use, based on accurate production and
      consumption data, provides the basis for the monitoring and evaluation of the program. This
      section provides details on how to conduct a baseline assessment to determine the efficiency of
      a business’ current operations. Depending on the program, the baseline data requirements that
      should be considered include:
      •	 energy used by energy source/fuel type;
      •	 water used by water source;
      •	 waste generated by the waste type;
      •	 raw material used by type.

      The measurement of baseline consumption is a critical aspect of any efficiency program, it is
      central to calculating the potential savings at the outset, and later in the evaluation of the success
      of the project. This section outlines a method that can be used to calculate the savings from an
      industrial efficiency program. The method focusses on energy use, but can be used to assess the
      use of any resource.

      A baseline measurement should be gathered before a project begins to form a comparison with
      measurements taken during and at the end of the program. This will allow monitoring and
      assessment of the efficacy of the activities undertaken. Baseline information should be established
      for a 24-month period where this is available, as this will serve to highlight any seasonal trends,
      but as a minimum baseline data should consist of at least a 12-month data set.

In the case of energy, each piece of energy consuming equipment has a baseline level of energy
use; their combined energy use forms the overall baseline for a specific project. The baseline
can therefore be defined as the energy consumption that would have occurred if no energy
conservation measures had been implemented. For example, if 2016 is taken as a baseline year,
and a chemical factory uses 1,000 MWh from 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2016, then
its baseline energy is 1,000 MWh. In 2020, if the same chemical factory uses 800 MWh from 1
January 2020 until 31 December 2020, then its reduction in energy use is 200 MWh




    Baseline                              Current                               Reduction in
    energy use                            energy use                            energy use
    (e.g. 1,000 MWh)                      (e.g. 800 MWh)                        (e.g. 200 MWh)




However, baseline calculations for industry are often more useful if they include a ratio indicator.
For example, if a chemical factory uses 1,000,000 kWh to produce 1,000 tonnes of a Product
A from 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2016, then its baseline energy is 1,000,000 kWh per
1,000 tonnes. In other words, it needs 1,000 kWh to produce one ton of Product A; this factor is
known as the ‘specific energy consumption’ and in this case would be expressed in terms of kWh
per ton. Using a measure of activity, such as output production, can help to account for changes
that are due to external factors (e.g. a change in production quantity due to economic factors).
It is important to appreciate that the relationship between specific energy consumption and the
activity measure will not be linear since there are fixed components of energy use that will not be
affected by the level of activity. In fact, the under-use of production capacity will be less energy
efficient than production at full plant capacity, irrespective of energy efficiency measures that
might be introduced. In evaluating a program, it is important that apparent energy efficiency
gains, or losses, due to varying production are not attributed to the program’s interventions.




            3 DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM                               4 IMPLEMENTATION                    117
      For calculating emissions, energy consumption can be divided into two categories, primary and
      delivered. Delivered energy is the amount of energy consumed at the point of sale (e.g. that
      enters the facility) without adjustment for any energy loss in the generation, transmission, and
      distribution of that energy. As such, it is the sum of fossil and renewable fuels (e.g., biomass
      or fuel wood) and purchased electricity. Primary energy consumption comprises the delivered
      energy as well as the energy that is produced by the utility company, but lost during generation,
      transmission, and distribution.

      It is important to consider which type of energy use is appropriate for the program. If the goal
      is to capture the absolute emissions from industrial production, then primary energy should be
      used. Whereas if the goal is to concentrate on only the emissions that are under an industry’s
      direct control, then delivered energy might be more appropriate.

      Assess baseline greenhouse gas emissions
      In order to assess the baseline greenhouse gas emissions associated with industrial production it
      is first important to decide which type of emissions will be the best indicator of the success of the
      program. GHG emissions can be split into four broad categories:
      •	 Upstream emissions are emissions which occur upstream in the supply chain, and over which
           the business has no direct control (e.g. raw material extraction or upstream manufacturing of
           parts). These are, in most cases, excluded from GHG emissions reduction calculations unless
           required for a particular standard. Where upstream emission sources need to be included, if
           they are not available for measurement, they can be estimated based on external research
           and/or standard industry practices.
      •	 Operational emissions are emission sources associated with the target facility’s (or industry
           sector’s) onsite processes and activities. These GHG emissions should be calculated as part of
           monitoring and evaluation and included where significant. The following emissions sources
           should be considered: mobile fuel combustion; stationary fuel combustion used for back-up
           power or other purposes; electricity, heat, and steam purchased from third parties; onsite non-
           energy related processes; other emission sources.
      •	 Downstream emissions are emissions which occur downstream in the supply chain, and
           over which the business has no direct control (e.g. the transportation, end-use and disposal
           of manufactured goods). These are usually excluded from GHG emission calculations. Where
           downstream emission sources need to be included, if they are not available for measurement,
           they can be estimated based on external research and/or standard industry practices.

•	 Leakage is a change in GHG emissions beyond the program boundary and can result from
   displacing a source of GHG emissions off-site or causing an unrelated increase in GHG
   emissions at a third party operation. For the most part, leakage is negligible unless otherwise
   described in specific project methodologies.

Two methods can be used to assess the impact that the program has had on emissions. The
first method includes all types of emissions, and avoids the potential for emission ‘leakage’, i.e.
emissions being transferred out of the scope of measurement, but not actually reducing.

The second, simplified method, would only concentrate on a business’s operational emissions, i.e.
the emissions that are under a business’s direct control. In the case of energy, this would involve
applying a greenhouse gas factor to measured use of each fuel or energy source. For example,
if 2016 is taken as a baseline year, and a chemical factory uses 1,000,000 kWh of Fuel 1 from 1
January 2016 until 31 December 2016, then its baseline energy is 1,000,000 kWh multiplied by
the carbon factor for Fuel 1.

      The greenhouse gas emissions reduction can be calculated in the same way as the reduction in
      resource use, by subtracting the emissions during (or at the end) of the project from the baseline
      emissions.

This module will assist the practitioner in meeting the specific needs of industry when
implementing an efficiency program or project, by providing step-by-step guidance on what
needs to be done at each stage of implementation. It is written primarily for the benefit of
practitioners, but will also be useful to industrial enterprises and trade bodies interested in project
implementation. This module is structured into four practical steps:

      11.	 Step One:
      	    Building stakeholder capacity

      The successful implementation of measures to increase resource efficiency across any particular
      industry is dependent on the involvement of various stakeholders operating at different levels,
      ranging from policymakers to factory owners. The efficacy of implementation is largely dependent
      on the capacity of each stakeholder group to enact resource efficiency measures, and by the
      overall effort and ability to coordinate and collaborate among groups.

      This section highlights the need, while indicating some of the key components necessary, for
      effective capacity building. Information on how to identify and classify the relevant stakeholders is
      provided in Sub-step 1.3: Planning stakeholder engagement.

      Engagement with all the relevant stakeholders will help to form effective and equitable
      partnerships and create a sense of mutual responsibility. This dialogue will also help to improve
      transparency and accountability. The key aspects of capacity building programs include:
      •	 Capacity building and training materials should be developed and disseminated to public
         and private banks, ESCOs, industry associations and end-users. In addition to basic energy
         efficiency financing information, training materials should build knowledge of technical,
         managerial and monitoring aspects. This information should include: industry basic training
         material and booklets, commercial banks basic training materials (to be tailored for each),
         utilities basic training materials and booklets, ESCO/technician basic training materials to
         support investment grade audits and other best practices;
      •	 Standard contract templates can be prepared using existing and successful contract
         formats to engage future service providers and regulatory bodies. They can subsequently
         be tailored to suit the industry’s financial and legal requirements. These may include loan
         and energy savings agreements, which can also be used as templates for facilitating future
         transactions. Standard contracts should be distributed and made available to stakeholders
         along with the other materials in this list;

•	 Monitoring and evaluation protocols for project data should be developed and shared with
   industries, ESCOs, utilities, technicians and banks. This will help to track the success of the
   program, and to make standardized economic and quantitative resource savings data available
   to other stakeholders. Protocols should cover requirements and methods for gathering,
   analyzing and reporting data, as well as the dissemination of data to SMEs, ESCOs and banks;
•	 Communication and dissemination of the capacity building materials should be designed
   to address all key stakeholders. Materials should be made available through existing online
   portals of service providers, industries and other stakeholders, and through any other relevant
   source;
•	 Capacity building events for ESCOs, technicians and industry should be organized on a
   regular basis, to provide targeted training on conducting audits, developing baselines, program
   design, financing, implementation, repair and maintenance, and monitoring. This training
   should take place in partnership with utilities, vendors, technology providers and financing
   institutions. Stakeholders should receive capacity building materials and basic training courses
   on efficiency benefits and opportunities. Training materials for technical components should
   also be developed with the help of vendors, technology providers and ESCOs, to maximize
   their potential for wide dissemination to different stakeholders.
•	 Standard documents to be developed should include, but not be limited to:
   a.	 guidelines on technology procurement;
   b.	 guidelines on collaboration with private sector and other partners;
   c.	 guidelines on environmental, social and occupational health and safety issues;
   d.	 guidelines on stakeholder engagement strategies;
   e.	 guidelines on project management;
   f.	 quality control matrices;
   g.	 guidelines on large-scale project development strategy;
   h.	 a list of key policy considerations;
   i.	 advice on subscription to leading e-resources;
   j.	 guidelines on mapping of external and internal risks, and risk awareness and management
       guidelines.

      Case study 9: Capacity building - Malaysian Industrial Energy Efficiency
      Improvement Project (MIEEIP)

      To address barriers to energy efficiency in the country’s industrial sector, the Government of
      Malaysia initiated the Malaysian Industrial Energy Efficiency Improvement Project (MIEEIP)
      in 1999 to improve the rational use of energy in the industrial sector. Support and funding
      was provided by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development
      Programme (UNDP) as well as the Government of Malaysia and the private sector. UNDP is
      the project implementing agency on behalf of the GEF. The Ministry of Energy, Water and
      Communications (MEWC) was appointed as the project’s executing agency, whereas Pusat
      Tenaga Malaysia (PTM) is the designated implementing agency.

      The project incorporates measures for capacity strengthening and a demonstration incentive
      scheme. MIEEIP initially focused on eight energy-intensive industries (wood, rubber, food,
      ceramics, glass, pulp & paper, iron & steel and cement). During project implementation, three
      other sub-sectors were later added (plastics, textile and oleo-chemical). It is expected that at
      the end of the project, Malaysia will have a foundation for continued efforts to capture the
      energy efficiency potential within the industry sector.

12.	 Step Two:
	    Securing industry commitment

For a business to embrace a resource efficiency project there must be buy-in from all levels of
the organization. The practitioner should therefore work with the end-user(s) to develop an
understanding of their current commitment to resource efficiency. The aim of this exercise is to
use the dialogue to explain the benefits of resource efficiency and to find solutions to the specific
barriers faced by the business. This process will build trust and help secure the buy-in necessary
for successful implementation.

Once buy-in from a business’s senior management is secured, the next step will be to help the
management team to instill a resource efficiency mindset throughout the business. This process
will usually involve the creation of company policy and operational documentation, and the
development of appropriate two-way communications programs to inform and engage with the
wider workforce. At this stage, the practitioner should help the management team to consider
the necessary skills, authority, time and interest that key individuals can bring to the process.

Businesses should be encouraged to establish a resource management team, dedicated to
developing and implementing a resource efficiency program. There are a number of advantages
in establishing a resource management team to plan, implement and communicate resource
efficiencies across the business. For example, a dedicated resource management team can:
•	 provide a holistic view of business resource use;
•	 actively engage with decision-makers (e.g. senior leadership who may not be involved in the
    detailed aspects of the project);
•	 provide a forum for monitoring and reviewing the progress of implementation;
•	 help develop strategies that can be integrated into long-term business objectives;
•	 share the workload between the team members.

      The business may not need to establish a new team. It could build on an existing EMS or Health
      and Safety team, should that team’s technical capacity be adequate. A resource management
      team can be made up of various key individuals, including:
      •	 Site and other managers who have experience in the industry and are able to adopt a
         business-wide perspective. Managers are also key to securing cooperation amongst staff;
      •	 Operators who are familiar with the day-to-day issues involved in the operation of the facility
         and can help identify problems and opportunities;
      •	 Technical staff who have detailed experience and knowledge of the plant, equipment and
         operational issues, as well as insights into why certain priorities or procedures have evolved;
      •	 Sub-contractors and service providers who are likely to be familiar with the detail of on-site
         equipment and the challenges faced, and may have ideas about how new technologies or
         practices can improve resource utilization and bring other benefits;
      •	 Business-improvement staff or external consultants who have analytical and facilitation
         skills, and a broad perspective on strategies for identifying opportunities and creatively
         capturing them across the site.

      Early establishment of a team means that it can become directly involved in the planning for
      resource efficiency and ensure integration of the program with the ongoing business strategy.

13.	 Step Three:
	    Controlling and monitoring 					
	implementation

As implementation proceeds, the program may need to be reviewed and revised. Undertaking
regular reviews to evaluate the success of the program is an integral part of the continuous
improvement process and essential for the program’s continued success. This section explains how
to carry out effective monitoring and evaluation and why this is important.

Monitoring and evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is a process by which the practitioner can compare baseline
data to the anticipated results of a resource efficiency project. This information can be used
to determine if the intended results of the project are being achieved as planned, and what
corrective action may be needed to ensure delivery of the intended results.

M&E provides opportunities at regular pre-determined points to validate the logic of a program,
its activities and their implementation, and to make adjustments as needed. Good planning and
design alone do not ensure results. Progress towards achieving results needs to be monitored.
Conversely, no amount of good monitoring alone will correct poor program design, plans and
results. Information from monitoring provides critical input to evaluation, which in turn can be
used to improve action plans and encourage further improvements. The aim of a monitoring
exercise is to answer the following questions:
•	 Are the anticipated outputs being produced as planned?
•	 What issues, risks and challenges are being faced or anticipated; and what action is needed to
    ensure the achievement of results?
•	 Will the recorded program savings result in the achievement of the program objectives?
•	 What lessons are being learned?

      As well as monitoring, evaluation is an integral part of program management, providing an
      assessment of what worked and what did not work, and why this was the case. Evaluation can
      also help to identify any unintended consequences arising. This feedback can be used to improve
      ongoing program management and inform the development of future strategy. Information
      generated from program evaluations contributes to organizational learning as well as the global
      knowledge base on program development.

      Effective monitoring and evaluation49 is important because it:
      •	 Supports program implementation. Accurate, evidence-based reporting can inform
         program management and decision-making, helping to improve future performance;
      •	 Contributes to organizational learning and knowledge sharing, through reflection on the
         implementation experience and lessons learnt;
      •	 Upholds accountability and compliance by determining whether or not the program has
         been carried out as agreed;
      •	 Provides opportunities for stakeholders to provide feedback on the performance of the
         program, facilitating future program development and improving trust between stakeholders;
      •	 Promotes the program by highlighting its accomplishments and achievements, building
         morale within the team and interest from external parties (e.g. potential clients or partners).

      An M&E framework requires independent and robust baseline data as well as an adequate
      measurement and verification (M&V) regime. To implement any M&E regime, it is important for
      the program to have an M&V process that is acceptable to all the stakeholders. Different M&V
      frameworks are explained in the next section on Measurement and verification.

      After a project has been monitored for some time, it is good practice to commission an
      independent in-depth evaluation to take stock of project progress. This should bring a fresh,
      objective and independent perspective on how well the project is achieving its goals, and how the
      process might be made more efficient.

      Key points to consider whilst drafting an evaluation program are highlighted in Table 8. The type
      of M&E system used will depend on the following:
      •	 pre-determined targets and goals;
      •	 prescriptions set at the policy level (e.g. if certain product groups have been prioritized already
         at policy level);
      •	 the information tracking systems used by authorities that are subject to monitoring
         (e.g. if they have a centralized monitoring or implementation system or not, etc.).

      Measurement and verification
      The objective of measurement and verification is to quantify the energy savings resulting from
      implementation of energy conservation activities in a rigorous and transparent way. It is an
      important tool, which assists the M&E process in any program design.

      Monitoring and verification (M&V) are important management tools for tracking progress and
      facilitating decision-making. While some funders require evaluative processes, the greatest
      beneficiaries of an evaluation can be the community of people with whom the organization works.
      By closely examining the work, a given organization can design programs and activities that are
      effective, efficient, and yield powerful results for the program manager and all stakeholders.

      The basic principle of M&V is to compare the measured energy consumption and demand, both
      before and after implementing Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs), in order to determine the
      energy savings. M&V can also serve to improve facility operation and foster ongoing savings.
      As shown in Figure 18, M&V activities overlap with other project efforts (e.g. collecting data to
      both identify ECMs and establish energy baselines, commissioning and operational verification of
      installed ECMs, and installing monitoring systems to track and maintain savings persistence, etc.).
      Identifying these project synergies and establishing roles and responsibilities of involved parties
      during project planning will support a coordinated team effort54.

      An M&V plan is included in most energy saving performance contracts. Its components depend
      on the nature of the project and the individual actions to be undertaken. These are often finalized
      after the completion of the Investment Grade Audit (IGA). The following list provides an overview
      of the standard components of an M&V plan; they can be used as a guide, and modified based
      on project specifications.
      •	 description of energy conservation measures, intended results, and the measurement boundary.
          The measurement boundary is a “notional boundary that defines the physical scope of an M&V
          project. The effects of an ECM are determined at this boundary”. For example, the measurement
          boundary might be for: the whole facility; a sub facility; a lighting circuit; a mechanical services
          plant room; an electrical switchboard; or individual items of plant and equipment.

      14.	 Step Four:
      	    Communicating the impact

      Effective communication of the success of the program is critical to distribute the knowledge
      gained throughout the program and to reinforce buy-in from stakeholders. The benefits of the
      effective communication of results include:
      •	 inspiring and educating others to take action, including by using the program;
      •	 informing stakeholders of the program’s progress in achieving its objectives;
      •	 promoting the program as a leader in the field.

      Reporting GHG reductions using everyday equivalents is an effective way of enabling stakeholders
      to engage with the results.

      For example, 1 metric ton of CO2 (or CO2 equivalent) is equivalent to55:
      	    0.211	 passenger vehicles driven for one year
      	    3,832	 kilometers driven by an average passenger vehicle
      	    0.358	 tons of waste sent to the landfill
      	    0.051	 garbage trucks of waste recycled instead of landfilled
      	      428	 liters of gasoline consumed
      	      487	 kilograms of coal burned
      	    0.091	 homes’ energy use for one year
      	 0.0003	 wind turbines installed
      	    0.138	 homes’ electricity use for one year
      	     26.2	 incandescent lamps switched to CFLs
      	      2.3	 barrels of oil consumed

1,000 metric tons of CO2 (or CO2 equivalent) is equivalent to:
	 0.0003	 Coal-fired power plants in one year

1 metric ton of CO2 (or CO2 equivalent) is equivalent to the carbon sequestered by:
	     25.6	 tree seedlings grown for 10 years
	 0.0033	 square kilometers of forests in one year

The US EPA’s calculator55 can be used to report reductions in other GHGs in everyday terms.
Such factors do vary from country to country so it is important to check that what is proposed is
representative of the country or region in question.

Potential clients that the World Bank may support in the field of standards and labelling will
depend on a country’s specific circumstances and therefore the nature of the support required.
Clients are likely to include relevant government departments, for example ministries of energy,
environment, commerce and industry, finance and taxation. Other potential clients may include
industry trade bodies, standards organisations and product test laboratories.

The client or clients for a particular intervention will depend on who has been mandated to
develop a standards and labelling scheme. Furthermore, any previous work that has been
undertaken in the area will affect the nature of the support required. For example, if a standards
and labelling scheme has already been established, support may need to be focused on
monitoring and compliance to improve the scheme’s effectiveness, rather than provide market
analysis.

      16.	 Overview of Standards and Labelling

      What do we mean by standards and labelling?
      Standards and labelling56 schemes or programs are tools that can be used to improve the
      environmental performance of products and equipment used across all sectors of the economy. This
      guide focuses on equipment used by industry, but the principles are applicable across all sectors
      including domestic appliances.

      The format of standards and labels varies, however they tend to focus on the key environmental
      impacts of a particular product, and can include requirements on a single environmental parameter or
      several parameters depending on the design and overall aims of the program. Energy efficiency has
      historically been at the core of most standards and labels, although some, including the EU’s labelling
      scheme, also include other environmental factors such as water use.

      Standards and labelling schemes also vary in other ways; for example, they can be mandatory or
      voluntary, and require different levels of compliance verification. These characteristics are discussed in
      more detail later in this module. Standards and labelling schemes are commonly run by a government
      agency. Industry voluntary agreements or initiatives, such as those run by a relevant trade body, while
      not classed together with standards and labelling schemes, often share similar characteristics.

      Before looking in more detail at standards and labelling it is useful to outline what is meant by
      standards and labelling within the context of this guide.

      In 2013, the Australian Department of Industry commissioned a report focused on energy standards and
      labelling schemes throughout the world. Based on a comprehensive review, it provides a useful insight
      regarding the global position57 58. It reports that national standards and labelling (S&L) programs have
      become commonplace around the world; the box opposite provides a snapshot of the key findings.


      56	 The term ‘standards and labelling’ is a widely used short hand expression among energy efficiency and product policy
          practitioners to describe the two most common regulatory instruments used in product policy. It is important to note that the
          term ‘standard’ has more than one meaning, as clarified in the section on Standards below.

National Standards and Labelling: what is out there?
•	 81 countries (from 50 in 2004) now have a standards and labelling program.
•	 55 different products are subject to mandatory energy performance standard measures
   (from 42 in 2004).
•	 3,604 measures in 2013 (from 1,220 measures in 2004) that includes all types of
   standards and labelling measures in different countries around the world, comprising:
   –	 1,453 (431 in 2004) using energy performance standard measures (including proposed)
   –	 1,149 (354 in 2004) for comparative labels used (or proposed) for all product
       categories. Comparative labels have now overtaken endorsement labelling in absolute
       numbers, 80% of which are mandatory.
   –	 1,002 (435 in 2004) for endorsement labels used (or proposed) for all product
       categories, with more than 95% of all endorsement labels remaining voluntary and
       applicable to or targeted at the most energy efficient of products.

•	 The most commonly regulated product types used in industry are:
   –	 Motors (including 3 phase) – 90 measures
   –	 Air conditioners (central/3 phase) – 89 measures
   –	 Lamps or ballasts (67 countries with lamps alone, accounting for some 358 separate
      measures across all lamps types).
   –	 Furnaces – 69 measures
   –	 Fans (all types) 62 measures
   –	 Transformers – 45 measures
   –	 Pumps – 43 measures
   –	 Heat pumps – 40 measures

•	 The countries with the most active national programs are:
   –	 China with 100 measures.
   –	 USA with 86 measures.
   –	 South Korea with 78 measures
   –	 All EU countries with 77 measures

Note that the breadth of scope of measures will affect the total product energy consumption
subjected to standards and labelling measure, meaning a higher number of measures will
not necessarily mean wider product coverage.

      Labelling
      Labelling schemes can be divided into ‘comparative’ and ‘endorsement’ types.

                           Comparative                                Endorsement

      Comparative labelling enables the performance of different models of products to be compared, for
      example by using a continuous scale or discrete performance categories. In contrast, endorsement
      labels are used to indicate that a product meets a single set of prescribed criteria. Both types of
      labels provide the purchaser with information on the energy and sometimes wider environmental
      performance of the product, which can inform their purchasing decisions.

      Standards
      Even within the world of standards and labelling, the term ‘standards’ is used to mean different things
      depending on the context; for example, it can refer to:
      •	 Standards setting out procedures and methods for the testing of products; or
      •	 Standards specifying performance limits or minimum performance thresholds for the products
         themselves:
         –	 Such performance limits can be included as part of non-binding technical standards, for example
            the IEC standard for electric motors (IEC60034-30-1) defines four energy efficiency classes (IE1,
            IE2, IE3, IE4), however it does not specify that particular types or applications of motors must or
            should belong to particular efficiency classes. The adoption of such standards is voluntary.
         –	 Alternatively, regulatory product performance limits or criteria for particular types of products,
            for example different types of electric motors, can be included as part of standards and
            labelling schemes established at regional or national levels, often with reference to the relevant
            technical standard.

Within the context of using standards to improve the environmental performance of products,
for example energy efficiency, the setting of performance limits for particular types of products is
the key focus. Test standards are of relevance however, as they are used to ensure that tests and
calculations to demonstrate compliance with particular limits are undertaken consistently and
accurately across industry and the supply chain.

Figure 20 summarizes the key types of standards and the interaction between the different
types. Typically, test standards and technical standards are developed by recognized standards
bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Regional organization bodies also exist, for example the
European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardization (CENELEC), as well as national bodies, such as the Standardization Administration
of the People’s Republic of China (SAC).

The standards developed can be harmonized at international and regional levels, or can be
country specific depending on the product. Most countries have their own National Standards
Bodies, with the foremost organizations in each country being a member of ISO59. Developing
countries represent over 75% of ISOs members60, with support for developing countries led by
DEVCO (the ISO committee on developing country matters)61.

Standards (under a Standards and Labelling Scheme) that set performance limits can be divided
into three main types (see Figure 20):
•	 The first is minimum energy performance standards (MEPS), these set minimum requirements
   that a defined type of product must meet, but are general independent of technology so
   manufacturers can decide themselves how best to achieve the standard.
•	 The second type are prescriptive standards, which require particular features to be included as
   part of a product or may ban the sale of a particular type of product technology.
•	 The final type of performance limits or targets are known as class average. These set an average
   efficiency target for a defined product group in order to achieve an overall improvement in
   energy performance. This approach provides flexibility in how the target is achieved through
   the products that contribute to the targeted energy use, with class average reflecting that some
   products within the group may have a higher or lower efficiency than the target.

How do standards and labelling schemes work?
Standards and labelling are designed to influence the market for a particular product and
promote improvements in energy efficiency. They can also embrace additional environmental
performance aspects of the product. Standards and labelling work in different ways, and can be
seen as complementary policies. Figure 21 illustrates the effects of standards and labelling on the
market for products and how the two interact.

      The introduction of mandatory minimum performance standards acts as a ‘push’ for
      manufacturers to remove the most inefficient products from the market (for voluntary minimum
      standards, the sharp cut off shown in Figure 21 will be less pronounced, although in practice
      most minimum performance standards are mandatory – see below). This establishes a baseline
      that manufacturers can aim to exceed, providing an incentive to some manufacturers to innovate
      and explore how far they can go beyond the minimum standard in the knowledge that over time
      the minimum standard is likely to be tightened.

In contrast, labelling provides consumers with information on the environmental performance
of products, typically energy, promoting demand for higher performing products. By helping
consumers to make an informed decision this tends to ‘pull’ the market towards higher
efficiency products as consumers look to purchase the best they can to reduce running costs. To
a lesser degree, labelling can also incentivize manufacturers to improve products to enable an
endorsement label to be awarded, or in the case of a comparative label, to demonstrate their
products perform at the highest level.

Voluntary versus mandatory standards and labelling schemes
A key characteristic of standards and labelling is the basis on which they are introduced.
This can be on a voluntary or mandatory basis and both have their own advantages and
disadvantages. However, it is worth noting that certain types of standards and labelling are
predominately either mandatory or voluntary. MEPS and comparative labels are often used
to complement each other and are mainly implemented on a mandatory basis. As part of
these mandatory schemes, it is common for a transitional period to be included, where
requirements will initially be voluntary, before becoming mandatory. This allows the market
and manufacturers time to adjust to the new requirements. The transitional period is usually
stated within the regulations implementing the standards and labelling requirements for a
given product type. The length of the transitional period will depend on factors such as the
status of existing products on the market, readiness of manufacturers and awareness amongst
consumers. Industry will usually feed into the setting of transitional periods as part of the
consultation process. In contrast, endorsement labels are typically implemented on a voluntary
basis only.




               3 IMPLEMENTATION                                  4 STANDARDS                      157
      Codes of conduct or agreements with industry related to the performance of products they produce
      and sell often include minimum energy performance standards, but tend to be voluntary. However,
      the use of a code of conduct or voluntary agreement is usually on the basis that the majority of
      the manufacturers/suppliers are participating to ensure they are effective at improving the energy
      efficiency of the products covered. For example, under the Ecodesign Directive in Europe there is
      scope to use voluntary agreements instead of mandatory regulatory measures; appropriate voluntary
      agreements tend to work best within smaller sized industries. Where there is limited sign up by
      industry or the market structure does not lend itself to a code of conduct, then a mandatory approach
      would normally be employed.

      Monitoring and verification
      Monitoring and Verification are important elements of any standards and labelling scheme. How rigorous
      this needs to be will depend upon the basis of the label, for example, a mandatory comparative energy
      label or MEPS is likely to require third party testing and verification, while for a voluntary endorsement
      label a form of self-declaration by the manufacturers may be considered sufficient.

      A key aspect of the verification process is the use of test standards. They are an important element
      of standard and labelling schemes as they ensure that all products are tested on an equal and
      consistent basis.

      Monitoring is discussed further under Implementation, and will include aspects such as assessing
      verification information provided by manufacturers and undertaking market surveillance and data
      collection to ensure the scheme is robust and not undermined by false claims.

      Additional incentives for purchasers
      As well as the benefits of greater energy efficiency, further incentives can also be used as part of, or
      in conjunction with, standard and labelling schemes. For example, in the UK the Water Technology
      List (WTL)63 and Energy Technology List (ETL)64 are capital allowance schemes whereby purchasers
      of equipment can claim a business tax incentive when purchasing products from these lists. As part
      of these schemes, manufacturers must demonstrate their products meet specified criteria. Once
      a product is added to a list the manufacturer can display the relevant scheme logo for marketing
      purposes in respect of that product.

Other countries have also applied incentives for the purchasing of products that meet a particular
energy efficiency standard. For example, in China businesses that purchase and use energy saving
equipment that satisfy prescribed criteria can apply for a 10% tax reduction on the amount invested.

Separate studies are available that provide further information on the wider use of green tax
incentives and penalties such as grants, subsidies and loans. In particular, readers should refer to the
World Bank guide, Green Incentives for Climate Competitive Industries: A Practitioner’s Handbook65.

Regional and international schemes
Standards and labelling schemes are usually implemented on a national basis, although there are
some exceptions, and regional initiatives may run alongside or instead of individual national policies.

At the European level, European Union Member States implement an EU wide comparative labelling
scheme under the Energy Labelling Directive (2010/30/EU), and MEPS are similarly implemented at
an EU level under the framework provided in the Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC).

The Energy Star program developed in the US has a number of international partners66, with
formal arrangements established with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the European Union, the
European Free Trade Association (covering Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), Switzerland,
Canada and Taiwan. The purpose of the arrangements with these partners is to promote specific
Energy Star qualified products in those markets.

In addition, countries can also participate in regional programs with others, whilst still
implementing their own policies at a national level. An example of this is the Barrier Removal to
the Cost-Effective Development and Implementation of Energy Efficiency Standards and Labelling
(BRESL) project67, which is sponsored by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and
the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The participants are Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Pakistan,
Thailand and Vietnam. The aim is to increase the adoption, harmonization and implementation
of energy standards and labelling in Asia to promote the use of energy efficient products. The
project is focused on the following products: refrigerators, room air conditioners, electric motors,
ballasts for fluorescent lighting, electric fans, compact fluorescent lamps and rice cookers.

      Similarly, in the Economic Community of West African States68 (ECOWAS), support has been
      provided to help the development of a regional standards and labelling scheme for its member
      countries. The ECOWAS Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE)69
      and the Super-efficient Equipment and Appliance Deployment (SEAD)70 initiative have been
      working together to help develop plans for a regional standards and label program that will
      contribute to achieving the goals set by the ECOWAS Energy Efficiency Policy. As part of the
      project an assessment of the institutional and regulatory framework for the ECOWAS appliance
      standards and labelling program has been undertaken, which includes recommendations on
      policy, legal and regulatory aspects, program design, implementation and enforcement, and the
      institutional framework71.

      Examples of standards and labelling
      This section provides some further examples of the different types of standards and labelling.

      As noted above, prescriptive requirements are rarely used, but could include for example that a
      particular inefficient technology cannot be used. However, the focus is usually on technology neutral
      policies to avoid limiting innovation, therefore the phase out of inefficient technologies is often
      achieved by setting minimum energy performance requirements. In practice, this means that certain
      technologies can no longer be used because they cannot meet the minimum requirements.

      Class average schemes are also less common, with the main current example being the Top
      Runner program in Japan. The Top Runner standards are set by identifying the most efficient
      models of different sizes and types of products on the market for a given product type, which
      acts as a benchmark to set an average efficiency target. Manufacturers, including importers then
      have to meet that target by a given date. This is achieved by ensuring the average efficiency of all
      their appliances (sales weighted) meets the target efficiency level. There is no minimum efficiency
      requirement set at the individual product model level, but penalties can be imposed if the average
      target efficiency is not achieved.

The more detailed examples below focus on minimum energy performance standards (MEPS)
and comparative and endorsement labels, as these are the main types of standards and labelling
currently implemented. These examples are for illustrative purposes only and other sources
provide further details on the use of standards and labelling across a wider range of countries72.



  Case study 10: The China Energy Label (Comparative Label)

  The China Energy Label (CEL) was launched in 2005, and is aimed at transforming the
  Chinese market towards highly efficient appliances. Administration of the program is
  undertaken by the China Energy Label Center (CELC), part of the China National Institution
  of Standardization (CNIS).

  The label provides product information for consumers, including government, enterprises
  and individuals, across a range of products to help them make purchasing decisions by
  guiding them towards energy efficient equipment. It is a comparative label, with a series
  of efficiency grades used to indicate a product’s performance. The CEL covers over thirty
  product categories including home appliances, office supplies, industrial equipment and
  lighting. Examples include: motors, air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, gas
  kettles, photocopiers, air compressors and flat-screen televisions.

  The CEL is a mandatory labelling program with China’s Energy Conservation Law, Product
  Quality Law and Regulations on Certification and Accreditation forming its legal basis.
  Implementation rules for each product category set out key requirements, such as the label
  format, testing requirements, including relevant test standards that must be used, and
  verification requirements. Verification is undertaken by third part organizations approved by
  the CEL. A separate specification outlines the minimum allowable values of energy efficiency
  and energy efficiency grades for the label for each product category.

      Case study 11: PROCEL Seal in Brazil (Endorsement Label)

      The Programa Nacional de Conservacao de Energia Eletrica (PROCEL) Seal is a voluntary
      endorsement label established in 1993. The scheme falls under the remit of the Ministry of
      Mines and Energy, with implementation managed by Eletrobrás, who are a major electric
      utilities company.

      The aim of the scheme is to stimulate manufacturers to make more efficient products and
      influence consumer purchasing decisions by guiding them to the most energy efficient
      products. It covers a range of products including fluorescent and high intensity discharge
      lamps, electric motors (3-phase general-purpose motors) and pumps (electrical centrifugal
      pumps) alongside other domestic/residential type products.

      A regulation has been established for awarding the energy saving PROCEL Seal, the
      requirements of which, together with the specifications developed for each product group,
      must be met before the Seal is awarded to a product. The specifications are determined by
      testing in a laboratory the range of efficiency of products available on the market to identify
      the level at which products should be awarded the Seal. This approach enables the Seal
      only to be awarded to products with the highest energy efficiency when compared to the
      rest of the market. A handbook is also available, which provides practical information for
      manufacturers on the use of the PROCEL Seal logo.

      This is just one of several standards and labelling policies implemented in Brazil, which also
      include a comparative energy label and minimum energy performance standards.

   Case study 12: Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) in
   Ghana

   Energy Performance Standards were first developed in Ghana in 2000 following work
   between CLASP73, the Ghana Energy Foundation and the Ministry of Mines and Energy
   to establish Ghana’s Electrical Appliance Labelling and Standards Program. The work was
   supported by the United Nations Foundation (UNF) and the United States Agency for
   International Development (USAID).

   An important aspect of the work was to develop energy performance standards for products
   to help encourage consumers to purchase efficient products, but also ensure the market
   was not used to sell obsolete and inefficient products. Given the resources available, key
   decisions were made concerning product choices, with the initial focus on air conditioning
   due to its impact on peak power demand and consequential blackouts. The regulation for air
   conditioning was enacted in 2002.

   The standard for air conditioning is estimated to save Ghana’s consumers and businesses an
   average of $64 million annually in reduced bills and is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by
   2.8 million tonnes over 30 years. This success has resulted in standards being developed for
   other products, including lighting (CFL and incandescent lamps) and refrigerators/freezers. In
   addition, Ghana has subsequently developed a comparative energy label to complement the
   energy performance standards.

      Case study 13: The Energy Efficiency Label and Standard Program in
      South Korea (Comparative Label and MEPS)

      The Energy Efficiency Label and Standard Program in South Korea was introduced in 1992 to
      target products with high energy consumption and now covers over 30 product categories.
      This includes lighting, air conditioning, commercial refrigeration, 3-phase induction motors,
      gas water heaters and transformers. The framework for the program is the responsibility of
      Ministry of Knowledge Economy, while implementation and monitoring is the responsibility
      of the Korean Energy Management Corporation (KEMCO).

      The labelling aspect of the program established an energy label with five grades, with
      “1” representing the highest efficiency and “5” the poorest. It is mandatory for products
      covered by the program to display which energy efficiency grade they meet, with the aim
      of encouraging consumers to purchase high efficient products. It also aims to promote
      innovation amongst manufacturers by using energy efficiency (grade 1) as a target energy
      performance standard. This means that when initially established no products should meet
      grade 1, with the intention being that this will stimulate the marketing of products with a
      higher efficiency than currently found on the market.

      The minimum energy performance standard is enforced by not permitting products that fall
      below the lowest energy efficiency grade in the labelling to be placed on the market. The
      energy performance standards are typically updated every 3-5 years to ensure they continue
      to drive improvements.

      In addition to the Energy Efficient Label and Standard program, South Korea also operates
      a high-efficiency appliance certification program and the e-standby program, both of which
      are voluntary endorsement labels.

Summary of key standards and labelling types
In summary, there are various types of regulatory standards and labelling:
•	 Standards:
    –	 Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS);
    –	 Prescriptive features; and
    –	 Class average.

The most commonly used types of regulatory standards are MEPS, with prescriptive features and
class average standards being much less common. This is due to a desire to apply technology
neutral approaches to regulatory policies and because of the extra complexity in developing and
enforcing class average requirements.

MEPS tend to be mandatory and set a minimum requirement for the market in order to
eliminate the most inefficient products. It is also common for requirements to be phased-in,
with increasingly stringent efficiency levels being introduced over time to allow manufacturers
sufficient time to react.

•	 Labelling:
   –	 Comparative labels; and
   –	 Endorsement labels.

Comparative labelling is generally introduced to target consumer behavior regarding a particular
product group through providing relevant information on the efficiency of the product in the
group and thereby influencing purchasing decisions. Comparative labels are generally aimed at
the whole market and are often introduced on a voluntary basis initially in order to prepare the
market for them becoming mandatory at some future point. Labelling is also often implemented
alongside MEPS.

In contrast, endorsement labels tend to be focused on giving recognition to the best performing
products in particular categories when evaluated against a series of assessment criteria.
Endorsement label schemes tend to be voluntary.

      Introduction
      Energy consumption varies across different sectors, and it is common for standards and labelling
      to target those sectors and products with high energy consumption. The key sectors will vary
      depending on the industrial landscape of a country and the available opportunities to implement
      energy efficiency measures. Common product groups relevant to industrial sectors and which
      often form part of standards and labelling schemes include:
      •	 Industrial boilers
      •	 Electrical transformers
      •	 Electric Motors
      •	 Industrial fans and blowers
      •	 Lighting
      •	 Professional / industrial refrigeration

      This section provides an overview of each of these product groups to illustrate the energy saving
      opportunities that may be available and how they are dealt with by existing standards and
      labelling schemes.

      Industrial boilers
      Overview of the technology
      Boilers are very common items of plant used to generate steam or hot water for use in a range of
      industrial sectors. This includes energy intensive sectors such as paper, food processing, chemicals,
      metals and the petroleum refining industry74. Nearly all industrial sites will have a boiler system of
      some type. For example, in the United States there are an estimated 43,000 industrial boiler units,
      with these representing 82% of total US boiler capacity and the energy consumption of industrial
      boilers accounting for 37% of total industrial energy consumption (some 6,823 PJ/year)75. Steam
      boilers are also used in electricity generation from certain fuels.

The fuels used in industrial boilers varies, and include coal, oil, natural gas and biomass.
According to the IEA’s Energy Technology Network, industrial boilers running on coal, oil, natural
gas and biomass can reach efficiencies of 85%, 80%, 75% and 70% respectively. Throughout
industrialized countries natural gas is the predominant primary fuel, with over 50% of boilers
using gas compared to other fuels75. In addition, a significant proportion (estimated at around
75%) of the existing boilers installed in industrialized countries are believed to be over 30 years
old, therefore offering considerable scope for replacement with more efficient modern designs.

Energy Efficiency Opportunities
Research on steam boilers in Europe to support the implementation of the Ecodesign Directive
has identified key areas at the product level that can improve the energy efficiency of industrial
boilers, including:
•	 Economizers to preheat the feed water by recovering heat from flue gases;
•	 Air preheaters to transfer heat from flue gases to the air entering the burner;
•	 Combustion control to optimize efficiency through reducing energy losses; and
•	 Variable Speed Drives to reduce electricity consumption of associated pumps and fans.

      In addition, other measures such as improved maintenance and sound operation of the
      equipment can help improve efficiency, although these are aimed at the use phase of the plant
      rather than its actual design.

      The study in support of the European Ecodesign Directive74 indicated that the stock of steam
      boilers in Europe is approximately 71,000. Savings based on a scenario of mandatory eco-design
      requirements indicate for 2030 a reduction in primary (fuel) energy consumption of 0.7% (or
      8TWh) compared to business as usual. For electrical energy consumption (translated to primary
      energy) there is a 13% reduction as a result of the mandatory eco-design requirements scenario
      in 2030 when compared to business as usual.

      Existing Standards and Labelling Schemes for Industrial Boilers
      There are various existing standards and labelling schemes for boilers, a selection of which are
      shown in Table 10 below76.

      Electrical transformers
      Overview of the technology
      A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits
      through electromagnetic induction. They are mainly used to change the voltages of alternating
      current (AC) in electric power applications. They are essential for the AC transmission, distribution
      and utilization of electrical energy.

      Transformers vary in size from less than a cubic centimeter to units weighing hundreds of tons,
      for example those interconnecting the power grid. Common types of transformers found in
      industry include, but are not limited to, low-voltage dry type, low-voltage control power, medium-
      voltage dry-type, medium-voltage pad-mount oil filled, medium-voltage pad-mount gas filled and
      medium voltage power oil filled.

Energy Efficiency Opportunities
The efficiency of transformers is affected by energy losses, which comprise:
•	 No-load losses, which result from the magnetic field alternating in the core of the transformer,
   and are constant regardless of the loading of the transformer;
•	 Load losses, which vary depending on the loading of the transformer and include heat losses
   in the transformer windings and conductor eddy current losses; and
•	 Auxiliary losses, which arise through the use of energy to operate cooling fans or pumps
   within the transformer.

Opportunities to improve the efficiency of transformers therefore address these areas to reduce
energy losses. Typically, energy efficiency can be improved through changes in the balance of
materials used within the transformer, for example as a result of the mix between using more
material, higher grade steel, amorphous steel, and replacing aluminum with copper windings.
A balance needs to be achieved in terms of increasing environmental impact due to increased
material use, and the reduced impact achieved by the improved energy efficiency.

Life-cycle costs also need to be considered. A study on transformers in support of the Ecodesign
Directive in Europe77 highlighted in its analysis that the best available technology does not always
correlate with lower life-cycle costs due to the improvements in efficiency being insufficient to
offset the increase in the capital costs for the most efficient models.

Nevertheless, significant economic and environmental benefits with respect to improved energy
efficiency of transformers, which can be driven by standards and labelling schemes have been
identified. For example, the US Department of Energy has estimated that the newly amended
energy efficiency standards for distribution transformers, beginning in 2016, will save up to
$12.9 billion for consumers and around a 1 million GWh of energy for equipment sold between
2016 and 2045. The US DOE has also estimated an avoidance of about 265 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of about
52 million automobiles.

      Electric Motors
      Overview of the technology
      Electric motors convert electrical power into mechanical power. They can be categorized into
      small (<0.75 kW), mid-range (0.75 – 375 kW) and large (>375 kW), and are used for a wide
      range of applications in all sectors. Electricity consumption by motors is highest in mid-range
      motors, which are commonly used for industrial purposes, with asynchronous alternating current
      (AC) induction motors the most frequently used79.




      Motors can be sold as standalone items, which users then incorporate into their own
      applications, or motors can be integrated by manufacturers into other products, such as
      machine tools, pumps, fans and compressors. Large electric motors are also used for industrial
      applications, however in contrast with mid-range motors, these tend to be bespoke and custom
      designed for a specific site application.

Energy Efficiency Opportunities
The use of electric motors in industry dominates overall motor electricity consumption, with mid-
range motors accounting for the largest proportion. With electric motor driven systems estimated
to account for 43-46% of all global electricity consumption, resulting in 6,040 million tonnes of
CO2 emissions78, it is a key area to consider for standards and labelling schemes.

In addition to the use of inherently more efficient models of motor, there are a number of areas
that can be considered to help improve the efficiency of electric motor systems:
•	 Significant gains can be made by motors that can adapt motor speed and torque to variable
    loads using variable speed drives (VSDs), which significantly reduce partial load losses.
•	 The correct sizing of the motor to the intended load, as below 50% load motor efficiency can
    be significantly reduced.
•	 Correct operation and maintenance are also key to reducing losses, for example reducing idle
    time, avoiding fast starts and overloading, and proper lubrication and replacement of gears.
•	 Integration and optimization of the motor with the system it forms part of, for example,
    with efficient end use equipment such as pumps, fans, compressors etc. will help minimize
    energy losses.

A lack of awareness of the life-cycle costs associated with motors is a common barrier to more
efficient solutions being implemented. The slightly higher costs of more efficient motors available
on the market is usually offset by the reduced energy consumption costs, as typically 95% of the
total life cycle costs for a motor can be attributed to the electricity it uses.

By 2030, potential savings from the use of industrial electric motors through the implementation
of best practice MEPS by all countries globally are estimated at 322 TWh of annual electricity
demand, or a saving of 206 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. Significantly greater savings would
be achievable if all motor driven systems were properly optimized across the system as a whole.
For example, by moving to the least life-cycle cost level as soon as technically possible, it is
estimated that 42,000 TWh of electricity demand, 29 Gt of CO2 emissions and USD 2.8 trillion in
electricity costs would be saved globally by 203078. To date standards and labelling have usually
been applied to the motors themselves; applying them to motor systems to achieve these greater
savings is another challenge.

Fans and Blowers
Overview of the technology
Fans and blowers are equipment used for industrial applications to provide a circulation of air.
There are two main types of fan81:
•	 Centrifugal fans are the most commonly used type of fan for industrial applications and are
   capable of generating high pressures with high efficiencies. Blade types can vary and include;
   forward curved, radial-blade, radial-tip, backward-inclined, backward curved and aerofoil.
•	 Axial fans create aerodynamic lift through propeller blades creating an air stream parallel to
   the axis of the fan. Types include propeller, tubeaxial and vaneaxial.

Fans are commonly used in a range of industrial applications, including heating, cooling,
ventilation, air circulation, blowing and drying, as part of building ventilation, industrial processes,
IT equipment ventilation and vehicle ventilation. It is common for fans to be part of a larger
system; for example, nearly all types of fans for air conditioning and ventilation are driven by

      electric motors, with integrated products increasingly common for non-residential building
      ventilation. Common product types include roof fans, air extraction fans, air handling units and
      boxed fans. Other elements of the wider system can include control systems, drive systems,
      ducting or pipework, filters, diffusers, flow controllers and in some cases heat exchangers.

      Energy Efficiency Opportunities
      The environmental impact of fans is dominated by the use phase, and arises as a result of the
      energy consumption during the operation of the fan and should therefore be the focus for
      improving the environmental performance of industrial fans. Fans and the systems of which they
      are part offer a number of areas for energy efficiency improvements.

      Previous research82 has suggested significant improvements of up to a 30% reduction in total fan
      input power that can be achieved by better selection of fans, their transmissions, their motors
      and their controls and the better design of the wider systems. It is not just the peak efficiency
      of the fan that is important, but the optimal selection and matching of the various components
      comprising a fan system. High part load efficiencies are also important, since heating and cooling
      requirements change throughout the year.

Additional information on energy saving opportunities for industrial fans is available from The
Energy Efficiency Exchange website, which is a joint initiative of Australian State and Territory
Governments83, which includes advice on reducing the demand for fans, optimizing systems and
selecting the correct type of fan system.

Existing Standards and Labelling Schemes for Fans and Blowers
Currently, the scope of MEPS for fans are predominately focused on comfort/ceiling fans and
residential ventilation units/fans rather than industrial fans. Two main exceptions are in Europe,
where there is an Ecodesign Regulation for non-residential fans, and in China, where the
regulatory scope is comparable to the EU legislation. Furthermore, the CLASP database84 identifies
other standards and labelling under the industrial sector for China and Iran, with the indication
that standards and labelling in this area are under development in the US and Jordan.

Lighting
Overview of Technology
Lighting is used across all sectors, which for general lighting can include residential, office, retail,
industrial, hospitality, outdoor and architectural. It is estimated that lighting accounts for approximately
15% of total electricity consumption and 5 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions85.

Typical industrial lighting applications include general lighting for production, assembly and
storage spaces in factories, warehouses, indoor sporting areas and halls. This includes downlights,
linear lights, spotlights high/low bay lights and task lighting.

The four main types of lighting available are:
•	 Filament lamps (incandescent, tungsten halogen)
•	 Discharge lamps (fluorescent, compact fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID))
•	 Solid State Lighting lamps (LED, OLED)
•	 Induction lamps

      The general lighting market has undergone significant transformation in recent years, with a
      move from a market dominated by incandescent lighting to more energy efficient products, which
      is increasingly LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology. Legislation introduced in various regions
      across the world is effectively banning the sale of the least efficient products, while newer, more
      efficient technology is decreasing in price. Increasing electricity prices have also driven the need
      for more efficient products, as businesses and householders look to reduce their energy costs.

      Energy Efficiency Opportunities
      The use stage continues to result in the largest impacts from lighting as a result of energy
      consumption. In terms of energy efficient lighting, research highlights the importance of the
      complete lighting system, including the luminaire (fitting plus lamp) and lighting control. Key
      parameters contributing towards overall high efficiency and cost effectiveness include luminous
      efficacy, lifetime, eliminating early failures and dimming.

      Although the general trend in lighting technology is towards the increased use of LED technology,
      this is slowest in the industrial sector compared to other sectors such as residential, offices,
      shops, and hospitality, with LEDs accounting for 4% of global industrial sector lighting in 2011,
      with future market shares forecast at 20% and 40% for 2016 and 2020 respectively84. This is
      on account of application-specific reasons along with existing widely used technologies (high
      frequency fluorescent and HID) having high-efficacy performance, limiting the cost-benefit of
      adopting LED equipment. Such variations in the market at the sector level would be important
      to take into account when developing a standards and labelling scheme for lighting. The pace
      of change in lighting technology is also very rapid with new products being introduced almost
      continuously.

Professional / Industrial Refrigeration
Overview of the Technology
Professional (or industrial) refrigeration equipment includes a range of products, with key types
covered by standards and labelling as follows:
•	 Professional storage cabinets
•	 Blast cabinets
•	 Walk in cold rooms
•	 Process chillers

Storage cabinets, blast cabinets and walk in cold rooms, which are professional refrigeration
appliances, are used to store food, but are not used for the direct displaying and selling of
food to consumers – thereby distinguishing them from ‘commercial’ products. Key applications
include supermarkets, groceries, butchers, restaurants, hotels, industrial facilities and professional
kitchens for example in schools, hospitals, and canteens.

Process chillers are used in a wide range of applications, for example to cool water for air-
conditioning plants or units within industrial processes where cooling of liquids is required, for
example food and drink production and processing, and in the chemical sector. Process chillers
can be further categorized at low, medium and high temperature.

Energy Efficiency Opportunities
The main impacts from professional refrigeration as a result of energy consumption in the use
phase, and direct greenhouse impacts from energy use and from refrigerants.

In terms of improvements to the energy performance of professional refrigeration equipment, a
reduction in energy consumption in the use phase of between 10-20% can be achieved through the
implementation of a range of measures. These include the following as appropriate for the different
types of professional refrigeration: high efficiency compressors / Variable Speed Drive compressors,
sealing door frames, efficient fan blades, efficient motors for evaporator and condenser fans, thicker
insulation, defrost control, remote condensing, electronic expansion values, strip door curtains,
automatic door closure, efficient lighting, defrost control and improved heat exchangers.

It is noted that many of these improvements are focused at the component level of the
refrigeration appliances, and need to be implemented in combination to maximize savings.

      18.	Assessing the context and key steps to
           developing and implementing a standards
           and labelling scheme

      Assessing the country context in relation to the introduction of a standards and labelling scheme
      can be complex and will depend on the circumstances of the country in relation to a range of
      factors, including:
      •	 the existence or establishment of an appropriate policy and legislative framework,
      •	 existing policies and standards and labelling schemes that already affect the country,
      •	 the availability of data, resources and funding, and
      •	 the willingness of key stakeholders to engage.

      This section describes the key steps, which are illustrated in Figure 22, and highlights the main
      elements to consider when assessing the need for a standards and labelling scheme, and when
      developing a scheme once the decision has been made to implement. The information is of
      course not exhaustive as there may well be additional technology and country specific aspects to
      consider.

      The initial steps ensure that before a standards and labelling scheme is developed it:
      •	 is clear that such a scheme is required;
      •	 targets the correct product areas; and
      •	 has the necessary legal basis and institutional support.

      The outcome of these steps will be a detailed diagnostic of the particular country’s current
      situation and recommendations on what could be implemented with quantified potential
      outcomes.

      Subsequent steps then address the details of the scheme’s development and design, launch,
      implementation and enforcement. The final step is evaluation of the scheme, with the results of
      this feeding back into the development and design process by way of revisions where appropriate.

Tools
For each steps a number of tools have been included                         Targeting
in this module to assist the practitioner.

•	 Firstly, there are checklists for each stage, which
                                                                         Institutional and
   summarize the key points that need to be
                                                                       policy considerations
   considered when developing a standards and
   labelling scheme. These will help the practitioner in
   discussions with stakeholders and in understanding
   the issues that are relevant for the particular                        Development
   country.                                                                and Design
•	 Secondly, examples of the scope of work for
   different support activities are included, which can
   be incorporated into terms of reference (ToR) when
   commissioning support from consultants.
                                                                              Launch
•	 Thirdly, references to other tools and information
   that are available from other sources.
                                                                         Implementation
It is important to note that the scopes of work                          and enforcement
provided are only examples, and these will need to
be tailored as appropriate to reflect the status and
circumstances of the country in question. In addition
to a scope of works, a ToR will normally need also                        Evaluation and
to include background and context, assignment                                Revision

      The background and context for the terms of reference will vary between countries, but typically
      could include information on the following aspects:
      •	 Background on the drivers for the work in the country; for example, rising population,
         poor resource efficiency, increasing fuel demands and fuel security. High-level statistics to
         characterize energy use within the country and in particular for the industrial sector can
         provide additional context.
      •	 Identification of recent work related to the ToR; this may include work undertaken by the
         country’s government or other national/regional organizations, or in conjunction with external
         organizations or implementation partners, including the World Bank Group.
      •	 Wider context of the work, for example if other projects forming part of a wider framework,
         are also been considered and how they link to the standards and labelling activity.

      The assignment objectives will vary depending on the circumstances, but examples are included
      together within the scopes of works later in this Module. Deliverables will also vary, depending
      on the scope of work, but typically will be in the form of reports, presentations, guidance, draft
      regulations and the delivery of workshops.

Step One: Diagnose the current situation
The first step concerns obtaining an understanding of the current state of play regarding key
aspects, including:
•	 What are the drivers for a standards and labelling scheme, including key areas of energy
   consumption at the national level;
•	 What existing standards and labelling schemes are in place or have been considered, including
   relevant national and regional schemes; and
•	 Identification of key stakeholders relevant to the development of standards and labelling.

Reviewing this type of information will provide relevant background information to contextualize
a potential scheme within the policy framework of the country being supported. This will help
inform subsequent steps and decision making.

In addition to the activities covered in this section, parallel activities identified in Step 3:
Institutional, policy and regulatory considerations will be important at the early stage of
considering a standards and labelling scheme. This will include for example, identifying the
institutional home for the standards and labelling scheme.

What are the drivers – understanding energy consumption and existing
policies
This stage focuses on understanding the drivers for energy and resource efficiency and potentially
the development of a standards and labelling scheme. A key element of this is a sound
appreciation of the context of energy production and consumption within a country and the
existing relevant policy and regulatory landscape.

The main focus for practitioners will be on government regulatory programs. There is a need
to identify and then quantify what the country is currently working towards. From the policy
viewpoint, what goals have been set and the timeframe to achieve them? This is equally relevant
for an industry or utility company led initiative to understand how a standards and labelling
scheme would contribute to an overall policy target.




                 3 IMPLEMENTATION                                      4 STANDARDS                   195
      Any existing regulatory drivers aimed at energy efficiency should be identified; this may include
      industrial sector or product specific aspects. Existing wider instruments that may influence
      energy demand or the markets for energy efficient products, such as public procurement rules or
      subsidies should be identified.

      Any regional or international policy initiatives that countries need to take into account should also
      be identified. For example in Europe many policies related to energy are driven by requirements at
      the European level, and work by international programs, such as The Super-efficient Equipment
      and Appliance Deployment (SEAD)88 initiative may also act as a driver.

      It is important to understand this wider policy landscape and the drivers for it as any standards
      and labelling scheme should complement and align with existing policies and drivers.

      Energy demand, national production and energy security are at the heart of an energy efficiency
      policy and are the key drivers behind the implementation of many standards and labelling
      schemes. It is therefore useful to review and understand the dynamics of the country in terms of
      energy requirements. Other reasons for implementing standards and labelling schemes include
      greenhouse gas abatement, economic efficiency and trade agreements and/or alignment.

      It will be useful to understand the current energy consumption in the country, broken down by
      economic and industry sector, as well as understanding energy generation within the country.
      This will be relevant to understand how a standards and labelling scheme will help tackle the
      challenge of energy efficiency and quantify what it can achieve and/or needs to achieve within
      the context of the relevant issues identified. For example, is the country trying to stabilize current
      energy usage, avoid the need for new energy supplies, limit dependency etc.

      Energy production, including energy import, and export play a key role in the success of an
      economy. Many developing countries struggle with energy supply, which in turn can hinder
      economic growth. At this stage, there is a need to identify:
      •	 Total energy generated (if any) and how much of it is used at the national level and how much
         is exported (including the revenue generated).
      •	 Total energy imported and associated cost.

•	 What are the current energy supply problems faced by the country: power cuts, high energy
   prices, subsidized energy prices?
•	 How does the above translate in terms of GHG emissions and any international commitments
   made?

This information will help secure buy in for a standards and labelling scheme, and in determining
its impact on energy production (or imports) and savings realized.

In addition to production, understanding energy consumption is of key importance. This stage is
focused on understanding what the local context is in term of the national energy consumption
broken down by primary energy sources, in order to establish past trends and future forecasts (as
Figure 23 shows for Egypt as an example).

      It is then a case of drilling down into the detail to understand which sectors of the economy are
      the most energy intensive; see Figure 24.

      Once key sectors are identified, further investigation into the processes and products that result in
      high consumption is undertaken in Step 2: Targeting a standards and labelling program, building
      on this initial information. Depending on the level of data available, a series of assumptions
      may be required to help estimate energy consumption at the more detailed level. It is important
      to note that standards and labelling schemes tend to focus on accessible cost effective energy
      savings, therefore the most energy intensive parts of the economy may not necessarily be
      the most appropriate areas to focus on, depending on the scope of the scheme and saving
      opportunities. This is addressed further in Step 2.

Finally, it will be important to understand the drivers that are leading to growing energy demand.
This can be due, for example, to:
•	 Economic development, leading to the growth in ownership and usage of energy using
   equipment;
•	 Population growth;
•	 Increased energy intensive industrial activities;
•	 An increase in transport and/ or car ownership (private or commercial transport);
•	 Energy prices (this could be linked to the implementation of heavy subsidies to specific sectors
   or general subsidies).

The example below from Egypt illustrates how these drivers were considered and the type of information
that can be gathered, for example the contribution of industrial energy consumption, to help inform the
decision making process when considering implementing a standards and labelling scheme.



  Egypt – drivers for energy efficiency
  In Egypt, a growing population and ongoing economic development especially within energy
  intensive industrial activities have led the country to change from being an oil and gas exporter
  to a net importer. This has a double impact: reduced income for the Government from oil
  revenue, and uncertainty faced due to energy shortages, increasing energy prices, and foreign
  energy dependence. These have the potential to reduce the rate of economic growth.

  It was estimated that the industrial sector consumed 44% of the energy produced and was
  therefore a key target sector for the introduction of energy efficiency measures, including
  consideration of standards and labelling schemes.

      Review of current standards and labelling activities
      Standards and labeling initiatives or schemes can take many forms. The practitioner should review
      what current standards and labelling activities are operational, or what might have been operational
      in the past, at the national or regional level. At this stage, the practitioner should refer back to
      the findings from Module 2 regarding the regulatory analysis, which should have identified any
      regulations that would be driving or underpinning standards and labelling activities (mandatory
      ones). In addition, activities in Step 3, which may be undertaken in parallel to these earlier steps
      where appropriate, will be important to identify the underlying legislative framework under which a
      standards and labelling scheme might be implemented. The CLASP database, which lists worldwide
      standards and labelling activities by product groups, can be useful for this step – see box.



                     CLASP Database Tool




        The CLASP Standards and Labelling Database is a publicly available tool that enables
        practitioners to search for standards and labelling by product group and country. Initial search
        results can then be filtered further by standard and labelling type, more specific products,
        policy type, policy status, and whether they are voluntary or mandatory. Information provided
        includes policy type, policy status and most recent effective date.

        The tool can be accessed from: http://clasp.ngo/en/Tools/Tools/SL_Search

      Stakeholder identification
      Understanding the relevant stakeholders and their roles will also be key to understanding the
      current situation regarding existing standards and labelling schemes, but also to identify the key
      stakeholders to involve in successfully developing and implementing a new or amended scheme.
      Stakeholders that may be relevant to consider include:

      •	 Ministries with responsibility for energy, environment, commerce and industry, finance and
         taxation
      •	 National or regional standards bodies
      •	 National test laboratories (if any)
      •	 Industry trade organizations (these could be numerous and include those manufacturing/
         supplying products and those buying/using them)
      •	 Chambers of commerce
      •	 Utility companies / trade associations
      •	 Environmental organizations, e.g. NGOs
      •	 International aid agencies / donor agencies
      •	 Regional co-operation bodies
      •	 Organizations running international initiatives such as SEAD

      Once a list of stakeholders has been identified, a more in-depth understanding of stakeholders
      and their roles can take place. This is best done through a mapping exercise, for example using an
      assessment tool such as that outlined in Map the stakeholders.

This mapping exercise should help you to understand which stakeholders are currently active
and their roles within standards and labelling activities, and identify the key players to involve
in developing and implementing a scheme successfully. For example, a number of government
departments and bodies might have an interest in such a program, but they will also have varying
levels of influence. It is important therefore to understand which have the most influence and get
them fully engaged from the outset. Identifying and engaging with the government ministries and
agencies that have the legal authority to design and implement standards and labelling legislation
and regulations is paramount in ensuring they are fully involved and probably leading the scheme’s
development. This is further covered in Step 3.

When engaging with stakeholders it is important to understand the benefits to them of
involvement, as this will help bring the various groups on-board. As an example, shows the benefits
identified for the development of a standards and labelling scheme in Egypt.

The stakeholders identified will be important consultees in the subsequent steps for establishing an
effective standards and labelling scheme.

Step Two: Targeting a standards and labelling 		
program
At this stage, the practitioner will need to gather a number of data sets to determine which
products the scheme should target and focus on, and will build on the wider informtation and data
collected in the previous step.

Data and market analysis will help in understanding the performance of products within the target
market for the prospective scheme, and enable potential opportunities for improvement to be
identified by comparing this to the products available on the wider market. Together with the
understanding of the policy context from Step 1: Diagnose the current situation, this will help to
determine what type of standards and labelling scheme is best suited to the local economy and is
likely to deliver the best energy efficiency outcomes.

The checklist tool below captures the key questions to consider when considering the target areas
for a standards and labelling scheme, with the box providing an example of the impact and savings
identified for standards and labelling for motors in Egypt.

Market      Understand which products to target:
data        FF The process involves understanding how much energy particular
               product groups consume and the potential for improvement. It may not
               necessarily be the case of focusing on the largest energy consumers, with
               the proportion of savings in relation to energy consumed a key factor.
            FF Establish market breakdowns of the sales of different products and their
               energy consumption. This should differentiate between specific products
               within a technology group; for example, electric motors should be
               analyzed by type, size (power) and so forth.
            FF Establish past, present and future trends regarding the purchase of these
               products. Industrial products tend to be purchased/replaced in cycles,
               which is an important factor in understanding how fast the market can
               change and the energy savings that can be realized.
            FF Other data relevant to the market analysis include: regional/international
               market efficiency distributions, the technical feasibility of reaching
               higher energy efficiency levels, the associated incremental production
               and purchase price cost, the affordability to end-users and the life cycle
               cost implications.
            FF By combining the above data, it is possible to establish how fast the
               market could be transformed and the consequent energy savings.
               Market data showing the distribution of products by efficiency may
               not be available at the beginning of a standards and labelling scheme,
               in which case it may be necessary to use proxy data from other, ideally
               similar, economies to help derive initial savings estimates.
            FF Initial potential savings from energy consumption (and energy
               production/ imports too) can be calculated to feed into a cost benefit
               analysis
            FF Tools are available to help with such analysis, for example the CLASP
               Policy Analysis Modelling System (PAMS) tool, see summary below and

      Market      FF   The outputs from such tools and the use of scenario analysis can
      data             be used to help understand and explain the policy implications to
                       stakeholders when establishing MEPS or labelling classes.

      Impact of   FF   There is a need to understand how the market is structured in terms
      standards        of local producers vs global companies as this may influence target
      and              stakeholders.
      labelling   FF   Can local producers cope with a standards and labeling program,
                       what support would they need to ensure their products are compliant
                       (technical training, financial support, capacity building)?
                  FF   Impacts on local industry can be sensitive to whether they design and
                       build all parts of a product, or whether they assemble pre-fabricated
                       and imported components. Determining this will help understanding of
                       the needs of local industry.
                  FF   Access by manufactures to appropriate test laboratories, that usually
                       charge for testing of products, will be an important factor and key
                       for the implementation of a standards and labelling scheme. Further
                       information on this is included in Step 3.

                       a standards and labelling scheme, for example in terms of widening the
                       local producers’ market to a more regional and global one.
                  FF   Consider impacts on importers, agents, retailers (especially within the
                       used and refurbished market).

                       standards, or labelling or both, and whether they will be voluntary or
                       mandatory.

Assessment of potential energy and cost savings, payback and GHG
reduction for Egypt’s efficient motors standards and labeling program
The analysis reported an estimated savings potential of more than 400 million kWh pa of
electricity through the intervention of a standards and labelling program in Egypt and the
resulting displacement of the purchase of standard motors by energy efficient motors from
2018 onwards. The analysis was carried out for a period of four years, from 2018 to 2021.
It was estimated that such an intervention would result in annual monetary savings for the
industrial sector from 35 million USD in 2018 to 70 million USD in 2021. An analysis of the
payback period for replacement of standard motors by energy efficient motors gave a typical
payback period of 1.28 years, thus indicating a highly economically viable option, considering
the average life of motors to be 7.7 years.

To gauge the environmental impact of the standards and labelling program, the reduction
of CO2 equivalent GHG emissions was estimated. The analysis estimated a reduction of CO2
equivalent GHG reduction of 245 thousand tons in 2018, going up to 391, thousand tons in
2021. The program also aims to build institutional and testing capacity in Egypt to support the
standards and labeling program for motors.

                     CLASP Policy Analysis Modelling System (PAMS)




        The CLASP PAMS tool is a publicly available tool that can be used by policymakers to assist
        them in assessing the benefits of standards and labelling schemes and identify the most
        appropriate targets for appliance efficiency levels. This is important when assessing which
        product to target with a standards and labelling scheme, in order to ensure it provides
        maximum benefits in terms of energy savings, and the impact on stakeholders in terms of
        monetary costs and benefits.

        PAMS is an Excel based model, and can be used at a basic level with limited input data, but
        for more accurate results country specific inputs can be added. PAMS has default values for
        150 countries and three appliances, however with appropriate data sets the model can be
        used to assess MEPS for any appliance or equipment type, including industrial equipment.

Step Three: Institutional, policy and regulatory 		
considerations
In parallel with or following the diagnosis of existing standards and labelling schemes and
identification of target product groups, there are a series of key institutional, policy and regulatory
considerations that need to be addressed if a decision has been taken to establish a new
standards and labelling scheme.

These issues are fundamental in ensuring that a framework is established within which the
standards and labelling program can operate successfully and promote the market transformation
of the energy efficiency of selected equipment and appliances. This includes aspects related to key
stakeholder support, resourcing, roles and responsibilities, supporting mechanisms (in particular
related to product test standards and testing capacity), consultation processes and alignment with
other regulations.

Establishing a sound institutional structure is vital for an effective standards and labelling scheme.
Critical factors include the identification of the government body that has the legal authority to
design and implement standards and labelling legislation and regulations, and that it leads the
scheme’s development. Other ministries and agencies with critical responsibilities needed for the
successful design and implementation also need to be successfully engaged and motivated to
support the initiative. This will build and link into the stakeholder mapping in Step 1, with key
implementation roles including: control of products entering the country; surveillance of products
placed on the market; control of retailers; certification and conformity assessment; development
of test standards; creation of stable funding for the program; awareness raising and promotional
activities; industrial support; complementary incentives; and negotiation of trade alignment
aspects. This needs to be done with full consultation across the various parties to ensure there is
clarity on roles and responsibilities and the necessary levels of support.

      and labelling scheme has been made.

      issues that should be considered.

        Topic                  Considerations

        Key                    FF   Understanding the current situation will help establish the level
        stakeholder                 of political engagement and support that exists and whether this
        support                     needs to be enhanced.
                               FF   The support of key policy makers is vital for the successful
                                    implementation of a standards and labelling scheme – the political
                                    will must exist.
                               FF   This needs to include policy makers across all countries where a
                                    regional scheme is considered.
                               FF   Support from other stakeholders, for example manufacturers and
                                    trade associations will also be important, particularly where the
                                    scheme is not operated by government.

        Capacity               FF   In addition to key stakeholder support, there is the need for
                                    sufficient resources and capacity to be made available, not just for
                                    the setting up of the scheme, but also to ensure effective ongoing
                                    implementation and enforcement.

Topic              Considerations

Establishment      FF   Any existing legislative framework, such as energy efficiency or
of regional             conservation laws, consumer laws, environmental laws etc. under
and national            which the standards and labelling scheme might be implemented
regulatory              need to be identified and assessed in terms suitability to identify
frameworks for          any gaps in the framework that need to be addressed.
implementation     FF   A clear and transparent framework for establishing the scheme
as appropriate          needs to be established. This needs to outline how the scheme will
                        be implemented, including aspects such as establishing relevant
                        institutional bodies and key roles and responsibilities.
                   FF   This will include providing the mandate for the relevant
                        instructional bodies or government department/organization
                        to develop and revise product specific requirements in terms of
                        standards and labelling. This will include aspects such as evidence
                        gathering, stakeholder consultation and the regulatory process for
                        adopting standards and labelling.
                   FF   The extent of the framework required may depend on the type of
                        standards and labelling scheme proposed; a voluntary endorsement
                        label will require less of a regulatory approach than a mandatory
                        MEPS and comparative labelling scheme.

Test standards     FF   Test standards are a key element of standards and labelling
and procedures          schemes, as they enable products to be tested and then compared
                        on a like for like basis.
                   FF   Given that product development is increasingly international,
                        alignment with international test standards used by key trading
                        partners would be appropriate and reduces barriers to the
                        introduction of the latest technologies to the local market.
                   FF   Alignment with international test standards used in established
                        standards and labelling schemes will also mean information
                        and analysis previously undertaken can be used to inform the
                        development of a scheme.

         Topic                         Considerations

         Test standards                FF   Existing national test standards will also need to be considered to
         and procedures                     avoid any conflict with international test standards that might be
                                            adopted.
                                       FF   The choice of which test standards to use may depend on the
                                            products targeted and nature of their markets, e.g. whether they
                                            are generally national or international.

         Testing capacity              FF   Requiring the use of particular test standards needs to be aligned
                                            with the availability of testing capacity; are there existing suitable
                                            test facilities within the country, or would these need to be
                                            developed?
                                       FF   Establishing new test facilities in a country will take time and
                                            resources, including funding. The nature of test facilities will
                                            depend on the products covered by the standards and labelling
                                            scheme and testing to be undertaken as part of the verification
                                            process. Further information on setting up test laboratories is
                                            available from the IEC90.
                                       FF   If international test standards are used and the market for the
                                            targeted products is international, then testing capacities in other
                                            countries may be used. This could reduce the cost, effort and
                                            schedule for setting up the standards and labelling scheme.
                                       FF   For a regional standards and labelling scheme, the testing capacity
                                            should be considered at the regional level, rather than the
                                            individual participating countries.
                                       FF   Setting up test facilities may require international verification
                                            to confirm testing is undertaken in accordance with required
                                            standards. This is a further cost to consider.

Topic              Considerations

Regulating         FF   The sale and purchase of used goods often requires much lower
used (second            investment, and is therefore an attractive option to purchasers,
hand) goods             particularly in low-income markets. However, the performance
                        of second hand products needs to be considered within a wider
                        context to ensure this does not compromise energy efficiency and
                        therefore overall energy consumption.
                   FF   The impact of used products can be understood by considering
                        the life cycle costs, where the energy cost savings of a more
                        efficient product offset a higher initial outlay. Communicating this
                        benefit and the payback periods will help reinforce the aims of the
                        standards and labelling scheme.
                   FF   Low cost, but poor efficiency second hand products could
                        undermine the scheme’s aims. The impact of limiting inefficient
                        second hand products should therefore be considered, especially
                        where the products are relevant to low income markets. Some form
                        of loan support may be required to facilitate the initial additional
                        investment needed in new, more efficient products.
                   FF   Controlling the import of less efficient second hand goods is also
                        an important consideration, particular where payback periods of
                        efficient models are relatively high. This could be done through
                        regulation on imports of particular second hand equipment.

                     practices within [insert country] in order to identify potential opportunities to
                     improve the energy efficiency of industrial sectors.

        Scope of work
        1.	 Overview of industrial sector – The Consultant will provide an overview of the industrial
            sector for [insert country/region]. This should include an overview of the country’s economy,
            the industrial sector’s role within the economy, for example GDP contribution, a breakdown
            of industrial sector sub-categories.

        2.	 Policy Analysis – The Consultant will identify and analyze existing and planned policy
            measures related to energy efficiency. This should include country, regional and sector
            level policies and targets as well as relevant international, national and regional policies
            specifically relevant to standards and labelling. The analysis should include an assessment of
            how the different policies align, and their potential conflicts and synergies.

        3.	 Identification of opportunities in standards and labelling – The Consultant will review
            existing data and information on energy consumption in different industrial sub-sectors to
            identify those sub-sectors and key product groups with significant potential for improvements
            in energy consumption from standards and labelling. This analysis should be quantitative
            and supported by qualitative information, for example, from interviews, consultation with

a.	 Market analysis for industrial equipment – This analysis should take into account
    the energy consumption of main industrial sub-sectors identified and the relative
    contributions of different types of industrial equipment. The analysis should include
    the market size, potential efficiency improvements, and benefits to industrial energy
    consumers, the energy using product manufacturing sector and the country’s overall
    provision of energy (cost, security of supply and environmental impact). The potential
    impact on manufacturers, importers, and service providers, including financing and
    lending institutions should also be considered. [Note for practitioners: the nature
    and viability of this task will be sensitive to the availability of relevant data – if this
    is insufficient primary data collection activities may be required, which can be time
    consuming and incur associated costs.]
b.	 Evaluation and recommendations of which industrial equipment categories should
    be the focus of a pilot for a standards and labelling intervention. This should be based
    on predefined and agreed criteria, such as the potential for energy demand and cost
    reduction, priority for efficiency improvements of particular sub-sectors, impact on local
    equipment manufacturers and service providers, impact on imports etc.
c.	 Stakeholder mapping and identification of implementation partners at government,
    industry and donor level. This should identify the main partners and beneficiaries of a
    standards and labelling scheme for prioritized products and take into account past and
    current initiatives and regulatory interventions on improving the energy efficiency of
    industrial equipment.
d.	 Impact of a standards and labelling scheme, including an initial baseline assessment
    and potential impact of standards and labelling for prioritized equipment. This should
    include potential energy savings (kWh/year), company operational cost savings and a
    realistic and practical analysis of impacts from a standards and labelling scheme for the
    prioritized equipment. An assessment of different standards and labelling options should
    be undertaken.

      4.	 Institutional and Regulatory Analysis – Based on the analysis of opportunities, the
          Consultant should carry out a high-level analysis of the potential for standards and labelling
          for the prioritized industrial equipment in [insert country]. The analysis should include:
          a.	 Institutional analysis to understand the government’s and industry’s ability
              to implement a standards and labelling scheme. This analysis should take into
              account the capacity for implementation of the scheme, the costs associated with
              implementation (e.g. testing laboratories, inspections systems etc.) for the different
              parties involved and the benefits for their institutions.
          b.	 Regulatory and administrative barriers analysis to understand regulatory barriers,
              incentive structure, guidelines, and strategy. The analysis should identify if there is
              any legislation that allows regulation of industrial equipment energy efficiency, and
              agencies available to develop energy performance test procedures, minimum energy
              efficiency standards and labelling. If there is no legislation or regulation in effect, the
              Consultant should aim to understand whether draft legislation is in development and
              the potential barriers faced.
          	 [Note for practitioners: it is likely that the institutional and regulatory analysis may
              need to precede or be conducted in parallel with other analyses.]

      5.	 Implementation Plan – Based on the findings from Tasks 1-4 the Consultant should
          develop an implementation plan for the introduction of standards and labelling for energy
          efficient industrial equipment in [insert country]. This will include the development of a
          detailed and pragmatic work plan that identifies the activities to be undertaken, including
          duration, targets, key actors and associated mandates, stakeholder resource requirements
          and capacities, and timeframes. Activities should cover all stages of the standards and
          labelling scheme, including design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.

      Deliverables:
      •	 A report presenting the research, findings and recommendations from Tasks 1-4
      •	 An implementation plan from Task 5
      •	 A presentation summarizing the key findings and implementation plan

Step Four: Development and Design
Once the decision to develop a standards and labelling scheme has been taken, the design of
the label and the level of ambition for the standards and labelling classes needs to be considered
carefully. The design and format of any labelling is important, as this is the interface of the
scheme with the end user/purchaser. Labels are aimed at influencing and improving purchasing
choices, therefore they need to be clearly understood by consumers (either individuals or
businesses depending on the product group) and contain relevant information.

The levels of ambition of the standards and labelling classes set are also vital, as these are the
elements that will drive the market to improved efficiency. If they are too stringent or conversely
are too easy to meet, then this will reduce the effectiveness of the scheme; achieving the right
balance is important.

The design and development of the scheme will take time, and should be considered at an early
stage of a scheme’s development. The checklist tool below summarizes the main aspects that
should be considered to ensure the scheme is as effective as possible.

         Topic                         Considerations

         Label design                  FF   Label design should be started at the earliest possible stage once
         and format                         the decision to introduce a standards and labelling scheme has
                                            been made.
                                       FF   Working documents with the different options and their pros
                                            and cons should be drafted to ensure the process is clear and
                                            transparent.
                                       FF   Part of the design process should involve testing with focus groups,
                                            which include for example end users and manufacturers, with the
                                            feedback received incorporated into the final design and format.
                                       FF   Consider existing examples for similar schemes to help with the
                                            design and format of the label, for example China, Australia or EU
                                            energy labels.
                                       FF   For regional labels, the language used is important, bi-lingual
                                            labels can be used, as in Tunisia91, however the use of graphics
                                            and pictograms should be considered in order to eliminate the
                                            use of different languages where possible. This is advantageous
                                            for manufacturers, as they can then use a single label, with which
                                            purchasers across different countries will become familiar.
                                       FF   A harmonized regional label provides the opportunity for
                                            manufactures to ensure their products are labelled correctly, as they
                                            can apply the labels themselves, before their products leave the
                                            factory or importer warehouses, while national labels may need to
                                            be applied at the point of sale.

Topic                Considerations

Label design         FF   There will need to be some input from the standardization
and format                organizations and relevant ministries/implementing agencies,
                          together with relevant testing bodies, which will depend on the
                          test standards used, to ensure information on the label is consistent
                          with that provided by the test standards.
                     FF   While harmonization of label design can be beneficial, for example
                          in terms of trade, there may be cultural differences between
                          countries that mean country specific designs are most appropriate.
                     FF   If developing a harmonized regional label, then consideration of
                          any existing national schemes will be needed to ensure they align
                          and compliance efforts for industry are minimized. This may include
                          alignment or withdrawal of national labels in order to strengthen a
                          proposed regional label.

Level of             FF   The level of ambition of any standards e.g. MEPS, and labelling
ambition /                classes needs careful consideration, taking into account the market
standards                 analysis undertaken previously to help identify target product
setting                   groups.
                     FF   Addition market data or insights may also be required to
                          understand current market performance and forthcoming product
                          developments to help set standards and labelling classes at the
                          appropriate level. This could include for example knowledge of
                          the expected learning curve manufactures will be required to go
                          through in relation to standards and labelling for a given product
                          group.
                     FF   Develop labelling classes in line with any MEPS that may be set, to
                          ensure the two are aligned.

      Topic              Considerations

      Level of           FF   Harmonization of the parameters and test standards used with
      ambition /              other labels will help reduce impacts on manufacturers, such
      standards               as cost; however, the thresholds set should reflect the market
      setting                 the standards and label are aimed at. For example, if the most
                              advanced products have yet to penetrate the market the scheme
                              may need to reflect this to ensure the scheme’s effectiveness is
                              maximized.
                         FF   Verification should be in line with appropriate test standards used
                              in criteria.

      Consultation       FF   Coordination between different parts of government is critical to
                              a successful standards and labelling scheme. This will help define
                              roles and responsibilities, and the necessary levels of support, as
                              identified in Step 3.
                         FF   Consultation with interested stakeholders is vital when developing
                              the scope and criteria for a given product group, including
                              manufacturers and importers.
                         FF   Stakeholder consultation can provide valuable information e.g.
                              technical developments, current product performance, sales.
                         FF   Consultation can be through various means, for example websites,
                              focus groups and expert working groups.
                         FF   Stakeholder feedback will help inform the decision making process
                              of the organization leading the scheme’s development.
                         FF   Scenario analysis and outputs from tools such as PAMS (see Step
                              2) can be used to help communicate the policy implications of
                              standards and labelling and the setting of appropriate MEPS and
                              labelling classes.

Topic              Considerations

Timing/phasing     FF   The timing of introducing a standards and labelling scheme will
and voluntary           need to take into consideration the availability of products on the
vs. mandatory           market.
requirements       FF   Industry will need advance warning particularly of mandatory
                        elements (probably at least a year), to enable them to prepare
                        accordingly.
                   FF   Consider introducing labels on a voluntary basis with the aim of
                        them becoming mandatory after a couple of years. This will help
                        acceptance and familiarity to be developed amongst manufacturers
                        and purchasers. See the example below for India, where labelling can
                        be either mandatory or voluntary depending on the product group.
                   FF   Consider introducing MEPS after labelling has been introduced and
                        once the market has been reviewed to ensure there is a sufficient
                        supply of energy efficient products – this may be 2-3 years after
                        mandatory labelling.
                   FF   MEPS may be phased, with increasing stringency over time.
                   FF   Allow sufficient time for the market to respond to the standards
                        and labelling requirements – for example ensuring the supply
                        of products that comply with label/MEPS are available before it
                        becomes mandatory, at a cost comparable with non-compliant
                        products.
                   FF   An element of market surveillance is important to help understand
                        how the market responds to the standards and labelling scheme
                        to ensure it does not impact negatively and sufficient products
                        are available. Consultation with manufacturers and importers /
                        distributors will also help. Further information regarding
                        implementation and enforcement is covered in Step 6.
                   FF   Consider prohibiting other labels that illustrate energy use and
                        mandate the use of the national/regional label. This will help to
                        avoid confusion and misleading claims.

      India: Energy Efficiency Standards and Labelling Program
      The Indian Energy Conservation (EC) Act 2001 has provisions for mandatory energy efficiency
      labels and minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for appliances. The Bureau
      of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is the primary entity responsible for implementing the EC Act.
      Energy Efficiency Standards and Labelling (EESL) is one of the priority elements of the EC Act
      implementation. BEE has identified refrigerators and air-conditioners as high priority equipment
      for the EESL program. According to the EC Act, the government will:

      •	   Specify the equipment and appliances targeted for labelling and MEPS;
      •	   Specify the energy consumption test procedures to be used;
      •	   Direct display of labels on specified appliances; and
      •	   Enforce minimum efficiency standards by prohibiting manufacture, sale and import of
           products not meeting the minimum standards.

      The Bureau initiated a standards and labelling programme for equipment and appliances in
      2006 to provide the consumer an informed choice about the energy saving and thereby the
      cost saving potential of the relevant marketed products. The scheme covers 19 equipment/
      appliance types, specifically: room air conditioners; fluorescent tube lights; frost free
      refrigerators; distribution transformers; induction motors; direct cool refrigerators; electric
      storage type geysers; ceiling fans; colour TVs; agricultural pump sets; LPG stoves; washing
      machines; laptops; lighting ballasts; floor standing air conditioning; office automation products;
      diesel generating sets and diesel operating pump sets. The first four products were included
      under mandatory labelling from 7th January 2010; the others are presently in a voluntary
      labelling phase.

      The energy efficiency labelling programs under BEE are intended to reduce the energy
      consumption of appliances without diminishing the services they provide to consumers.
      Furthermore, the standards and labels for refrigerators and air-conditioners have periodically
      been made more stringent. As a result, the least-efficient products are removed from the
      market as the more efficient products are introduced.

      During the next phase (XII) the EESL program will target at least three more equipment/
      appliance types and the up-grading of the energy performance standards for equipment
      covered during the previous phase (XI).

Step Five: Launch of the scheme
Once the label has been designed and the standards and labelling classes set at appropriate levels
of ambition, the launch of the scheme can be considered. Key elements of the launch of any
scheme are the communication and training requirements. Initial thoughts regarding these can be
made in parallel to the previous step, with the details finalized once the design and development
of the label is complete. Only once these elements are in place should the scheme be launched.
The tool below provides a checklist of the main considerations for this step.

  Topic                 Considerations

  Capacity              FF   The organization implementing the scheme will need to build
  building                   capacity across targeting, design, implementation, product testing
                             and enforcement of the standards and labelling scheme.
                        FF   This will include, for example, program managers, enforcement
                             teams, testing and technical experts.
                        FF   Relevant training material will need to be developed as appropriate.
                        FF   Knowledge sharing between standards and labeling program
                             leads in the countries covered by a regional scheme should be
                             encouraged, and knowledge sharing between similar individual
                             country schemes.

      Topic                 Considerations

      Communication         FF   A clear communication strategy is required for the implementation
      plan / strategy            of any standards and labelling scheme. This needs to take into
      considerations             account a number of factors, including those below.

                                 help to ensure that the introduction of a standards and labelling
                                 scheme is aligned with any existing information provisions and
                                 takes into account the level of information already available.
                            FF   The communications strategy needs to address different
                                 stakeholders, including end purchasers, manufacturers, supplies,
                                 etc. The messaging will vary between different stakeholders. For
                                 example, manufacturers and suppliers will need to know about
                                 their obligations, whereas purchasers will need to understand the
                                 label and the benefits of selecting more efficient products.
                            FF   Communication methods can include television and radio adverts,
                                 the internet, print media (magazines and newspapers), billboard
                                 posters, point of sale information, but should be appropriate and
                                 accessible for the target population.

                                 products, in particular reductions in life cycle costs due to energy
                                 costs savings where there may be an initial higher product price.
                                 This will help foster the market for energy efficiency products.
                            FF   Key and consistent messaging between countries, especially for a
                                 regional scheme, should be agreed.

      Step Six: Implementation and enforcement
      When developing a standards and labelling scheme there are a number of practical
      implementation and enforcement elements that need to be designed to ensure the scheme can
      operate effectively once launched. The checklist tool below summarizes the key considerations for
      this step.

        Manufacturer          FF   A clear process for receipt and processing of applications from
        applications               manufacturers for voluntary elements of the standards and labelling
        / product                  scheme needs to be introduced to ensure it is implemented
        registration               correctly, for example, only products that meet the relevant criteria
                                   should display the label.
                              FF   As part of the application process, conformity with the criteria for
                                   MEPS will need to be checked.
                              FF   Verification can be undertaken by third party organizations or
                                   self-declarations by the manufacturer. This will have cost and
                                   administration implications, and will influence how robust and
                                   impartial the scheme is viewed.
                              FF   Dealing will applications will usually be the responsibility of the
                                   organization in charge of implementing the scheme.
                              FF   Product registration will be useful to enable a product database to
                                   be developed, against which monitoring and enforcement can be
                                   checked.

                                          undertaken and a copy of the test report / results
                                      o	 Person giving approval for inclusion in the database
                                 FF   If not regional, then a clear structure needs to be provided to
                                      countries covered by the label to ensure relevant and consistent
                                      information is collected.

                                      (transforming). Understanding the transformation of the market
                                      will help to assess the effectiveness of the standards and labelling
                                      scheme and inform future revisions to the criteria or labelling
                                      classes, and the inclusion of new products.
                                 FF   Monitoring of the market will usually be initiated by the
                                      organization implementing the scheme, but may involve others
                                      such as market research bodies and/or industry trade associations.

      Step Seven: Evaluation and Revision

      Once a scheme is established and starts to be used, periodic reviews will be needed to evaluate
      performance and identify any shortcomings that should be addressed, for example through the
      revision of the scheme’s framework, or revision of product specific standards or energy classes.
      Key to this will be understanding how the market has changed as a result of the standards and
      labelling to ensure they remain effective. Key considerations are captured in the checklist tool below.

         c.	 Consultation with relevant stakeholders (for example end users, manufacturers, testing
             bodies, etc.) on different labelling options should be undertaken. This should include
             the testing of different labelling designs with focus groups. [Note for practitioners:
             Market research tools can also include quantifiable analysis, which may be appropriate
             depending on circumstances, alongside tools such as focus groups.]
         d.	 A recommendation on a proposed label design and format should be made based on
             the research and consultation exercises.

      2.	 Legislative framework development support for a standards and labelling scheme
          will be provided by the Consultant to the responsible organization / department in
          [insert country] for policy making. This support should focus on the development of the
          overarching framework for a standards and labelling scheme including:
          a.	 Assistance in developing and drafting regulatory proposals for a standards and
              labelling scheme in [insert country]. This should take into account the cost of and
              the capacity for implementation. [Note for practitioners: This is only an example,
              depending on circumstances assistance may also be needed in developing the

          b.	 Supporting consultation processes on regulatory proposals, including workshops,
              seminars and written consultations, analysis of feedback and updates to the regulatory
              proposal.
          c.	 Identification and allocation of key roles and responsibilities within the proposed
              scheme across different organizations and stakeholders. This should include capacity
              and training support as appropriate for relevant agencies.

      3.	 Market preparedness and industry awareness raising Building on the market analysis
          undertaken as part of the identification of standards and labelling opportunities, the
          Consultant should hold a series of consultative meetings with manufacturers, suppliers,
          importers and service providers and share with them global and regional good practice
          on [insert industrial equipment] standards and labelling. The market potential and
          financial benefits should be communicated based on quantitative market information.
          The consultant should also identify other ways in which these industry stakeholders can
          benefit from a [insert industrial equipment] standards and labelling scheme. Efforts should
          be made to bring together different groups of stakeholders, including manufacturers and
          service providers, industrial energy consumers, business associations, government officials,

   test bodies and relevant NGOs in order to formulate a phased action plan for marketing
   and awareness raising that will benefit these stakeholders. The planned activities should
   help develop marketing messages and help to identify and coordinate with potential
   media and communication outlets.
•	 Deliverables – Detailed marketing and communication strategy for the various stakeholder
   groups that is practical, cost sensitive and with greatest reach.

4.	 Development and drafting of regulations and standards – The Consultant should
    work with relevant government agencies to develop appropriate standards and labelling
    for [insert industrial equipment]. This should include:
    a.	 Development of an evidence base to inform the setting of standards and labelling
        classes for [insert industrial equipment] in particular, the key parameters to be included
        and the level of ambition at which standards are to be set. This analysis should include,
        but not be limited to: a review of relevant existing standards and labelling at national
        and international levels; stakeholder consultation; review of market data including
        sales and environmental performance of current and future products / technologies;
        identification of key environmental impacts; assessment of improvement potential
        and finalization of baselines and policy recommendations (including draft standards,
        labelling classes and associated efficiency levels, balance between standards and
        labelling and how they align, basis of scheme (voluntary vs. mandatory), transitional
        periods). A clear rationale for all proposals and decisions should be outlined.
        [Note for practitioners: The workload for this package of work is likely to be
        significant and may need to form a separate tender in its own right.]
    b.	 Assisting relevant government agencies in the drafting of regulations, standards,
        guidelines, and other forms of legal text to help implement and promote the scheme.
        These outputs should be implementation ready and take into account costs and
        capacity of the relevant agencies in [insert country] to ensure they are practical and
        there is the ability of the government to implement them. Sensitivity should be
        given to the legal provisions that can be readily implemented by the government of
        [insert country], which are in line and do not conflict with the overarching legislative
        framework for the standards and labelling scheme.

      5.	 Implementation support – Following the establishment of a standards and labelling
          scheme for [insert industrial equipment], the Consultant should provide guidance and
          implementation support to the various stakeholder groups, including but not limited to:
          a.	 Policy makers – Assist relevant parties as necessary following approval of standards
              and labelling regulations. This may require workshops and seminars to support
              the regulations, and assistance on marketing and communication of the legislative
              framework for the standards and labelling scheme, and specific regulations for [insert
              industrial equipment]. The proposed monitoring and evaluation framework should be
              piloted and put into operation.
          b.	 Manufacturers, suppliers and service providers – Assist this group of stakeholder
              to prepare for and take advantage of the standards and labelling scheme.
          c.	 Business associations – The consultant should engage with the relevant business
              associations for [insert relevant industrial sectors] to ensure they are promoting
              efficient [insert industrial equipment] opportunities and the scheme within these
              industries.
          d.	 Financial institutions – Financing is a critical part of energy efficiency for industries.
              To support the scheme, the consultant should work with potential funders in order to
              link businesses to banks that provide lending services to firms within the appropriate
              sectors. Support in identifying adequate government funding for its activities,
              including the compliance infrastructure should be considered.

19.	 Detailed Case Study: Implementation of a 	
	    standards and labelling scheme in Egypt

Introduction
This case study provides insight into the practicalities of developing a standards and labelling
scheme for industrial equipment. The case study focuses on the diagnostic phase of establishing
a standards and labelling scheme for electric motors in Egypt, which was completed in May 2015.
However, key considerations and recommendations with respect to the implementation phase
that arose from the diagnostic analysis are also highlighted.

It is important to note that this case study is included as an example only to illustrate
some of the issues and practical considerations when developing a standards and
labelling scheme. It does not necessarily reflect a model approach for use in different
countries. Each country will have its own set of circumstances that will need to be
considered specifically and addressed accordingly.

Background and Context
The key drivers that are influencing energy use in Egypt and the impacts this is having are
important to understand as this provides important context for the consideration of policies to
address particular issues, including the introduction of a standards and labelling program for
industrial equipment.

The industry and residential sectors are the main electricity consumers in Egypt, with 33% and
40% of demand respectively. Demand is forecast to continue rising, with electricity consumption
in each of the industrial and residential sectors due to exceed 80,000 GWh per year by 2020.

The growth in energy consumption, which affects oil and natural gas in addition to electricity,
is driven by population growth, economic development, increased energy intensive industrial
activities, increased vehicle sales (private and commercial) and energy subsidies. This has resulted
in Egypt struggling with its energy security in recent years, with serious energy shortages to meet
local demands. These issues have implications for the country’s economic growth, with impacts
arising from imbalances in the energy sector, including: shortage of fuels; reducing revenues



                3 IMPLEMENTATION                                     4 STANDARDS                       237
      from the export market; widening budget deficits; and an increasing energy subsidy burden. In
      addition, there are the environmental impacts associated with increased energy consumption.

      Why focus on the industrial sector?
      The first key step to successfully implementing a standards and labelling scheme is to undertake
      a diagnostics analysis to identify the areas on which to focus and to identify gaps in the current
      institutional and regulatory frameworks that need addressing.

      Egypt already has a standards and labelling program focused on consumer equipment, which
      covers products such as lighting, fridges and freezers, air conditioning units, washing machines
      and electric storage water heaters. This program is administered by the Egyptian Organization for
      Standards and Quality (EOS).

      In response to the issues highlighted above and the importance of the industry sector in terms
      of electricity consumption, consideration has been given to extending the program to include
      industrial equipment. Improving the energy efficiency of products has an important role in helping
      reduce consumption, with analysis at a global level, identified by Egypt in its diagnostics analysis,
      highlighting the significant potential energy efficiency savings available in the industrial sector.

      Understanding the industrial sector – what to focus on?
      In order to consider expanding the standards and labelling program to include industrial
      equipment, Egypt undertook a more detailed analysis of its industrial sector, as part of the
      diagnostic phase. This was done to provide greater understanding of where and how energy is
      used within the industrial sector in order to inform the focus for subsequent activities, including
      the identification of potential product groups on which to focus.

      The initial step undertaken was to understand the industrial sector in Egypt further, by identifying
      key industrial sectors and activities in Egypt and the number of industrial facilities within the country.
      This was achieved by using existing information to understand the importance of different sectors
      i.e. agriculture, industry and services together with stakeholder engagement to help categorize
      industry activities and the number of facilities within Egypt. Textiles, food processing, tourism,
      chemicals, pharmaceuticals, hydrocarbons, construction, cement, metals and light manufacturing
      constitute the major industries in Egypt, with an estimated 30,000-40,000 registered industrial
      facilities within the country, which include micro, small, medium and large enterprises.



238                        1 URGENCY                                      2 CONCEPT AND DESIGN
Identifying the energy consumption of different industrial activities is key to ensuring the
standards and labelling scheme focuses on the most relevant areas. Industrial activities were
categorized as energy intensive and non-energy intensive, with data from the Ministry of
Petroleum identifying the steel, cement and fertilizer industries as the largest primary energy
consumers. Further data on electricity consumption identified the metal (iron & steel, aluminum
etc.), cement, food, textiles and fertilizer industries as the major consumers of electricity in Egypt.

Which industrial products groups should be included?
A successful standards and labelling scheme needs to target opportunities with impacts and
product groups that are suited to the standards and labelling approach. As part of the diagnosis
phase Egypt analyzed the following products, to assess the potential impact and appropriateness
for inclusion within a standards and labelling scheme:
•	 Industrial motors;
•	 Industrial fans; and
•	 Industrial boilers.

For each product group the approach to the analysis was broadly the same. This is briefly outlined
below, using the example of motors to illustrate how the activities were undertaken and the types
of issues that arose.

Product categorization, for example providing an overview of the different types of motors
available on the market and those most relevant to industrial applications.

Electricity consumption data for different applications and types of products within a broader
product group is important in identifying those most important in terms of energy use. This
information was gathered from existing data sources. For example, a global analysis for the sector
wise distribution of electricity demand for motors was identified in a paper by the International
Energy Agency (IEA). Further analysis undertaken by UNIDO was also identified as part of the
Egyptian diagnosis analysis, which identified pumps, fans, ventilation systems and compressed air
systems as the main electricity consuming motor systems in the industries in Egypt.

The relative importance of these different motor systems varies between industries, with
information identified from the IEA on the typical split of these different uses across different
industry types.

      The level of existing information available will vary between countries, and several different
      sources are likely to be required in order to establish the level of detail and understanding
      required. Where existing information is not available, for example through previous studies and
      reports, other sources may need to be used, for example consultation with key stakeholders
      and/or modelling where the level of information available enables reasonable assumptions to be
      made.

      Understanding the market for the product group is important, as this will be used to help
      assess the potential improvement and impact of a proposed standards and labelling scheme.

      The diagnostic analysis included consultation with a range of organizations to help identify data
      and understand the market for motors in Egypt. The discussions with stakeholders established
      that there is limited information on market data of motors in Egyptian industry. This is not an
      uncommon problem, and in many cases identifying market data will be challenging, with data
      not existing or unavailable, for example due to manufacturers’ commercial confidentiality.

      In the case of Egypt, the Central Agency for Public Mobilization & Statistics (CAPMAS) was able
      to provide some market data on total electric motors sales for the 2011-2013 period. This left
      remaining issues to be resolved, for example identifying the sales in specific industrial sectors and
      the sales by size/capacity of the motor.

      A review of the literature identified a further paper detailing the Egyptian motor market
      segmentation by size of electric motors. This data was 18 years old, which raised concerns about
      its applicability to the current market structure. Instead, an alternative top-down approach was
      used, based on more recent global analysis of motor markets undertaken by the IEA.

      The IEA analysis indicates industrial motors represent 10% of overall electric motor market
      globally. Applying this to the total motor sales in Egypt provided by CAPMAS it was estimated
      the industrial motor market in Egypt to be approximately 1 million units in 2013. These are
      principally medium sized motors, which are the most significant consumers of electricity,
      accounting for 68% of total electricity consumption. Smaller motors are mainly used in
      residential and commercial applications, and larger motors are usually bespoke designs. Based
      on this information, Egypt focused its further analysis on medium sized motors with respect to
      developing a standards and labelling scheme for industrial motors.

Energy savings potential in motors and motor systems (i.e. systems incorporating motors)
was the next aspect to be assessed. The potential level of improvement was identified from the
literature, for example, efficient motor designs can improve energy efficiency by up to 10% in
comparison with standard motors. The additional cost of efficient motors also needs considering,
with a 20% premium identified, which results in a relatively short payback period of a few years
and an attractive lifetime economic performance.

Motor systems are more complex and energy efficiency improvements can be made not only
using higher efficiency motors, but also the efficient design of the system itself and components
used, such as pumps, compressors and fans. Information on motor systems in industries at a
global level, this time undertaken by UNIDO, was identified to provide information on average
saving potentials, which was based on several US and EU studies. This information was used to
estimate potential savings in Egypt – see below.

Challenges to the implementation of energy efficiency measures for industrial motors do exist
and were identified as part of the diagnosis analysis. These included:
•	 limited end user control over the efficiency of motors in motor systems;
•	 investment decisions largely made on initial cost, not taking into account lifetime running
   costs;
•	 energy efficient motors being mostly imported into Egypt at high prices, limiting the availability
   of such products at reasonable prices;
•	 a lack of knowledge amongst operators on how to run motors efficiently;
•	 the absence within companies of an incentive to purchase efficient equipment where there is
   a disconnect between the purchasing department and the department responsible for energy
   costs.

It is important to understand such challenges, as they will influence how a standards and labelling
scheme is implemented; for example, the scope of products/systems targeted and the level and
type of communications and awareness raising that is required.

      Opportunities to improve energy efficiency through standards and labelling were considered.
      This was initially done at a high level to consider the applicability of such measures to standalone
      motors and motor systems. The conclusion of this analysis indicated that the initial priority should
      be on the motor component, with labelling of wider components of systems something that
      could be considered in the future. This would address standards for new products. Optimization
      of existing stock would not be addressed through standards and labelling, with options such as
      energy audits and capacity development more appropriate for addressing this aspect.

      Global MEPS programs were reviewed to help inform the development of the standards
      and labelling scheme in Egypt. This review helped to identify relevant test standards and the
      parameters and benchmarks set, for example in relation to the efficiency of electric motors.

      Energy saving potential in Egypt for industrial motors was calculated using a top down
      approach. This was used due to the limited availability of reliable data on market size and
      electricity consumption of electric industrial motors in Egypt. It was therefore considered the most
      appropriate approach to provide a best-estimate of electric motor electricity consumption and
      savings potential, based on the data collected through the various sources, identified in the above
      steps, and the setting of appropriate assumptions. The key stages of the top-down approach
      were as follows:
      •	 Determine total electricity consumption in Egypt.
      •	 Estimate electricity consumption in the industry sector.
      •	 Estimate electricity consumption by motors in the industry sector.
      •	 Market segmentation of the motor market based on capacity and calculation of energy
         consumption for each capacity category, small, medium and large.
      •	 Develop assumptions to derive stock and annual sales for each motor category.
      •	 Identify the focus capacity categories and potential savings from standards and labelling by
         promoting energy efficient motors.

      Key assumptions were as follows:
      •	 Average annual growth rates for electricity consumption to forecast consumption from when
         the standard and labelling scheme would be implemented, i.e. 2018.
      •	 Assumptions, based on information from the literature, regarding percentage electricity
         consumption in industries and for the different capacity sizes (small, medium and large) were
         made to calculate electricity consumption for each size.

•	 Existing stock was calculated based on the total electricity consumption for the different
   capacity categories and assumptions on the median size, annual hours of operation, load
   factor, average efficiency and average life, based on analysis by IEA.
•	 Sales were calculated based on the replacement of existing stock and addition of new stock,
   using lifetime assumptions already established. It was also assumed that all stock prior to 2018
   were standard motors, and they would be replaced with efficient motors.
•	 To calculate the energy efficiency improvement potential, a 10% improvement was assumed.
•	 Further assumptions were made in relation to power plant capital costs, fixed operations
   and maintenance costs, variable operations and maintenance costs, GHG conversion rates,
   average electricity prices for medium sized industries, annual operation hours of power plant,
   transmission and distribution losses and average power plant capacity factor. These assumptions
   enabled the avoided generation capacity and associated cost savings to be calculated.

Simple payback calculations were also made, indicating a payback period of only 1.28 years
when specifying an energy efficient rather than standard motor. Assumptions were formed
to calculate the payback on the following parameters: motor efficiency and price; operating
conditions (hours of operation per day, days operated, lifetime, loading); and electricity prices for
medium sized industries.

Conclusions of analysis for electric motors
The analysis enabled the following conclusions to be drawn for motors:

From a standards and labelling perspective the focus should be on medium sized motors, as these
are mainly used by industry and account for significant electricity consumption. Although small
motors have significant stock and sales, they account for a relatively small proportion of the total
electricity consumption by industry (less than 10%). The benefits of standards and labelling of
medium sized motors are summarized below:

Industry Benefits
•	 Potential for saving more than 400 GWh of electricity annually by replacing the new purchase
   of standard motors by energy efficiency motors. Savings range from 439 GWh in 2018 to
   around 700 GWh in 2021.
•	 The electricity savings would result in annual monetary savings varying from 35 million USD in
   2018 to around 70 million USD in 2021.

      Benefits to government and power generation units
      •	 The electricity saved by energy efficient motors in industries would result in substantial
         electricity demand reductions at power plants, which in terms of avoided generation capacity
         would equate to ~100 MW in 2018 and ~160 MW in 2021.
      •	 These savings are extremely important for the Egyptian government, which is already
         struggling with an energy crisis due to fuel shortages.

      Further considerations
      In addition to understanding the market and the improvement potential of different products
      types, other key parameters were considered as part of the diagnostic assessment for Egypt to
      help inform the decision making process.

The existing standards and labeling scheme for domestic appliances was reviewed, and
an overview of the current status of developments provided. This helped to identify the roles of
various stakeholders, and the capacity gaps and other issues that existed. This insight is helpful to
the implementation of the industrial standards and labelling scheme.

Institutional capacity in Egypt was reviewed in consultation with stakeholders to assess
existing capacity and identify gaps. The need for clear roles and responsibilities was identified,
with multiple organizations currently working together to define energy sector policies, but not
enough clarity on implementation responsibilities. It is therefore considered important for the
Egyptian government to appoint a single authority responsible for the implementation of the
standards and labelling scheme.

The readiness economy for implementing S&L program for industrial equipment in Egypt
has been considered by undertaking institutional and regulatory analysis, including discussion
with IFC, World Bank and other stakeholders in Egypt.

Key institutional aspects that require addressing for an industrial standards and labelling
scheme in Egypt include:
•	 a clearly defined institutional structure including roles, responsibilities and authorities;
•	 increased technical training of staff;
•	 development of standard guidelines;
•	 the legal basis of the establishment of technical committees and the formation of technical
   committees for relevant industrial products;
•	 establishment of in-country test infrastructure for industrial equipment;
•	 development of standard energy saving calculation methodologies;
•	 evaluation of the needs and mechanism for financial assistance;

      Summary
      Based on the understanding gathered from the analysis, a final matrix (Figure 27) was developed
      taking into consideration impact, approach and implementation factors to provide an overall
      rating for the implementation of standards and labelling for different components of electric
      motor systems and boilers. This clearly identified stand-alone electric motors as the priority for an
      industrial standards and labelling scheme:

Next Steps – Implementation Considerations
The activities described above provided the evidence for the business case to support a standards
and labelling scheme in Egypt, in particular for electric motors. The next stage that Egypt will
focus on is the implementation of the standards and labelling scheme. As part of the diagnosis
phase, an implementation plan identified the key steps, together with key considerations that
Egypt will need to consider.

Market Analysis will build on the analysis undertaken in the diagnosis phase outlined above.
In addition to market information on motor equipment, this should also include an assessment
of the testing infrastructure specific for electric motors, applicable test standards and a review
of global standards and labelling schemes for electric motors. The aim is to develop a standard
methodology for the market analysis, which can be used for other products in the future.

Test procedures are crucial to standards and labelling schemes. In Egypt there is no national
test procedure for industrial electric motors, therefore one will need to be developed. This will
need to take into account existing international standards to ensure international trade and
competitiveness in local markets can be facilitated.

Development of MEPS will be developed by EOS through legislative procedures. This will include
discussions with stakeholder groups and experts to develop the MEPS and the introduction, for
example on a phased basis with increasingly stringent requirements introduced over time. This will
include a revision schedule as part of the scheme’s roadmap so that industry can plan and revise
equipment designs in advance.

Generating energy performance data for electric motors will be a significant activity for the
implementation of the standards and labelling scheme. Two key aspects need to be addressed.
First EOS will need to develop a system to collect and record test reports from manufacturers
based on the final test procedures agreed. Secondly, there is currently no test facility for industrial
motors in Egypt. This gap will need to be addressed in the longer term to enable EOS to test
sample equipment.




                 3 IMPLEMENTATION                                      4 STANDARDS                        247
      Launch of a standards and labelling scheme for electric motors can be done once standards
      are set and test requirements established. EOS will need to consider, along with implementing
      partners and stakeholders, whether to introduce a voluntary or mandatory scheme. They will also
      need to develop an outreach campaign to communicate effectively about the scheme and its
      benefits. It has been recommended that this include a web portal, which is updated regularly.

      Monitoring verification and enforcement protocols will need to be developed by EOS.
      These will need to include the roles and responsibilities of EOS staff and stakeholders (e.g.
      manufacturers and suppliers) to ensure that monitoring, verification and enforcement is effective.

      Training and capacity building will be key to ensure the successful implementation and
      management of the standards and labelling scheme. A review of training needs in Egypt in
      proposed, in consultation with EOS, following which a training strategy can be developed. This
      will build the capacity of EOS staff and other stakeholders towards international best practices.

      A 30-month timeline has been proposed and outlined as part of the diagnostic phase for the
      above implementation activities.
