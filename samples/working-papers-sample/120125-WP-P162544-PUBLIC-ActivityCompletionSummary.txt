                         BRIEF ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION

                         Sector Overview:
                         Azerbaijan, a resource-rich country, has been developing its natural gas sector rapidly over the past decades. Proven
                         natural gas reserves are of the order of 1,000 bcm with the Shah Deniz field making up the largest share of these reserves.
                         Azerbaijan produced about 18.8 bcm in 2014, primarily from Shah Deniz and Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli fields.
                         Azerbaijan joined EITI in 2004 at the outset of this initiative and was the first country to be validated as fully EITI-compliant
                         in 2009. Subsequently, with enforcement of changes to legislation on registration and processing of grants/funds received
                         by local NGOs from international donors, many local civil society organizations faced difficulties in regard to their
                         operations.
                         Following deep concern for the ability of civil society to engage critically in the EITI process in Azerbaijan, at the EITI Board
                         meeting (October 2014), the EITI Board decided to require Azerbaijan to undergo a compliance check earlier than planned,
                         and the country was downgraded to ‘candidate’ status at the EITI Board meeting on April 14th, 2015 following an early
                         Validation report. At the EITI Board meeting on 26th October, 2016, Azerbaijan was found to have made meaningful
                         progress, but more was needed to be done, especially on civil society engagement. The Board had agreed that

                         Azerbaijan was to be assessed in a third Validation commencing on 26 July 2017.
                          Therefore, the Government’s objectives were to: (a) regain its EITI compliant status; (b) mainstream transparency
                         reporting across the government institutions; and (c) embed data collection and transparent reporting for the oil and gas
                         sector into existing government systems.
                         Moreover, the proposed mainstreaming of EITI in Azerbaijan occurred in the context of the construction of the Trans-
                         Anatolian Gas Pipeline (“TANAP”) project, which when constructed and operational, will carry natural gas from Azerbaijan
                         to Turkey, and further to Europe. TANAP is to be supported for a period of 4 years through future IBRD-based lending,
                         with USD 400 million each to be committed to the Governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey respectively. The large cash-
                         flows that were to arise once TANAP commences operation made mainstreaming of EITI of great importance to the
                         Government of Azerbaijan, which had assured the World Bank of its support to the process .The Government of Azerbaijan
                         was thus expected to make funding available to follow-up on the next steps subsequent to the completion of this ASA.
                         Rationale for the activity:
                         The Ministry of Finance, Government of Azerbaijan, through letter dated 13th July, 2016, to the World Bank, had asked
                         for support towards EITI implementation, thereby evidencing a demand for this activity. In response to the above-
                         mentioned letter from the Government of Azerbaijan to the World Bank, the Regional Vice President, Europe and Central
                         Asia, responded by specifically confirming the World Bank's support to a proposed activity at mainstreaming EITI in
                         Azerbaijan.
                         This ASA was also aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy for Azerbaijan FY'16-'20("CPS"). In fact, the CPS in
                         paragraph 27 specifically cited the following as a development challenge “..strengthen governance via participation in the
                         Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and Open Government Partnerships (OGP)”. This ASA, by mainstreaming
                         EITI implementation in Azerbaijan and embedding transparency into the country’s governance systems, also resonated
                         with Pillar I of the objectives of the EGPS (Extractives Global Programmatic Support) trust fund, i.e. ‘EITI and Transparency
                         - supporting implementation of the EITI and broader reforms on sector transparency and good governance’.
                         Previous World Bank Group Support to EITI Implementation in Azerbaijan:
                         No previous grant had been made to Azerbaijan from the World Bank Group for the direct implementation of EITI, as the
                         initiative was self-funded by the government of Azerbaijan. However, there had in the past been a single grant for
                         assistance towards CSOs engaged in EITI in Azerbaijan titled “Azerbaijan EITI Civil Society Support (P150813)”. The

                         development objective of the grant was to “enhance the capacity of local civil society organizations and increase public

                         The objective of this activity is to support the government of Azerbaijan’s efforts to mainstream EITI into governmental
                         and company reporting systems.

                         governmental and company reporting systems. On March 9, 2017, the EITI Board decided on suspension of Azerbaijan’s
                         membership in EITI. The GoAZ disagreed with the Board’s decision and on March 10, 2017 announced the withdrawal of
                         the country’s membership from EITI. Consequently, the project team had to discontinue further implementation of this
                         ASA.
                         The planned deliverables under this ASA were as follows: (i) Terms of Reference for conducting the feasibility study for
                         mainstreaming EITI in Azerbaijan; (ii) assistance with the development of an application by Azerbaijan to the EITI Board for

                         program for mainstreaming EITI.
                         Due to Azerbaijan’s exit from EITI, the project team completed only deliverable (i), which was developed following a
                         consultation workshop. Along with this, an additional deliverable in the form of a power point presentation on the possible
                         structure of a mainstreamed EITI process in Azerbaijan was also presented in a roundtable on 'Mainstreaming EITI in
                         Azerbaijan'.

                         In addition to these outputs delivered to the client, the project team also prepared for internal use and dissemination a
                         document on the lessons learnt from the ASA and next steps for Azerbaijan, as well as a presentation on the activities and

                         Outcomes
                         Work under this ASA had begun in late 2016 to support the Government of Azerbaijan is its plans to
                         “mainstream” the Azerbaijan EITI (AZEITI) process by embedding transparency and disclosures required under
                         the EITI standard into existing and new government and company reporting and statistical systems.

                         The work completed to date includes (i) detailed discussions with Azerbaijan EITI leadership on strategies and
                         desired outcomes for EITI mainstreaming; (ii) holding a consultative workshop of wider EITI stakeholders and
                         representatives of key Azerbaijan government ministries and agencies to raise awareness of this ASA and
                         understand priorities for EITI mainstreaming; and (iii) as a key deliverable, preparing a draft feasibility study
                         Terms of Reference (ToR) to the former Azerbaijan EITI Multi Stakeholder Group for it to adopt
                         and subsequently procure a specialist vendor to design the EITI mainstreaming blueprint.

                         Additionally, to further build stakeholder consensus and discuss EITI mainstreaming proposals and

                         implementation questions, this draft ToR was discussed in a second workshop in Baku attended by Azerbaijan
                         EITI stakeholders and representatives of International EITI Secretariat, Oslo.

                          In March 2017, Azerbaijan formally withdrew from the global EITI process. One consequence was that the
                         remainder of this ASA, being an EITI-related activity, became redundant.

                         The remaining steps, had this ASA continued in the context of Azerbaijan still being a member of EITI, were (i)
                         to support Azerbaijan EITI authorities on knowledge-exchange with other EITI countries and (ii) to serve as an
                         advisory resource to Azerbaijan EITI in advancing the proposed EITI mainstreaming goals.



                         Lessons Learned
                         Notwithstanding its withdrawal from global EITI, Azerbaijan has reiterated its commitment to transparency
                         and reporting on extractives revenues and other disclosure requirements. The necessary legal decrees have
                         been issued, setting out institutional responsibilities and key tasks directed towards ensuring transparency is

                         maintained as it was under the former EITI process.

                         Azerbaijan was an early member of global EITI process and has implemented EITI under the global EITI
                         Standard for several years. Hence, the transition to a successor mechanism for sector and revenue
                         transparency in oil gas and mining will need careful management and attention, inter alia in the following
                         aspects:

                                 Sustained commitment by Government: Throughout the transition from EITI to a domestic system,
                                  Government’s commitment to transparency and inclusion will need to be sustained and deepened:
                                  legal backing; clear institutional responsibility; resources and outreach; and participation by wider civic
                                  society will be essential.
                                 Ensuring credibility: For the accuracy, quality and completeness of sector and revenues information
                                  reported, and for the overarching governance mechanisms of these disclosures, reliability of the
                                  reported data and credibility of its underlying governance will be important. Building the requisite
                                  credibility and data reliability will take time and a sustained effort to make the transition, building
                                  consensus and engaging with citizens and civic society.

                                 Drawing on global knowledge: Drawing on global best practice and knowledge will also help boost
                                  transparency goals. In this respect, ongoing dialogue with WBG and other IFIs will open avenues for
                                  partnership.

                                 Momentum on mainstreaming plans: At the appropriate time, attention will have to re-focus on
                                  mainstreaming of transparency, such that sector and revenue transparency are embedded in
                                  institutional systems as an integral part of Azerbaijan’s public finance systems. Key steps in this
                                  regards will be to reach agreement on (i) identifying the host agency for mainstreamed extractives
                                  transparency; and (ii) overarching systems design to integrate the various strands of reported

                                 Further innovations: The mainstreaming ideas under discussion also offer, over time, the potential for
                                  creating other mainstreamed extractive data linkages such as (i) with E-government initiatives; (ii)

                                 Actively enabling civic debate: Promoting participation by citizens by boosting knowledge of the
                                  extractives sectors; how the extractives sector and revenues are managed and its contribution to
                                  Azerbaijan's economic position.

                         Standard . Therefore, the deliverable of providing assistance in the development of an application by
                         Azerbaijan to the EITI Board for mainstreamed disclosures stands cancelled.
