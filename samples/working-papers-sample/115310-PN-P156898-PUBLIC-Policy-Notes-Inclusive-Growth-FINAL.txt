              Opportunities for the Urban Poor*
              1. Introduction and Context: Urbanization and Poverty 	
                 in the Philippines
              Urbanization is one of the most significant drivers of                                   Figure 1. Analytical Framework for
              development. It can provide a pathway out of poverty and                                 	         Inclusive Urbanization2
              act as an engine of growth. High urban densities can reduce
              transaction costs, make public spending on infrastructure
              and services more economically viable, and act as an
              economic hub that attracts investments and talents. But if                                                        Economic Inclusion
              not well managed, urbanization can give rise to inequality                                                          Jobs, skills dev, education,
                                                                                                                                    access to finance etc.
              and exclusion which affects a city’s competitiveness and
              opportunities for growth.


              Inclusive urbanization, where everyone can reap the                                              Social Inclusion                        Spatial Inclusion
              benefits, is critical to city competitiveness and growth.                                            Crime & violence                     Affordable and & housing,

              benefits of urbanization are important for inclusion.1 Inclusive
              urbanization requires an integrated multi-dimensional
              approach that addresses three key dimensions of inclusion                                infrastructure and basic services. Social inclusion relates to
              – economic, spatial, and social. Economic inclusion relates to                           fundamental principles of equal rights and participation
              addressing poverty and providing economic opportunities                                  of the marginalized in the development process. The three
              such as jobs, sources of livelihood, and access to finance.                              dimensions of inclusion are interrelated and mutually
              Spatial inclusion refers to improved access to land, housing,                            reinforcing. Policies must therefore address all three aspects.

              79 According to PDEA, a barangay is said to be drug-affected when there is a drug user, pusher, manufacturer, marijuana cultivator or other drug personality “regardless of
                  number in the area. There are three basic degrees as to how a barangay is affected by illegal drug activities --slightly affected, moderately affected, and seriously affected.
                  Barangays are considered slightly affected if there are identified drug users in the community but no known drug pushers or traffickers are operating in the area while
                  moderately affected if at least a suspected drug pusher or trafficker is operating in the barangay. A barangay is seriously affected if at least a drug laboratory, den, dive or
                  resort is suspected to exist in the community.
