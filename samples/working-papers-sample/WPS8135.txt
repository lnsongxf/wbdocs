  Abstract
  In developing countries, younger and better-educated                              representing almost 90 percent of the world population.
  cohorts are entering the workforce. This developing world-                        The findings under alternative assumptions suggest that
  led education wave is altering the skill composition of the                       global income inequality will likely decrease by 2030. This
  global labor supply, and impacting income distribution, at                        increasing educated labor force will contribute to the clos-
  the national and global levels. This paper analyzes how this                      ing of the gap in average incomes between developing and
  education wave reshapes global inequality over the long                           high income countries. The forthcoming education wave
  run using a general-equilibrium macro-micro simulation                            would also minimize, mainly for developing countries,
  framework that covers harmonized household surveys                                potential further increases of within-country inequality.

     1. Introduction	

The	 global	 labor	 market	 is	 undergoing	 a	 fundamental	 transformation	 with	 important	
consequences	on	global	inequality.	In	the	decades	ahead,	younger	and	better-educated	cohorts	
will	 enter	 the	 global	 workforce	 while	 older,	 less	 educated	 ones	 leave.	 With	 better	 education,	
workers	have	better	skills	(hereafter,	skilled	workers	in	this	paper	refer	to	those	having	nine	or	
more	years	of	education,	and	the	two	terms,	skilled	workers	and	better-educated	workers,	are	
used	 synonymously.)	 The	 new	 entrants	 of	 better-educated	 workers	 will	 come	 mainly	 from	
developing	countries	(figure	1).	This	paper	analyzes	the	effects	of	this	forthcoming	demographic	
and	education	transition	on	global	inequality	using	a	general-equilibrium	macro-micro	simulation	
framework	that	covers	harmonized	household	surveys	for	almost	120	developing	countries.	Our	
findings	suggest	that	a	more	educated	labor	force	in	developing	countries	will	contribute	to	a	
reduction	in	global	income	inequality	by	2030.

Notes:	 Skilled	 is	 defined	 as	 workers	 with	 more	 than	 nine	 years	 of	 education.	 Projections	 are	 based	 on	 UN	 (2015)	 and	
education	information	from	harmonized	household	and	labor	surveys	from	117	countries.		

        The	impending	change	in	the	skill	composition	of	labor	is	the	latest	wave	of	demographic	
and	education	trends	that	have	been	shaping	the	global	labor	market.	In	the	first	recent	wave,	a	
truly	global	labor	market	took	shape	almost	all	at	once	in	the	1990s,	when	China,	India,	and	the	
former	Soviet	bloc	joined	the	global	economy,	increasing	the	size	of	the	labor	pool	from	1.46	billion	
workers	 to	 2.93	 billion	 workers.	 This	 “great	 doubling”	 of	 global	 labor,	 as	 Freeman	 (2008	 and	
2007)	called	it,	came	from	new	entrants	who	were	low	skilled	and	low	wage.	The	impact	of	this	
great	 doubling	 on	 global	 inequality	 is	 not	 immediately	 clear,	 as	 it	 depends	 on	 changes	 in	 the	
dispersion	of	incomes	within	as	well	as	between	countries.	Freeman	argued	that	China,	India	and	
the	former	Soviet	bloc	would	not	contribute	much	to	the	global	capital	stock,	and	therefore	the	

                                                                                                                                    2
capital-labor	ratio	at	the	global	level	would	be	greatly	reduced	by	about	60%	of	what	it	would	have	
been	without	the	great	doubling.	This	factor	ratio	would	cause	an	increase	in	the	returns	to	capital	
vis-à-vis	 to	 wages	 and,	since	 physical	 and	 financial	 assets	 are	 more	 concentrated	 than	 human	
capital,	it	would	tend	to	push	inequality	up.3	Yet,	other	mechanisms	also	influence	the	results,	so	
that	 global	 inequality	 fell	 over	 the	 first	 wave	 despite	 the	 increase	 in	 inequality	 within	 many	
countries	(World	Bank	2006	and	2007,	Lakner	and	Milanovic	2016).	
        The	key	facts	about	the	second	wave	of	upcoming	changes	in	the	global	labor	market	are	
also	striking:	this	time,	a	wave	of	skilled	workers	from	developing	countries	will	take	center	stage.	
On	 current	 trends,	 based	 on	 UN	 population	 projections	 (UN	 2015)	 and	 present	 rates	 of	
educational	 enrollment	 (conservatively	 kept	 constant	 into	 the	 future),	 the	 world	 will	 see	 the	
number	of	skilled	workers	rising	from	1.66	billion	in	2011	to	2.22	billion	by	2050,	an	increase	of	
about	 560	 million	 or	 33	 percent.	 	 As	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 great	 doubling,	 the	 role	 of	 developing	
countries	 is	 crucial.	 Due	 to	 their	 investments	 in	 education	 and	 their	 growing	 populations,	
developing	countries	will	contribute	 all	of	the	additional	workers	to	the	world	pool	of	educated	
workers	(see	figure	1).	The	number	of	skilled	workers	in	high-income	countries	is	projected	to	
decline,	from	603	million	in	2011	to	601	million	in	2030	and	594	million	in	2050.		
          Not	exactly	another	great	doubling,	but	still	a	dramatic	change.	While	in	2011,	each	skilled	
worker	 in	 high-income	 countries	 was	 sharing	 the	 global	 market	 with	 two	 skilled	 workers	 in	
developing	countries;	by	2030	this	ratio	will	be	one	to	three.	The	increase	in	the	supply	of	skilled	
workers	will	likely	drive	down	the	education	premia	these	workers	enjoy	(other	things	being	
equal),	and	unlike	the	first	wave,	it	may	affect	inequality	within	countries	in	a	beneficial	way.	This	
kind	of	result	has,	for	example,	already	been	observed	in	developing	countries	in	Latin	America	
and	the	Caribbean	(Cruz	and	Milet,	2017	and	Lopez-Calva	and	Lustig,	2010).	Note	that,	because	of	
trade	links,	wages	of	skilled	workers	in	high-income	countries	will	also	come	under	pressure	even	
if	 their	 domestic	 supply	 will	 not	 be	 increasing.	 Signs	 of	 this	 pressure	 have	 also	 been	 already	
identified	and	attributed	to	trade	by	recent	research	(Autor	et	al.	2016).		
         An	important	factor	may,	however,	have	a	counteracting	role.	As	in	the	past,	technological	
progress	may	be	skill-biased	and	thus	offset	the	supply	(education)	effect.	Research	has	shown	
that	 in	 high-income	 countries	 like	 the	 United	 States,	 the	 premia	 for	 skilled	 workers	 remained	
firmly	 high	 even	 during	 expansions	 of	 the	 skilled	 labor	 supply	 (Acemoglu	 1998	 and	 2009).	
Conditional	on	what	will	happen	on	the	demand	for	labor	(i.e.	on	what	happens	to	technological	
change),	 the	 possible	 decrease	 in	 skilled	 and	 sectoral	 earnings	 premia	 may	 have	 profound	
consequences	 for:	 i)	 international	 trade	 patterns;	 ii)	 global	 and	 local	 economic	 growth;	 iii)	
inequality	across	countries;	and,	as	mentioned	iv)	inequality	within	countries	(see	Edwards	and	
Hertel-Fernandez	2010;	OECD	1999;	Shimer	2001;	Freeman	2007).		


3	Indeed,	several	authors	(e.g.	Atkinson	2015,	Bourguignon	2015,	Galbraith	2012,	Piketty	2014,	and	Stiglitz	2012)	have	

called	attention	to	the	recent	issue	of	rising	capital	share	in	total	value	added	and	to	the	concentration	of	income	and	wealth	
at	the	top	of	the	distribution	in	many	countries.	

                                                                                                                             3
         Our	 analysis	 focuses	 on	 forces	 of	 the	 educational	 wave	 that	 shape	 future	 supply	 and	
demand	in	the	labor	markets	and	their	ensuing	effects	on	global	income	distribution.	On	the	supply	
side,	it	considers	demographic	shifts,	improvement	in	education	achievements,	and	policies	that	
increase	access	to	education	and	enable	inter-sectoral	mobility.	On	the	demand	side,	it	accounts	
for	technological	change,	sectoral	patterns	of	growth,	and	trade.	It	then	draws	the	effects	of	these	
forces	on	global	inequality	by	2030,	which	is	the	target	year	of	the	Sustainable	Development	Goals	
(SDGs)	 as	 well	 as	 the	 World	 Bank’s	 goals	 of	 ending	 extreme	 poverty	 and	 boosting	 shared	
prosperity.4	Because	it	usually	takes	longer	than	15	years	for	the	stock	of	skilled	workers	to	show	
significant	improvement	from	the	new	inflow	of	younger	and	more	educated	workers	reaching	
the	labor	market,	the	time	horizon	to	2030	will	present	only	a	partial	effect	of	the	education	wave,	
hence	a	very	conservative	scenario.	
        This	 paper	 uses	 two	 well-tested	 global	 economic	 models,	 the	 LINKAGE	 global	 general	
equilibrium	 model	 and	 the	 Global	 Income	 Distribution	 Dynamics	 (GIDD)	 microsimulation	
framework.		As	such,	the	approach	allows	for	a	systematic	quantitative	analysis	of	the	global	effects	
of	educational	attainment	and	demographic	trends,	which	hitherto	have	been	relatively	neglected.		
For	example,	Ahmed	et	al.	(2016)	looks	only	at	the	demographic	dividend	of	the	Africa	region.		In	
looking	at	the	effect	of	changes	in	skill	premia	and	sector	mobility	of	labor	on	income	inequality,	
the	approach	relaxes	the	assumption	of	distribution-neutral	growth	found	in	other	studies	(e.g.		
Ravallion	2013)	to	analyze	global	poverty.	Like	the	first	wave,	our	results	suggest	that	the	next	
wave	of	education	and	demographic	trends	will	also	reduce	global	inequality	between	countries.	
Moreover,	the	second	wave	may	ameliorate	the	overall	increase	in	inequality	within	countries.	
Indeed,	the	baseline	scenario	suggests	a	decrease	the	Gini	index	for	most	countries	relative	to	the	
case	of	no	education	wave.5	
    	 The	remainder	of	this	paper	is	organized	as	follows:	Section	2	presents	observed	patterns	
of	global	inequality	in	the	last	decades	and	explains	how	the	education	wave	may	impact	inequality	
through	the	labor	markets.	Section	3	presents	the	methodology,	particularly	the	GIDD	modeling	
framework	 and	 descriptive	 statistics	 of	 the	 underlying	 microdata.	 Section	 4	 shows	 simulation	
results	along	with	robustness	checks.	The	last	section	concludes	with	policy	implications.	


       2. Recent	changes	in	global	inequality	and	labor	force	composition	

2.1	Evolution	of	global	inequality	
	
To	analize	the	evolution	of	inequality	across	the	world,		Milanovic	(2013)	suggests	three	concepts	
of	 global	 inequality:	 1)	 inequality	 across	 countries	 based	 on	 averages	 for	 GDP	 per	 capita	 or	

4
    The	topic	of	this	paper	is	directly	related	SDG	10	(Reduce	inequality	within	and	among	countries).

  These results, particularly within country, face several uncertainties regarding the possibility of disruptive
technological changes related to automation and jobs’ polarization (Autor, 2015).

                                                                                                              4
household	income;	2)	inequality	across	countries	based	on	population-weighted	GDP	per	capita	
or	household	income;	and	3)	global	inequality	using	household-level	data	from	surveys.	The	first	
two	concepts	refer	to	inequality	between	countries.	Relative	to	concept	1,	inequality	as	measured	
by	concept	2	reflects	the	weight	of	relative	population	size	in	addition	to	discrepancies	in	average	
incomes.		The	within-country	component	of	inequality	is	nonetheless	critical.	It	is	possible,	for	
instance,	that	a	low-income	country	could	catch	up	on	average	per	capita	income	at	the	expense	of	
rising	inequality	among	its	residents.	This	effect	will	neither	be	captured	by	concept	1	or	concept	
2.		Among	the	three	concepts	of	global	inequality,	the	individual-based	concept	3	is	the	only	one	
that	takes	into	account	inequality	between	as	well	as	within	countries.	It	requires,	however,	a	large	
amount	of	harmonized	micro	data	to	perform	any	attempt	for	international	comparison.	In	this	
paper,	we	analyze	global	inequality	using	the	individual-based	(concept	3)	approach.	
       From	1950	to	2000s,	inequality	between	countries	using	concept	1	increased,	while	
inequality	using	concept	2	decreased.		However,	during	the	last	decade,	both	concepts	show	
a	 dramatic	 reduction	 in	 inequality	 (Milanovic	 2013).	 	 The	 individual-based	 inequality	
(concept	3)	also	showed	a	decreasing	trend	between	2000	and	2010	(see	Milanovic	2013;	
Lakner	 and	 Milanovic	 2016),	 but	 at	 a	 slightly	 smaller	 reduction	 when	 compared	 to	 the	
pattern	of	concepts	1	and	2.	Since	concepts	1	and	2	are	about	between-country	inequality,	
the	individual-based	result	somewhat	suggests	that	within-country	component	of	inequality	
may	have	increased	in	this	period.	
         Lakner	and	Milanovic	(2016)	show	that	(individual-based)	global	inequality,	as	measured	
by	 the	 Gini	 index,	 dropped	 from	 72.2	 in	 1988	 to	 70.5	 in	 2008.	 This	 recent	 decline	 in	 global	
inequality	can	be	largely	explained	by	the	economic	progress	during	the	last	decades	in	low-	and	
middle-income	countries,	particularly	by	the	sustained	growth	of	populous	countries	like	China	
and	 India.6	 Increased	 trade	 benefited	 low-skilled	 workers	 in	 China,	 India	 and	 partly	 from	 the	
Soviet	bloc.	Demand	for	the	goods	they	produced	went	up,	and	so	did	their	wages.	The	opposite	
happened	 for	 low-skilled	 workers	 in	 high-income	 countries.	 Also,	 increased	 global	 economic	
integration	 accelerated	 diffusion	 and	 adoption	 of	 technology,	 which	 in	 turn	 supported	 the	
economic	 boom	 in	 developing	 countries	 before	 the	 recent	 Great	 Recession.7	 The	 resulting	
economic	prosperity	reduced	the	gaps	in	income	per	capita	between	high-income	and	developing	
countries,	which	was	the	main	driver	of	the	reduction	in	global	inequality.		
        Notwithstanding	this	recent	reduction,	the	world	as	a	whole	remains	very	unequal.	In	fact,	
if	the	world	were	a	country	it	would	have	a	highest	Gini	in	2008.	Also,	global	convergence	has	been	
accompanied	with	increasing	national	divergences.	Lakner	and	Milanovic	(2016)	estimates	that	
the	Gini	indices	have	increased	for	many	countries	and	regions	from	about	1988	to	2008:		38.2	to	
41.9%	for	mature	economies;	32.0	to	42.7%	for	China;	31.1	to	33.1%	for	India;	and	53.5	to	58.3

2.2	The	engine	of	the	education	wave:	Education	and	demographic	transitions	by	region	
                                  	
Looking	forward,	what	does	an	increase	of	skilled	labor	supply	driven	by	developing	countries	
mean	 for	 global	 inequality?	 	 The	 first	 step	 in	 the	 analysis	 of	 the	 impact	 of	 the	 forthcoming	
education	wave	is	to	assess	the	geographically	diverse	increases	in	the	supply	of	skilled	workers.	
These	 increases	 depend	 on	 two	 key	 factors:	 the	 intergenerational	 education	 gap	 –	 i.e.	 the	
difference	in	education	attainments	of	the	old	cohorts	that	are	exiting	the	labor	market	vis-à-vis	
the	young	entering	cohorts	–	and	the	intergenerational	demographic	gap	–	i.e.	the	difference	in	
population	size	between	the	young	and	the	old	cohorts.	Large	intergenerational	education	and	
demographic	gaps,	and	thus	a	large	increase	in	the	supply	of	skilled	workers,	are	observed	for	
countries	 that	 have	 boosted	 their	 investment	 in	 education	 and	 that	 have	 still	 high	 population	
growth,	 i.e.	 a	 large	 share	 of	 young	 people.	 Conversely,	 aging	 countries	 where	 most	 of	 their	
population	has	already	entered	advanced	secondary	and	tertiary	education	will	not	experience	
increases	in	the	supply	of	skilled	workers.

        Figure	2	summarizes	the	educational	transition	by	region	from	1960	to	2010.	It	shows	the	
remarkable	and	diverse	developments	in	education	attainment	across	these	regions.	The	average	
years	of	schooling	for	the	young	cohorts	(20-24	years	old)	has	improved	when	compared	to	the	
old	cohorts	(60-64	years	old)	in	all	developing	regions	except	Eastern	Europe	and	Central	Asia.	In	
the	1960s,	young	workers	in	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean,	Middle	East	and	North	Africa,	South	
Asia,	and	Sub-Saharan	Africa	had	about	one	additional	year	of	education	than	their	contemporary	
older	workers.	By	2010,	this	difference	had	increased	to	about	four	or	more	years	of	education,	or	
the	equivalent	of	almost	a	full	cycle	of	secondary	education.	This	trend	is	marginally	different	for	
countries	in	East	Asia	and	the	Pacific	which	started	with	a	slightly	higher	intergenerational	gap	
and	progressed	a	bit	more	slowly.			
         The	lines	in	Figure	2	are	regional	averages,	and	there	is	some	variation	across	countries	
within	each	region.		In	Latin	American	and	the	Caribbean	(LAC),	for	example,	Bolivia,	started	with	
an	intergenerational	education	gap	of	3.5	years	and,	by	2005,	the	gap	rose	to	over	five	years.	This	
trend	is	followed	by	Brazil,	Mexico,	and	Chile.	These	increases	are	evident	both	in	average	years	of	
schooling	as	well	as	in	tertiary	schooling.	In	Bolivia,	the	difference	in	the	average	number	of	years	
of	tertiary	education	between	young	and	old	was	initially	close	to	zero,	but	the	difference	rose	to	
about	a	quarter	of	a	year	by	2005.	For	Benin,	in	Sub-Saharan	Africa	(SSA),	the	difference	in	the	
average	years	of	schooling	for	25-29-year-olds	as	compared	to	60-64-year-olds	was	almost	non-
existent	(0.51	years	vs.	0.48	years)	in	1980.	By	2010,	this	difference	rose	to	1.5	years	of	schooling.8	
Indeed,	this	trend	is	followed	by	other	countries	such	as	Rwanda,	Gambia,	and	Kenya.	Most	of	the	
gains	in	rising	educational	attainment	in	Africa,	however,	are	in	primary	and	secondary	education.	
There	has	been	little	progress	in	increasing	the	rates	of	tertiary	education	and	beyond	(except	in	
a	few	countries,	like	Gabon).		
        Because	China	and	India	have	been	major	drivers	of	recent	declining	global	inequality	as	
well	as	contributors	to	the	global	labor	force,	a	pressing	question	is	whether	future	generations	
will	be	able	to	supply	enough	skilled	workers.	In	China,	the	overall	rate	of	educational	attainment	
and	the	supply	of	young	workers	have	stabilized.	These	numbers	are	reflected	in	Figure	2	in	the	
performance	 of	 East	 Asia	 and	 the	 Pacific,	 where	 the	 average	 years	 of	 schooling	 for	 the	 young	
cohorts	had	improved	significantly	up	to	the	1980s,	with	a	leveling	off	of	the	intergenerational	gap	
after	that.	India’s	educational	attainment	levels	have	been	rising,	although	starting	from	a	lower	
level	than	China’s.	The	difference	in	years	of	schooling	between	young	and	older	cohorts	in	India	
was	1.7	in	1980	and	3.0	in	2005	–with	only	a	small	increase	in	tertiary	education,	which	looks	
weak	in	comparison	to	other	middle-income	countries.	This	observation	is	consistent	with	the	
large	gap	in	average	years	of	schooling	observed	in	South	Asia	(SAR).		
       Two	regions	stand	out	because	of	their	very	different	historical	performance:	the	high-	
income	countries	group	and	Europe	and	Central	Asia.	Both	regions	start	off	in	the	1960s	with	a	
higher	(vis-à-vis	developing	regions)	gap	between	young	and	old	schooling	achievements,	due	to	

8	The	direction	and	magnitude	of	these	differences	are	robust	to	wider	cohort	definitions.			


                                                                                                          7
their	earlier	investment	in	education.	This	gap	increases	in	the	first	two	or	three	decades,	but	then	
decreases	and,	towards	the	end	of	the	period,	the	gap	has	almost	disappeared.	This	trend	should	
not	be	considered	as	lack	of	progress.	On	the	contrary,	once	all	young	people	achieve	a	desired	
(high)	level	of	schooling,	and	this	is	maintained	for	all	new	cohorts,	the	difference	in	education	
between	old	and	the	young	would	disappear.	However,	an	intergenerational	education	gap	close	
to	zero	means	that	the	region-wide	average	education	will	not	increase.	Some	countries,	notably	
the	Russian	Federation,	are	even	experiencing	a	negative	intergenerational	gap	in	education:	older	
cohorts	tend	to	have	more	years	of	education	than	the	young.	Once	the	old	workers	retire,	average	
education	may	go	down.			
        Assuming	that	for	each	old	worker	exiting	the	labor	market	a	new,	young	replaces	him	or	
her,	the	average	education	level	of	the	labor	force	would	increase	in	line	with	the	trends	shown	in	
figure	2.	In	contrast,	some	high-income	OECD	and	East	European	countries	are	either	in	a	stable	
or	even	a	downward	trend	in	terms	of	educational	attainment.	Therefore,	this	education	wave	will	
not	be	uniform	across	regions,	and	developing	countries	will	play	the	leading	role	in	this	process,	
especially	those	with	demographic	bonuses.	For	this	reason,	it	is	critical	to	add	education	by	age	
cohorts,	as	well	as	important	characteristics	such	as	gender,	as	demographic	dimensions	in	long-
term	prospective	economic	analysis	(see	Lutz,	Goujon,	and	Doblhammer-Reiter	1998;	Lutz	and	
Goujon	2003).		
        Remarkably,	the	largest	gap	on	years	of	education	between	generations	is	currently	in	
regions	that	will	contribute	most	to	the	growth	of	global	working	age	population,	namely	LAC,	
Middle	East	and	North	Africa	(MENA),	SAR,	and	SSA.	Moreover,	the	average	years	of	schooling	of	
young	cohorts	in	these	regions,	still	lag	behind	high-income	countries	(HIC),	particularly	SAR	and	
SSA—even	without	getting	into	important	issues	related	to	quality.	Results	from	the	PISA	test	
(OECD,	2015)	suggests	that	the	gap	regarding	education	in	developing	countries	is	not	only	related	
to	 school	 attainment	 but	 more	 importantly	 to	 the	 quality	 of	 education	 when	 comparing	 the	
performance	of	students	using	standard	tests.		While	83%	of	students	from	households	in	the	
bottom	quintile	of	income	distribution	in	Singapore	demonstrate	the	basic	competencies	in	math,	
the	corresponding	numbers	are	below	20%	for	students	from	households	in	the	bottom	quintile	
of	income	distribution	in	Latin	American	countries	(e.g.	Colombia,	Brazil,	and	Peru).	
        In	addition	to	the	younger	generation	becoming	more	educated	than	the	older	one,	the	
magnitude	of	its	effect	on	the	supply	of	skilled	workers	is	enhanced	by	a	growing	cohort’s	size	(of	
that	 working-age	 group).	 In	 a	 similar	 way	 to	 the	 previous	 figure,	 Figure	 2	 shows	 the	
intergenerational	demographic	gap.	This	is	expressed	as	the	ratio	of	the	population	size	of	two	age	
cohorts:	the	young,	aged	20	to	24	and	the	old	aged	60	to	64.		Note	that	these	ratios	vary	both	in	
levels	and	trends.	For	advanced	economies,	and	ECA	countries	the	ratio	at	around	2	is	low	and	
slightly	declining	in	the	period	1960-2010.	This	means	that	new	younger	cohorts	are	still	larger

cohort	coming	from	developing	countries,	especially	regions	that	are	lagging	behind	on	economic	
growth	and	per	capita	income	level.	
        Figures	 2	 and	 3	 can	 be	 extended	 to	 the	 future	 using	 population	 projections	 and	 some	
simple	assumptions	on	education	of	future	young	cohort.	Indeed,	going	forward,	the	proportion	of	
skilled	workers	will	increase	about	43.7%	in	low-	and	middle-income	(LMI)	countries	between	
2015	 and	 2050;	 it	 will	 decline	 approximately	 3.3%	 in	 high-income	 countries	 during	 the	 same	
period.	Moreover,	the	share	of	the	population	from	LMI	countries	was	approximately	82.7%	in	
2015.	By	2050	they	will	represent	about	85.7%	of	total	population.	10		Figure	1	in	the	introduction	
summarizes	how	the	increasing	in	the	number	of	workers	with	more	than	nine	years	of	schooling	
will	be	predominantly	driven	by	countries	in	LMI	regions.		
      The	forthcoming	wave	of	changes	in	the	global	labor	market	will,	therefore,	come	from	the	
combination	and	growing	intensity	of	the	demographic	and	education	transitions	just	described.

workforce	 while	 older,	 less	 educated,	 ones	 leave.	 The	 average	 schooling	 of	 the	 working	 age	
population	 will	 tend	 to	 increase,	 even	 without	 any	 additional	 efforts	 to	 improve	 educational	
attainment	 rates	 –	 a	 pipeline	 effect	 or	 natural	 progression	 as	 students	 move	 up	 from	 one	
educational	grade	to	the	next	over	time.	The	larger	intergenerational	education	gap	in	developing	
countries,	combined	with	the	large	size	and	growing	pool	of	younger	cohorts	relative	to	the	older	
ones	in	those	countries,	forms	the	key	and	significant	dynamics	of	the	second	wave	that	is	analyzed	
in	this	paper.	In	the	next	section,	we	describe	the	methodology	to	quantify	the	effects	of	this	and	
other	related	factors	on	global	inequality.	


    3. Methodology	

3.1	The	global	economic	models	
        	
The	global	distributional	impacts	of	the	education	wave	depend	on	changes	in	per	capita	incomes	
between	countries	and	changes	in	inequality	within	countries.	To	capture	the	full	–	between	and	
within	countries	–	distributional	change,	one	needs	a	framework	that	captures	both	convergences	
at	 the	 macro	 level	 (country	 averages)	 and	 the	 evolution	 of	 factor	 markets	 at	 the	 micro	 level	
(dispersion).	This	paper	adopts	a	dynamic	global	microsimulation	approach	which	allows	taking	
into	account	both	these	average	and	dispersion	effects.			
        The	origin	of	dynamic	microsimulation	can	be	traced	back	to	the	1950s	seminal	work	of	
Orcutt	(1957)	whose	contributions	aimed	at	overcoming	the	limitations	of	models	available	at	that	
time.	These	models	 could	 be	 used	to	 predict	 the	 aggregate	impact,	 but	could	 not	 describe	the	
distributional	impact	of	policy	reforms	or	the	effects	on	inequality	of	long-term	trends,	such	as	
demographic	change.	Data	availability	and	modeling	have	significantly	advanced	since	then,	but	
dynamic	microsimulations	remain	the	main	tool	to	study	distributional	change,	and	still,	provide	
the	unique	perspective	of	projecting	samples	of	population	forward	in	time	(simulating	different	
scenarios).	
        This	 paper	 uses	 the	 World	 Bank’s	 global	 microsimulation	 framework	 labeled	 Global	
Income	Distribution	Dynamics	(GIDD)	model	in	combination	with	the	global	computable	general	
equilibrium	(CGE)	model	called	LINKAGE.	Both	tools	have	been	described	in	detail	in	other	papers	
(e.g.	Bourguignon	et.	al.	2008	and	Bussolo	et.	al.	2010;	the	full	technical	documentation	of	the	
LINKAGE	is	provided	by	van	der	Mensbrugghe,	2011),	but	it	is	still	useful	to	briefly	describe	their	
structure	in	this	section.	The	ultimate	focus	of	analysis	is	household	welfare,	using	household	per	
capita	income	as	its	indicator.	The	distribution	D	of	household	per	capita	income	y	in	year	t	can	be	
expressed	 as	 the	 product	 of	 the	 joint	 distribution	 of	 all	 relevant	 household	 or	 individual	
characteristics	X	and	the	distribution	of	income	conditional	on	these	characteristics:	


                                                                                                        10
     ( )=            =       …           ( )
                                                   ( | ) ( )       		                                        (1)	

where	 ( )	is	the	density	function	of	the	distribution	of	income	and	the	summation	is	over	the	
domain	C(X)	on	which	X		is	defined.	Household	per	capita	income	(y)	can	be	modeled	as	a	function	
of:	(i)	household	members’	characteristics	or	endowments	(X),	(ii)	the	market	reward	for	those	
characteristics	( ),	and	(iii)	the	intensity	in	how	those	endowments	are	used	as	captured	by	a	set	
of	parameters	 	defining	labor	force	participation	and	occupation	status	( | );	and,	finally,	(iv)	
unobservable	components	( ):	

     ,   =       ,   ,       ,       ,         ,       ,                                                     (2)

       The	income	distribution	D		for	a	population	of	N		individuals	or	households	in	year	t	can	be	
represented	by	a	vector	 , … , … , ,	where	each	 Yit	can	be	defined	as	in	(2)	in	terms	of	
endowments,	prices,	labor	status	and	unobservables:		

         =   ,   …       ,       =                 ,   ,   ,   ,   ,    ,   …   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   		   (3)	

         How	does	this	distribution	change	dynamically,	for	example	from	year	t		to	year	t+k?	This	
framework	allows	distinguishing	two	sources	that	affect	the	dynamic	change	of	distribution	 D,		
both	of	which	are	relevant	for	the	assessment	of	the	distributive	impact	of	the	education	wave.	The	
first	source	consists	of	the	changes	in	either	the	parameters	 	or	 ,	namely	the	market	rewards	to	
the	characteristics	 X	and	parameters	affecting	occupational	decisions.	This	means,	for	example,	
that	inequality	for	distribution	D	can	go	down	if	the	skill	premia	      /        	is	reduced;	or	if	a	
change	in	labor	demand	in	sectors	with	higher	wages	(a	change	in	 )	affects	the	decision	to	move	
to	these	sectors	for	some	individuals	working	in	sector	with	lower	wages.	The	second	source	of	
dynamic	 shift	 is	 represented	 by	 changes	 in	 the	 distribution	 of	 individual	 and	 household	
characteristics	(X).	Alterations	of	the	structure	of	the	population	in	terms	of	age	and	 education,	
and	changes	in	the	size	and	composition	of	households,	will	all	affect	the	distribution	of	income	of	
that	population.11		
         Both	sources	of	distributional	change	matter	to	the	impact	of	the	education	wave.	In	fact,	
the	GIDD	allows	generating	a	scenario	that	includes	the	education	wave,	which	is	then	compared	
to	 a	 counterfactual	 where	 education	 achievements	 remain	 stable	 at	 the	 levels	 observed	 in	 t.

Comparing	 the	 distributions	                   and	         	 derived	 from	 the	 two	 scenarios	 in	
effect	isolates	the	distributional	impact	of	the	education	wave.	Defining	the	contrasting	values	of	
endowments,	prices,	and	labor	status	to	build	the	two	 s		can	be	quite	challenging,	especially	when	
done	globally	for	many	countries.	To	do	so,	the	functional	form	of	equation	(2)	is	defined	in	a	
simple	fashion	using	only	independent	variables	available	for	all	countries	in	the	sample.	In	this	

11
  These	two	sources	of	dynamic	change	are	not	independent	one	from	the	other	and,	in	the	real	world,	they	are	
simultaneously	determined.	The	problem	of	estimating	and	running	a	fully	simultaneous	microsimulation	framework	is	
overcome	by	making	some	simplifying	assumptions.	

                                                                                                                    11

the	agricultural	sector	or	in	the	non-agricultural	sector,	respectively;	 	captures	the	proportion	
of	household	members	in	each	of	the	 k		age	cohorts.	The	 s	are	rewards	(prices)	to	education

where	 the	 demographic	 characteristics,	 endowments,	 and	 returns	 to	 these	 endowments	 have	
been	 modified	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 counterfactual	 scenarios	 of	 the	 education	 wave	 and	 no	
wave.	 Using	 (5)	 –	 and	 the	 relevant	 simulated	 S,	 E,	 F,	 s,	 and	 s	 –	 the	 two	 distributions	
          _               _
                	and	           can	be	generated.		
        To	close	the	model,	one	needs	to	figure	out	how	the	characteristics,	represented	by	the	
various	dummies,	evolve	through	time	as	well	as	how	the	rewards,	represented	by	the	 s,	change	
in	the	scenarios.	Characteristics	and	rewards	should	be	jointly	determined;	however,	this	is	not	
the	case	for	the	GIDD,	nor	for	the	majority	of	microsimulation	models.13	In	practice,	the	GIDD	
implements	 the	 sequential	 approach	 described	 in	 Figure	 A1	 in	 the	 appendix.	 In	 the	 first	 step,	
changes	in	the	number	of	skilled	and	unskilled	workers	are	estimated	on	the	basis	of	demographic	
change	and	the	pipeline	effect	described	before.14	In	a	second	step,	these	aggregates	are	used	as:	
(i)	 constraints	 for	 the	 reweighting	 procedure	 that	 is	 applied	 to	 change	 the	 distribution	 of	
characteristics	 at	 the	 household	 level;	 and	 (ii)	 as	 inputs	 for	 the	 LINKAGE	 general	 equilibrium	
model.		
The	equation	here	below	summarizes	the	reweighting	procedure:

   Note	that	unskilled	workers	employed	in	agriculture,	i.e.	when	these	dummies	 , , 	are	equal	to	one,	are	the	
reference	category,	so	they	are	excluded	from	the	equation.	
13	See	Bourguignon	and	Bussolo	(2011)	for	a	discussion.	
14	These	changes	are	assumed	to	be	exogenous	and	not	affected	by	the	rewards.	Bourguignon	and	Bussolo	(2011)	

describes	more	complex	structures,	where	changes	in	characteristics	affect	the	rewards,	and	then	these	affect	the	supply.

    , 	and	 , ,	the	supply	of	skilled	or	unskilled	workers	in	year	t+k,		are	the	constraints	of	the	
reweighting	procedure	which	consists	of	finding	multipliers	ai,s,t+k	that	change	the	original	(i.e.	for	
year	t)	household	weights	wi,s.	Once	these	multipliers	are	determined,	the	dummies	 , 	can	be	
recomputed	and	used	to	calculate	a	‘partial’	change	in	the	distribution.	Formally,	equation	(5)	can	
be	re-written	as:	

 ′,         =       +         ,   ,         	 ′,        ,            +       ,           ,   	 ′,       ,

This	new	equation	(5’)	represents	a	change	in	the	incomes,	and	thus	in	the	distribution,	that	is	due	
to	a	pure	demographic	(or	quantity)	education	effect.	Other	characteristics	and	rewards	have	not	
been	changed	yet.15	
         The	change	in	rewards,	in	this	specific	case,	the	change	of	the	skill	premia,	is	determined	in	
the	 LINKAGE	 general	 equilibrium	 model.	 This	 model	 calculates	 wages	 of	 skilled	and	 unskilled	
workers	by	combining	firms’	demand	for	labor	with	the	aggregate	change	in	supplies	of	these	two	
types	 of	 workers.	 In	 addition	 to	 the	 changes	 in	 rewards,	 the	 computable	 general	 equilibrium	
model	also	calculates	overall	economic	growth,	sectoral	reallocation	of	labor,	and	a	new	vector	of	
consumer	prices.	Changes	of	these	variables	–	the	Linkage	Aggregate	Variables	(LAVs)	–	are	used	
as	inputs	in	the	final	step	of	the	microsimulation.	This	step	consists	of	changing	the	 s	in	equation	
(5’).16	
            	
3.2	The	micro	data	underlying	the	models	and	the	analysis	
            	
The	 methodology	 combines	 a	 large	 data	 set	 from	 three	 different	 sources,	 which	 we	 describe	
further	to	highlight	the	innovation.	First,	we	use	population	projections	from	UN	(2015).	Second,	
we	use	input-output	matrices	from	the	Global	Trade	Analysis	Project	(GTAP,	2011)	for	the	CGE	
scenarios.	Third,	we	use	the	GIDD	database,	which	is	composed	by	harmonized	household	surveys	

15
    Note	 that	 the	 constraints	 of	 the	 reweighting	 procedure	 are	 in	 terms	 of	 (age	 cohorts	 and)	 education	 levels	 of	 the	
population	in	year	t+k,	and	not	in	terms	of	sectoral	employment.	However,	because	skilled	workers	may	initially	be	more	
concentrated	in	the	non-agricultural	sectors,	increasing	the	weight	of	skilled	workers	in	the	total	population	generates	also	
an	increase	in	the	share	of	non-agricultural	employment.	This	is	why,	in	equation	(5’),	sectoral	dummies	are	labelled	as	
 ′ , 	 ′ , 	with	a	prime	(’)	sign.	These	do	not	necessarily	represent	the	final	sectoral	employment	which	is	determined	
by	the	CGE	model.						
16	 In	 this	 last	 step,	 workers	 move	 across	 sectors	 to	 achieve	 the	 proportions	 of	 employment	 in	 agriculture	 and	 non-

agriculture	calculated	by	the	CGE	model.	Note	that	these	inter-sectoral	movements	are	net	of	the	sectoral	shifts	already	
generated	by	the	reweighting	procedure	as	mention	in	footnote	15.	The	microsimulation	procedure	to	select	which	specific	
worker	moves	is	based	on	a	probabilistic	model	described	in	detail	in	Bussolo	et	al	(2010).

         From	 the	 household	 surveys,	 we	 extract	 information	 on	 individuals’	 age,	 employment	
status,	 sector	 of	 activity,	 years	 of	 schooling	 and	 wage	 as	 the	 starting	 points	 to	 project	 the	
population	growth	by	school	attainment	and	the	sectoral	wage	bill	database	(Cruz,	Go	and	Osorio-
Rodarte,	2017).	These	pieces	of	information	feed	into	the	LINKAGE	model	to	establish	consistency	
between	 the	 skill	 definition	 and	 volume	 of	 workers	 between	 the	 CGE	 model	 and	 the	
microsimulations.20	Table	2	shows	the	share	of	workers	by	broad	sectors	(agriculture	and	non-
agriculture)	and	skill	level	for	2012.	The	tabulation	indicates	that	the	share	of	skilled	workers	is	
much	larger	in	high-income	countries	and	the	region	of	Europe	&	Central	Asia	(ECA).	The	three	
regions	of	East	Asia	&	Pacific	(EAP),	South	Asia	(SAS),	and	Sub-Saharan	Africa	(SSA)	together	had	
approximately	96%	of	the	people	living	below	poverty	line	in	2015.		In	all	of	these	regions,	35%	or	
more	of	the	paid	workers	were	unskilled	working	in	agriculture.	An	important	channel	through	
which	 changes	 in	 the	 composition	 of	 labor	 supply	 may	 affect	 income	 inequality	 and	 income	
distribution,	in	the	long	run,	is	the	movement	of	workers	across	different	categories	delineated	by	
the	cells	-	agriculture,	non-agriculture,	skilled	workers,	and	unskilled	workers.				


17	 The	 data	 include	 household	 surveys	 harmonized	 by	 the	 Poverty	 Group	 Global	 Practice	 of	 the	 World	 Bank	 and	 the	
International	 Income	 Distribution	 Database	 (I2D2).	 The	 I2D2	 is	 a	 World	 Bank	 project	 to	 collate,	 harmonize	 and	 make	
accessible	 comparable	 information	 from	 household	 surveys	 held	 by	 the	 World	 Bank,	 for	 poverty,	 inequality,	 education,	
demographics,	and	labor	market	analysis.	For	further	details	on	I2D2,	see	Montenegro	and	Maximilian	(2008).	
18	For	each	country,	the	closest	survey	to	2011	has	been	chosen	to	be	consistent	with	the	database	used	in	the	LINKAGE	
model	(Global	Trade	Analysis	database	v.8).	From	this	dataset	we	derived	the	GIDD	Sectoral	Wage	Bill	database	(Cruz,	Go,	
and	Osório-Rodarte,	2017).	
19	 If	 Japan	 and	 Switzerland	 are	 included	 with	 aggregated	 information	 generated	 from	 household	 surveys,	 using	 the	
Luxemburg	Income	Study	data	set,	the	GDP	coverage	increases	to	approximately	93%.	
20	One	issue	is	the	comparability	of	school	attainment	to	define	skill-level	because	of	differences	in	quality	of	education	
across	countries.	However,	the	differences	of	wages	by	skill,	sector,	and	country	indirectly	account	for	the	differences	in	
respective	productivity.

                                                                                                                                                                             15
       Table	3	shows	that	there	are	significant	differences	in	the	average	wages	of	workers	
(conditional	 on	 their	 level	 of	 skill)	 between	 sectors	 and	 regions.21	 An	 average	 unskilled	
worker	in	non-agriculture	in	high-income	countries	has	a	wage	that	is	significantly	higher	
than	 an	 average	 skilled	 worker	 in	 a	 non-high-income	 economy.	 Also,	 skill	 premia	 in	 the	
wages	by	sector	are	sharply	characterized.	22	

3.3	The	scenarios	

Using	 the	 methodology	 just	 described,	 we	 first	 define	 the	 “education	 wave”	 scenario	 as	 the	
baseline	 or	 reference	 case.	 On	 current	 global	 trends,	 the	 education	 wave	 foretells	 substantial	
changes	in	the	global	labor	market.		Around	2012,	one	skilled	worker	from	a	high-income	(OECD)	
country	was	competing,	in	the	global	labor	market,	with	two	skilled	workers	from	developing	
countries.	In	less	than	a	generation,	by	2030,	that	ratio	will	be	1	to	3,	confirming	that	the	global	
pool	of	skilled	workers	will	originate	mostly	in	developing	countries	as	a	direct	consequence	of	
the	education	and	demographic	transitions	(as	discussed	in	section	2).	This	trend	is,	in	essence,	
the	global	shock	of	the	education	wave	that	will	likely	transform	once	again,	as	the	‘great	doubling’	
did	in	the	first	wave,	the	world’s	labor	market.	

        Digging	beyond	this	global	picture,	the	education	wave	will	also	affect	distribution	within	
countries,	a	local	shock	that	will	vary	from	country	to	country.		Figure	4	illustrates	the	geographic	
dispersion	of	the	education	wave	with	the	growth	rates	of	skilled	labor	(y-axis)	against	those	for	
unskilled	labor	(x-axis).		Most	of	the	dots,	which	represent	countries	or	regions,	are	above	the	45-
degree	line,	meaning	that	skilled	workers	will	grow	faster	than	that	of	unskilled	workers.		

        Yet,	there	is	heterogeneity	across	countries.		First,	the	growth	rate	of	unskilled	workers	is	
often	negative	in	‘older’	countries	and	region.	Compare,	for	example,	the	reduction	rates	of	30%	
or	 15%	 for	 unskilled	 populations	 in	 Europe	 or	 China,	 versus	 the	 expansion	 rates	 of	 53%	 for	
Nigeria,	or	65%	for	the	Sub-Saharan	region.	Second,	very	few	countries	or	regions	experience	
growth	rates	that	are	similar	for	the	two	groups	of	workers	(that	is,	no	education	wave):	the	only	
dots	in	the	figure	that	are	(reasonably)	close	to	the	45-degree	line	are	those	for	the	US,	Russian	
Federation,	and	Sub-Saharan	Africa.	For	most	of	the	other	countries,	however,	the	differences	can	
be	 quite	 large.	 In	 Turkey,	 the	 gap	 between	 the	 rates	 of	 expansion	 of	 skilled	 and	 unskilled	
populations	 is	 of	 almost	 50	 percentage	 points.	 For	 Brazil	 and	 Nigeria,	 the	 gap	 is	 close	 to	 40	
percentage	points,	for	Indonesia,	India,	China	is	between	25	and	33	percentage	points.	The	Russian	
Federation	is	the	only	country	found	below	the	45-degree	line,	albeit	close	to	it.	In	this	country,	
older	generations	tend	to	have	more	education	than	the	younger	ones.	This	fact,	combined	with	




21	Heterogeneity	is	large	within	regions	and	within	countries,	which	are	accounted	for	in	the	components	of	global	income	
inequality.		
22	The	wages	for	skilled	workers	in	agriculture	are	higher	than	the	wages	for	unskilled	workers	in	the	same	sector.	The	
same	happens	in	non-agriculture	activities.		

                                                                                                                      16
an	aging	population,	generates	a	rate	of	reduction	of	skilled	workers	slightly	higher	than	that	of	
unskilled	workers,	resulting	in	a	(negative)	gap	of	3	percentage	points.

the	 strong	 assumption	 that	 labor	 supply	 is	 exogenous	 and	 that	 it	 follows	 demographic	
developments	is	adopted	here.	In	fact,	most	economic	models	likewise	treat	population	growth	as	
exogenous	and,	in	this	exercise,	labor	supply	by	education	level	is	indirectly	derived	from	the	aging	
of	the	population	and	by	assuming	that	the	education	attainment	of	the	young	cohorts	in	the	future	
will	 adhere	 to	 the	 same	 attainment	 rate	 observed	 in	 the	 current	 data.	 This	 assumption	 is	
conservative	because	some	countries	will	likely	do	better.	That	is,	their	education	policy	may	bring	
about	better	educational	attainment	among	the	young	generations	in	the	future	when	compared	
to	those	in	the	present	period.	The	education	wave,	if	such	improvement	is	accounted	for,	would

wave),	a	“no	education	wave”	is	set	up	as	the	main	counterfactual	simulation,	which	is	a	what-if

In	the	simulations,	the	productivity	factor	for	each	country	is	set	exogenously	to	replicate	the	
evolution	of	economic	growth	to	2030	based	on	the	World	Bank	projections	reported	in	the	
Global	 Monitoring	 Report	 2015/16	 (World	 Bank,	 2015).	 The	catching	up	of	productivity	of	
developing	countries	to	the	levels	of	high-income	countries	generates	faster	growth	rates	for	the	
developing	countries.	The	growth	differential	vis-à-vis	high-income	countries	is	quite	pronounced	
for	the	East	Asia	and	the	Pacific	region	as	well	as	for	South	Asia	region.	These	differentials	bring

country	component	of	global	inequality.		The	increasing	of	the	working	age	population	shares	in	
many	 developing	 countries,	 vis-à-vis	 its	 reduction	 in	 high	 income	 countries	 also	 contributes	
towards	this	convergence	(Cruz	and	Ahmed,	2016).

        Is	 the	 education	 wave	 contributing	 to	 the	 reduction	 of	 global	 inequality	 from	 the	
perspective	of	this	between-country	convergence?	The	answer	is	yes,	but	it	does	not	seem	much	
in	the	aggregate	as	shown	in	Figure	6.	The	contribution	of	the	education	wave	–	vis-à-vis	a	scenario	
where	skilled	and	unskilled	workers	grow	at	the	same	rate	–	comes	exclusively	from	the	higher	
productivity	of	skilled	workers	who	are	becoming	more	abundant	in	the	wave	scenario.	However,	
other	drivers	of	growth	and	convergence,	namely	the	catching	up	of	productivity	and	supplies	of	
other	factors	(land	and	capital),	do	not	change	across	simulations.	For	these	reasons,	the	education	
wave	boosts	convergence	by,	at	best,	about	one	percentage	point	in	East	Asia	and	the	Pacific	and	
Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	regions,	but	its	impact	is	more	limited	in	other	regions.	The	
convergence	differentials	should	be	considered	a	lower	bound,	given	that	more	abundant	skilled	
workers	 are	 likely	 to	 generate	 externalities	 and	 an	 additional	 productivity	 uptick	 that	 is	 not	
simulated	here.		In	addition,	we	have	very	conservative	education	projections	and	we	a	looking	at	
a	relatively	short	period	of	time	to	fully	capture	the	effects	of	the	education	wave.

        One	final	point	on	the	regional	aggregate	growth	rates.	The	education	wave,	as	discussed	
above,	is	a	scenario	where	the	growth	of	the	global	pool	of	skilled	workers	is	almost	entirely	due	
to	the	expansion	of	education	in	developing	countries.	Indeed,	by	2030	for	all	developing	countries	
incomes	per	capita	are	higher	in	the	wave	versus	than	in	the	no-wave	scenario,	while	for	the	rich	
countries	 incomes	 are	 unchanged.	 Further	 to	 the	 rising	 inequality	 in	 high-income	 countries	
observed	by	several	authors	(see	footnote	4),	the	micro	results	below	suggest	that	increasing	
pressure	on	the	middle-income	classes	of	high-income	countries	will	continue.			

        Changes	in	the	skill	and	sector	premium	of	wages	are	the	other	crucial	macroeconomic	
results	of	the	simulations	that	affect	global	inequality	through	its	effects	on	incomes	dispersion	
within	each	country.		Wages	will	follow	the	interaction	of	the	demand	and	supply	of	labor	by	skill	
and	sector	as	well	as	the	economy-wide	repercussions	of	other	factors	in	general	equilibrium.			

        For	each	country,	a	higher	supply	of	skilled	workers	in	2030	relative	to	2012	will	lead	to	a	
larger	reduction	in	the	skill	premium	(Figure	7).		The	regression	that	relates	the	relative	size	of	the	
skill	premium	against	the	relative	supply	of	skilled	labor	has	a	well-defined	negative	slope.	The	
causality	in	this	framework	runs	from	the	changes	in	the	quantities	of	workers	to	the	changes	in	
the	wages	because	all	labor	supplies	are	exogenous.	Turkey,	Brazil,	and	South	Africa	are	amongst	
the	countries	with	the	largest	drops	in	the	skill	premium.	In	Turkey,	the	skill	premium	by	2030	is	
reduced	by	20	percent	of	what	it	was	in	2012.	At	the	opposite	end,	the	premium	increases	by	about	
5	percent	in	the	Russian	Federation.	In	general,	the	skill	premium	will	tend	to	decrease	across	
countries.

China	(CHN),	India	(IND),	Indonesia	(IDN),	Japan	(JPN),	Mexico	(MEX),	Nigeria	(NGA),	Russia	(RUS),	South	Africa	(ZAF),	Sri	Lanka

(EUR).		For	other	regions,	we	follow	the	World	Bank	classification,	including	East	Asia	and	Pacific	(EAP),	East	Europe	and	Central	Asia	
(ECA),	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean	(LAC),	Middle	East	and	North	of	Africa	(MENA),	and	South	Asia	(SAR),	combined	to	the	
demographic	typology	described	in	Ahmed	(2016),	which	divide	countries	according	to	their	potential	for	demographic	dividend	by	
2030,	 such	 as	 as:	 early-dividend	 (ed),	 late	 divided	 (lt),	 and	 post-divided	 (pd).	 This	 disaggregation	 is	 based	 on	 the	 CGE	 macro-
simulation.	

         Changes	in	the	premium	of	wages	by	sector	also	affect	distributional	shift.		By	sector,	we	
refer	to	urban	(non-agriculture)	and	rural	(agriculture)	areas.		In	high-income	countries,	both	
skilled	and	unskilled	workers	are	perfectly	mobile	across	sectors	so	that	a	single,	skill-specific,	
economy-wide	wage	clears	each	labor	market.	In	developing	countries,	on	the	other	hand,	skilled	
workers	are	perfectly	mobile	while	unskilled	workers	are	segmented	by	the	two	broad	sectors.		A	
single	wage	clears	for	skilled	workers	clears	across	sectors	but	not	the	case	for	unskilled	workers.	
In	the	latter	case,	a	migration	function	that	allows	unskilled	workers	to	move	from	the	rural	to	the	
urban	sector	defines	the	supplies	of	unskilled	workers	across	sectors,	in	the	tradition	of	Lewis	
(1954)	 and	 Harris	 and	 Todaro	 (1970).	 	 Interactions	 with	 the	 sectoral	 demands	 for	 unskilled	
workers	 then	 determine	 the	 wages,	 with	 a	 premium	 prevailing	 for	 urban	 (non-agriculture)	
unskilled	workers	relative	to	their	counterparts	in	the	rural	(agriculture)	sector.		Unlike	the	skill	
composition	of	labor,	the	sector	distribution	of	unskilled	workers	is	endogenous.

         As	each	country	urbanizes,	production	and	income	growth,	as	well	as	 the	allocation	of	
unskilled	workers,	will	all	shift	towards	non-agricultural	sectors.23		Even	so,	the	urban	premium	
for	unskilled	workers	will	still	tend	to	go	down	due	to	the	relative	intensities	of	factor	use	in	the	
production	function	across	sectors.	That	is,	agriculture,	which	is	more	intensive	in	the	unskilled	
factor,	 will	 release	 many	 more	 unskilled	 workers	 than	 those	 needs	 by	 the	 expanding	 non-
agriculture	 sectors,	 resulting	 in	 a	 relative	 oversupply	 of	 unskilled	 workers,	 driving	 down	 the	
premium	for	unskilled	workers	in	the	urban	sector.		Figure	8	depicts	the	reduction	of	the	urban	
premium	of	wages	in	2030	relative	to	2012	against	the	relative	sector	supply	of	unskilled	workers.

    Demand	 for	 workers	 by	 the	 different	 sectors	 is	 in	 line	 with	 firms’	 production	 plans	 which	 in	 turn	 depend	 on	
consumers,	export	and	other	final	demands.	Due	to	income	growth	–	and	an	elasticity	with	respect	to	income	above	one	
of	 consumption	 of	 non-agricultural	 goods	 –	 demand	 for	 manufacturing	 goods	 and	 services	 (i.e.	 demand	 for	 non-
agricultural	 goods)	 increases	 more	 rapidly	 than	 demand	 for	 agricultural	 commodities.	 This	 shift	 of	 demand	 is	
transmitted	to	production,	and	consequently	demand	for	labor	in	non-agricultural	sectors	increases	faster	than	that	in	
agriculture.

4.2	Results	at	the	micro	level	

          Between-	and	within-	country	evolution	of	inequality		

         Using	the	macro	results	about	average	income	convergence	and	changes	in	wage	premia,	
the	microsimulation	part	of	the	economic	framework	estimates	the	impact	of	the	education	wave	
at	the	household	level.24	The	microsimulation	results	confirm	that	the	world	will	become	more	
equal	by	2030	as	it	becomes	more	educated	(Table	5).	The	(individual-based)	Gini	index	falls	
from	 65.8	 in	 2012	 to	 62.6	 in	 2030,	 while	 the	 Theil-L	 index	 is	 reduced	 from	 90.7	 to	 76.6.	
Compared	to	recent	patterns,	these	results	suggest	a	continuation	of	the	reduction	in	global	
inequality.	During	the	great	doubling	of	the	global	labor	force,	global	inequality	decreased	
by	 2.3	 percentage	 points	 in	 a	 20-year	 interval	 from	 1988	 to	 2008	 (Lakner	 and	 Milanovic	
2016).	Our	education	wave	scenario	shows	a	comparable	reduction	of	3.2	percentage	point,	
with	the	global	Gini	index	falling	during	the	period	2012	to	2030.		The	Theil-L	index	also	
suggests	a	similar	reduction	of	close	to	14	percentage	points	by	2030.	Compared	to	Lakner	
and	Milanovic	(2016),	our	initial	measure	of	Gini	and	Theil-L	indices	are	smaller,	which	may	
be	 explained	 by	 differences	 in	 benchmark	 year,	 data	 sources,	 country	 coverage,	 and	 the	
slight	improvement	in	equality	when	the	education	wave	is	measured	by	2012.25

   The microsimulation exercise is done at the country level using household surveys, but results in this section are
aggregated to analyze inequality at the global level. The CGE macro results provide yearly simulations from 2011 to
2030. The microsimulation uses 2012 as a reference year for the harmonized household surveys. Thus, this section
uses projections from 2012 to 2030 for the microsimulation exercises.
25
   The	latest	year	available	in	Lakner	and	Milanovic	(2016)	is	2008	for	which	the	Gini	is	70.5.		Our	initial	year	is	2011,	
for	which	our	Gini	index	is	65.8.	Thus,	we	focus	the	comparison	on	relative	changes.	Ferreira	et.	al.	(2015)	describe	the	
differences	across	several	cross-national	inequality	databases.	

                                                                                                                                               23
of	 Table	5	shows	the	results	of	this	decomposition	when	the	groups	are	represented	by	either	
regions	or	countries.	26	A	clear	answer	emerges:	global	inequality	decreases	mainly	because,	
on	average,	poorer	countries	are	catching	up.	At	the	beginning	of	the	period,	the	contribution	
of	the	‘between-groups’	component	to	total	inequality	is	more	than	50	percent	(52	percent	
when	using	regions,	57	percent	when	using	countries	as	groups).	However,	by	the	end	of	the	
period,	the	between-country	component	drops	to	the	less	than	50	percent	(due	to	income	
convergence)	while	the	within-countries	component	shows	a	larger	contribution	to	global	
inequality.	This	result	does	not	imply	that	inequality	within	countries	is	increasing	(more	on	
this	below),	but	that,	at	least,	inequality	between	countries	is	decreasing	at	a	faster	pace.	
Poor	and	large	countries,	such	as	India	and	China,	are	growing	fast	to	reshaping	the	global	
income	distribution	and	contributing	to	the	reduction	of	global	inequality.		

        The	importance	of	the	education	wave	in	the	dynamics	of	inequality	within	countries	
can	 be	 seen	 by	 comparing	 the	 results	 of	 the	 education	 wave	 with	 those	 of	 the	 no-wave	
scenario	in	the	last	two	columns	of	 Table	5.	The	larger	decreases	of	the	skill	premium	in	the	
education	wave	scenario	pushes	down	inequality	within	countries,	while	this	is	not	the	case	in	the	
no-wave	scenario.	As	a	result,	the	within-group	component	in	the	no-wave	scenario,	as	well	as	
total	inequality,	are	higher	than	those	in	the	education	wave.		

        Comparing	the	global	growth	incidence	curves	(GICs)	for	the	education	wave	and	the	no-
wave	scenarios	is	another	way	of	illustrating	the	change	in	the	global	distribution	(Figure	10).	The	
GICs	differ	from	the	elephant	curve	of	Lakner	and	Milanovic	(2016)	in	that	they	do	not	have	the	
trunk	part.	The	reasons	are:	the	microsimulations	are	based	on	labor	incomes,27	and	there	are	no	
corrections	 for	 top	 incomes	 (which	 are	 not	 recorded	 in	 the	 underlying	 household	 surveys).	
Moreover,	our	2	sectors	by	2	levels	of	skilled	workers	do	not	provide	enough	heterogeneity	to	
capture	effects	on	the	top	income.		




26	The	regions	are:	Sub-Saharan	Africa,	Middle-East	and	North	Africa,	South	Asia,	East	Asia	and	the	Pacific,	Europe	and	

Central	Asia,	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean,	High	Income	countries.	These	regions	correspond	to	the	World	Bank	
definitions.				
27
   Note that household surveys often, if not always, record non-labor incomes. The microsimulations apply the
country-specific average growth rate to change these non-labor incomes. The change in the returns of capital from
the global CGE could be also used, but this was not done in the current exercise. A main reason is that most of the
non-labor incomes are (public and private) transfers and thus do not represents incomes from capital.

         These	 GICs	 highlight	 several	 interesting	 points.	 First,	 the	 education	 wave	 provides	 its	
highest	benefits	for	the	population	with	incomes	between	the	bottom	20	and	top	20;	growth	rates	
for	the	groups	at	the	two	extremes	of	the	distribution	are	1	to	2	percentage	points	lower	than	for	
the	group	in	the	middle.	Second,	the	no-	education	wave	rates	of	income	expansion	are	below	
those	of	the	education	wave	scenario	for	everyone	with	incomes	up	to	about	the	90th	percentile.	
This	 is	 expected	 as	 the	 education	 wave	 is	 mainly	 a	 wave	 in	 the	 developing	 world.	 Third,	 the	
distance	between	the	two	lines	appears	small	but,	for	the	middle	of	the	distribution	and	the	bottom	
5	percent,	the	difference	should	not	be	underestimated.	In	fact,	half	a	percentage	point	gap	in	
growth	rates	accumulates	to	10	percent	larger	incomes	after	20	years,	a	non-trivial	difference.	

        We	also	analyze	the	changes	in	the	country	composition	of	the	bottom	20-	and	the	top-20	
percent	 of	 the	 global	 income	 distribution	 by	 2030	 (table	 A1	 of	 the	 appendix).	 In	 2012,	 eight	
countries	made	up	three-quarters	of	the	population	in	the	bottom	20	of	the	global	distribution.	
And	India	and	China	alone	accounted	for	almost	50	percent	of	it.	Most	of	the	other	countries	in	the	
bottom	were	from	Sub-Saharan	Africa.	For	some	of	these	countries	almost	their	entire	national	
populations	(or	large	shares	of	them)	belonged	to	the	global	bottom	20.	While	only	15	percent	of	
Chinese	nationals	occupied	the	global	bottom	20,	97	percent	of	the	South	African	citizens	resided	
in	the	bottom	20,	82	per	cent	of	those	from	Congo,	and	60	percent	of	Nigerians.	The	composition	
changes	significantly	by	2030.	Notably,	China	disappears	while	India	still	contributes	one-quarter	
to	the	total	world	population	in	the	bottom	20.	India’s	number	corresponds	to	23	percent	of	the	
total	population	of	India,	not	30	percent	as	in	2012.	A	similar	evolution	can	be	described	for	the	
top	20.	With	the	arrival	of	China	in	2030,	a	large	percentage	of	citizens	from	the	US	and	from	
Western	European	countries	will	lose	their	top	positions.

        The	 education	 wave	 also	 has	 strong	 influences	 on	 within	 countries	 distributions.	 For	
example,	a	steep	downward	sloped	incidence	curve	for	the	education	wave	is	observed	in	Turkey	
(Figure	 10)	 while	 an	 upward	 sloping	 one	 is	 registered	 for	 other	 countries,	 such	 as	 Russia.		
However,	the	growth	incidence	curve	of	Turkey	for	the	full	shock	(the	solid	line)	seems	rather	flat.	
The	main	reason	is	that	the	demographic	shock	in	Turkey	is	regressive.28	This	demographic	effect	
generates	 the	 dotted	 regressive	 incidence	 curve	 shown	 in	 Figure 10.29	 The	 fact	 that	 the	
demographic	impact	is	regressive	should	not	be	too	surprising.	Deaton	and	Paxson	(1998)	show	
that	there	is	a	quite	strong	age	effect	on	inequality,	meaning	that	as	cohorts	age	their	inequality	
increases.	Thus,	older	societies	(which	is	the	case	for	Turkey	in	2030	vis-à-vis	2012,	and	in	fact	for	
all	countries)	are	expected	to	be	more	unequal.		The	effect	of	the	wage	premia	–	that	is	driven	by	
the	 education	 wave	 –	 shows,	 as	 expected,	 a	 progressive	 GIC.	 This	 effect	 can	 be	 inferred	 by	
estimating	the	difference	between	the	demographic	and	the	full	effect	GICs.	Yet,	the	‘net’	GIC	for	
the	no-wave	scenario	is	also	flat	(Figure	A2	in	the	appendix).

   We	reweight	the	households	so	that	the	simulated	population	matches,	in	terms	of	its	shares	of	age	and	education	
groups,	the	projected	2030	demographic	structure	is	not	distributional	neutral.	In	fact,	households	with	older	and	more	
educated	members	get	reweighted	more	heavily	than	other	households.	
29
    Note	 that	 the	 dotted	 GIC	 also	 includes	 the	 effect	 of	 the	 inter-sectoral	 reallocations	 of	 unskilled	 workers	 and	 a	
distributionally	neutral	residual	growth	effect	(so	that	the	average	growth	for	the	population	as	a	whole	is	the	actual	growth	
of	the	period).	It	is	possible	to	decompose	this	GIC	further	and	isolate	the	pure	demographic	effect,	but	the	observation	in	
the	main	text	will	not	change	since	the	sectoral	reallocation	effects	are	of	negligible	importance.

        In	the	case	of	China,	the	growth	incidence	curve	is	shaped	as	an	inverted	U	due	to	the	
demographic	 effect,	 and	 the	 change	 in	 skill	 and	 urban	 premium	 are	 jointly	 and	 slightly	
regressive	(Figure	11).	The	expansion	of	the	skilled	workers	in	China	will	occur	in	the	middle	
of	the	distribution	(see	Figure	A3	in	the	appendix).	For	each	percentile	of	the	population,	we	
compare	 the	 share	 of	 workers	 that	 are	 skilled	 and	 unskilled	 both	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	
period	and	at	the	end	of	the	period	during	the	education	wave	(Figure	A3a).	This	comparison	
tells	us	that	most	of	the	skilled	are	towards	the	top	and	most	of	the	unskilled	towards	the	
bottom,	but	also	that	the	shift	caused	by	the	education	wave	is	concentrated	in	the	middle	of	
the	 income	 distribution.	 We	 also	 find	 that	 skilled	 workers	 expand	 in	 the	 middle	 and	
substitute	for	the	contraction	of	the	unskilled,	also	in	the	middle	of	the	income	distribution	
(Figure	A3b).	In	the	case	of	China,	it	is	mainly	a	story	of	quantity,	more	than	of	prices.		

        A	 final	 graph	 for	 the	 US	 (Figure	 12)	 illustrates	 what	 may	 happen	 to	 high	 income	
countries.	The	graph	shows	the	density	distribution	for	the	US	population	by	plotting	the	
percentages	of	the	US	population	that	are	found	at	different	levels	of	income.	These	levels	of	
income	 are	 shown	 in	 the	 graph	 not	 as	 actual	 USD	 amounts,	 but	 as	 the	 corresponding	
percentiles	of	the	global	income	distribution.	So	clearly,	most	of	the	US	population	is	found	
at	the	top	of	the	world	distribution.	However,	it	is	interesting	to	note	that	the	US	will	lose	its	
dominance	at	the	top	and,	by	2030,	a	larger	share	of	the	US	citizens	will	be	in	lower	positions.	
This	is	a	result	of	both	income	convergence	across	countries	(citizens	from	other	countries	
will	start	occupying	the	higher	positions	in	the	world	distribution	of	income),	but	also	of	the	
pressure	on	the	upper	middle-income	class	in	the	US.

        Notwithstanding	the	potential	pressures	on	high	income	countries,	overall	the	education	
wave	will	be	pushing	down	inequality	within	countries.	The	Gini	index	is	lower	for	almost	all	
countries	in	the	education	wave	when	compared	to	the	case	of	the	no	education	wave.	Figure	13	
plots	the	difference	in	the	Gini	index	by	2030	between	the	education	wave	and	no	education-
wave	 scenarios	 for	 each	 country.	 A	 negative	 number	 denotes	 less	 inequality	 (an	
improvement)	brought	about	by	the	education	wave.		For	most	of	the	117	countries	covered,	
changes	in	the	within-country	inequality	are	clearly	more	favorable	with	the	education	wave.		
Although	 the	 improvement	 did	 not	 completely	 reverse	 the	increase	 in	 the	 overall	 within-
country	inequality	by	2030	(as	shown	in	Table	6),	it	clearly	ameliorates	the	deterioration.30

  Even if the Gini indices in both scenarios would have deteriorated in 2030 from 2011, as long the index for the
education wave is less than the other case, the result would come out as favorable towards reducing inequality.

Note:	Results	based	on	microsimulation	for	individual	countries.	The	re-weight	procedure	is	based	on	projected	population	
in	2030,	taking	into	account	changes	in	the	size	and	number	of	skilled	workers	by	age	cohort,	for	each	country	between	
2011	and	2030.		
	
4.3	Sensitivity	tests	

         The	 sensitivity	 of	 the	 results	 to	 important	 factors,	 such	 as	 alternative	 elasticity	 of	
substitution	between	labor	types	and	different	nesting	structure	between	labor	and	capital	was	
tested.	If	skilled	and	unskilled	workers	are	imperfect	substitutes,	an	increase	in	the	relative	supply	
of	skilled	workers,	without	offsetting	skill-biased	changes	in	demand	or	other	factors	in	supply,	
will	unavoidably	reduce	the	wage	premium	of	skill.		In	the	growth	literature,	one	way	to	account	
for	the	lack	of	effects	of	capital	accumulation	on	the	rental-wage	ratios	in	advanced	economies	is	
to	 introduce	 labor-augmenting	 productivity	 (due	 to	 having	 more	 capital	 goods	 available	 per	
worker.)		Another	way	is	to	raise	the	elasticity	of	substitution	between	the	factors	of	production	
as	suggested	by	de	la	Grandville	and	Solow	(2009).	Others,	like	Houthakker	(1955)	and	Jones	
(2005),	 distinguished	 between	 short-term	 and	 long-term	 production	 possibilities.	 In	 modern	
economic	 growth	 theory,	 Acemoglu	 (2009)	 emphasized	 the	 importance	 of	 directed	 or	 biased	
technological	change	and	the	endogenous	nature	of	technology	to	explain	that,	in	over	60	years	
since	 1939,	 the	 U.S	 relative	 supply	 of	 skills	 has	 increased	 rapidly,	 but	 there,	 college	 premium	
increased	over	the	period.31		

       In	the	sensitivity	tests	(table	6),	the	elasticity,	along	with	a	few	other	factors,	was	changed.	
When	 the	 elasticity	 of	 substitution	 between	 skilled	 labor	 and	 capital	 is	 raised	 (relative	 to	 the	
baseline),	the	mean	income	increases.	Raising	the	elasticity	just	between	skilled	labor	and	capital

                                                                                                                                                            29
means	that	capital	accumulation	would	tend	to	raise	demand	for	skilled	labor	in	the	same	nest.	
The	effect	would	tend	to	maintain	the	wage	premium	of	skill	(similar	to	the	effects	regarding	K	
and	 L	 in	 the	 growth	 literature).	 Inequality	 in	 all	 dimensions	 (global,	 regional,	 and	 country)	 is	
relatively	similar	to	the	education	wave	scenario.	The	findings	somewhat	mimic	the	effects	of	a	
biased	technological	change.	The	worst-case	scenario	for	inequality	under	education	wave	is	the	
alternative	nesting	structure	of	inputs	(ST-3).		Putting	skilled	and	unskilled	labor	in	the	same	nest	
has	the	same	effect	as	raising	the	elasticity	of	substitution	between	the	labor	types	against	capital.		
The	effect	would	more	directly	dampen	any	fall	in	premia	between	skilled	and	unskilled	workers.	
The	result	is	to	raise	global	inequality	between	and	within	country	in	all	the	measures	against	the	
baseline,	but	it	is	still	slightly	better	than	the	no-education	wave	scenario.

     5. Conclusion	
The	 sudden	 integration	 of	 China,	 India,	 and	 the	 former	 Soviet	 bloc	 of	 countries	 in	 the	 global	
economy	has	brought	about	the	‘great	doubling’	(Freeman	2007)	of	the	global	labor	markets	and	
triggered	significant	changes	in	the	global	income	distribution.	This	paper	analyzes,	in	an	ex-ante	
fashion,	what	is	the	impact	of	another	‘great	one-and-a-half	times’	shock	to	the	global	economy.	
Because	their	younger	(and	larger)	populations	and	the	still	large	positive	gap	in	education	of	their	
young	cohorts	vis-à-vis	their	old	ones,	developing	countries	will	soon	be	the	sole	contributors	to	
the	expansion	of	the	global	pool	of	skilled	workers.	Even	without	any	improvement	in	education	
effort	by	2030,	the	ratio	of	skilled	workers	from	developing	countries	to	skilled	workers	from	high	
income	(OECD)	countries	will	be	3	to	1,	up	from	2	to	1	in	2012;	a	‘one-and-a-half	times’	increase	
that	this	paper	labels	the	education	wave.	
The	main	result	from	the	analysis	of	the	impact	of	this	education	wave	is	that	global	inequality	will	

                                                                                                                                      30
likely	 decrease.	 This	 is	 driven	 by	 a	 reduction	 of	 inequality	 between	 and	 within	 countries.	
Convergence	 of	 incomes	 per	 capita	 between	 countries,	 mainly	 depending	 on	 closing	 up	 of	
productivity	 gaps	 between	 high	 income	 and	 developing	 countreis,	 is	 further	 boosted	 by	 the	
education	wave.	In	addition,	despite	its	increasingly	larger	weight	in	determing	global	inequality,	
within-country	 inequality	 would	 descrease	 in	 most	 countries.	 Education,	 especially	 for	 the	
developing	 world,	 can	 still	 play	 the	 role	 of	 the	 great	 equalizer.	 The	 results	 also	 show	 that	 the	
pressure	on	high	income	countries	may	still	be	on	in	the	future.
