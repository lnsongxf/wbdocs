Overview




Latin America and the Caribbean (henceforth referred to simply as Latin
America) does not have the infrastructure it needs or deserves given its income
level. Infrastructure also falls short of what is needed to advance social integration
and achieve higher growth and prosperity. Moreover, the region’s infrastructure
does not correspond to the aspirations of its growing middle class.
    Many argue that the solution is to spend more. With perhaps the exception
of Africa, Latin America does invest the least in infrastructure among develop-
ing regions as a share of gross domestic product (GDP)—less than 3 percent
compared with 4–7 percent elsewhere (table O.1). So the story might seem
simple: the region underperforms on infrastructure and has to spend more to
narrow its infrastructure “investment gap.”
    But that story would not match the facts.
    First, the region’s infrastructure performance varies, both across countries and
sectors. The region invests little in infrastructure on average, but this average is
driven by some of its largest countries: Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Many
others—Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru—invest more
than 4 percent of GDP a year. Transport and wastewater are real challenges, but the
region performs quite well in electricity and water. In fact, Latin America’s clean,
sophisticated electricity sector could become a serious competitive advantage.
    Second, the focus should be on the service gap, rather than on a notional, and
largely hypothetical, investment gap. To the question of, “How much is needed?”
the response should always be: “For what?” And the answer should lie with coun-
tries’ aspirations of economic growth and their social and environmental objec-
tives, as well as with their choices as to the relative roles of infrastructure and
other investments in achieving those aspirations.
    Third, the investment gap approach necessarily focuses attention on the ques-
tion of raising more resources. But closing the service gap should not—and,
indeed, cannot—be just about spending more. The service gap can be narrowed,
if not closed, in two other ways: by ensuring that spending (particularly of scarce
public resources) is well targeted and that it is efficient.
    This report has one main message: Latin America can dramatically narrow its
infrastructure service gap by spending efficiently on the right things. It remains

          Note: GDP = gross domestic product. No data was available for Eastern Europe. Applying these shares to
          2014 GDP figures suggests Latin America accounts for about $180 billion out of total developing country
          infrastructure spending of about $1.5 trillion.




     to be seen whether spending better will be sufficient for the region to fully
     achieve what it aspires to. But there is sufficient evidence that spending better
     and focusing scarce public resources on what matters would significantly narrow
     the service gap.
         The “spend better” message is also pragmatic. Most Latin American countries
     have limited fiscal space to increase public investments (total, not just
     infrastructure related); these have dropped to an average of about 3.4 percent of
     GDP across the region. Historically, only about a third of total public investment
     goes to infrastructure. So, at least in the short to medium term, it is highly
     unlikely that the region’s public investment in infrastructure could rise much
     above 1.0–1.5 percent of GDP.
         Could private investments be a way to close the service gap? Investments cap-
     tured through the World Bank’s private participation in infrastructure (PPI) data-
     base have ranged from 0.5 to 1.2 percent of GDP per year since 2006. But with
     about one-third of this financing coming from public sources, and about half of
     the deals requiring public guarantees, PPI expansion is constrained by limited
     public finance. In other words, while PPIs may help improve performance, they
     do not leverage significant amounts of private capital and are best seen as a
     complement to, rather than a substitute for, public investments.
         As to commercial borrowing by public utilities, it is limited by poor creditwor-
     thiness, at least in the water sector: only 20 percent of the Latin American water
     utilities included in the International Benchmarking Network for Water and
     Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) database (2016) generate enough of a surplus to
     mobilize commercial borrowing (assumed to be cash revenues exceeding costs by
     at least 20 percent). This means that 80 percent of Latin America’s water utilities
     would have difficulties in mobilizing commercial (nongovernment guaranteed)
     financing unless they implement significant reforms. Another way of looking at this
     is that greater efficiency could bring in much more financing (figure O.1).
         So, realistically, Latin America is unlikely to see infrastructure investments rise
     much above 2.7 percent of GDP if it relies only on public spending and PPIs.

As such, spending better on the right things (which includes improving the
creditworthiness of public utilities and the balance between user fees and
taxpayer financing of infrastructure) is not just the best way to make a
significant dent in the investment gap. For many countries it will be the
only way.
   Thus, this report advocates a much more careful discussion of investment
needs in Latin America, one that starts with a debate about what infrastructure
is needed given countries’ development priorities (which typically also includes
prudent fiscal policies), that thoroughly examines how to achieve infrastructure
goals efficiently (which requires looking at country, sector, and project cost driv-
ers), and that relies on well-thought-out rules of the game for deciding what
should be financed by taxpayers rather than users.
   As such, the key questions to ask are the following:

•	 What is the goal?
•	 How to achieve it as cost effectively as possible?
•	 Who pays?

   The first two questions will determine investment needs, while the third will
determine financing options. We address these three questions in what
follows—hoping to offer a useful framework for countries to devise infrastruc-
ture strategies.

     What Is the Goal? And How to Set It?
     Infrastructure (defined here as power, water, sanitation, transport, flood protec-
     tion, and the backbone of telecommunication) is necessary for growth, poverty
     alleviation, social inclusion, resilience, and environmental sustainability.
        But it is the service that matters more than the kilometers of roads or pipes
     and cables, along with quality and affordability. In fact, better or more infrastruc-
     ture is often only one of many ways to achieve a policy goal. Take transport as an
     example. If the objective is to improve mobility or access to services, it may be
     more effective to better regulate transport services or build more clinics and
     schools rather than roads and highways. And infrastructure needs change over
     time, as economies develop, societies urbanize, the middle class grows, the cli-
     mate changes, and technologies drive transformation on many fronts.
        Investment gap approaches seldom take these considerations into account.
     Instead, the methodologies behind the investment gap estimates do one of two
     things:

     •	 They examine how infrastructure access or stocks have evolved historically
        relative to income, urbanization, economic structure, and other factors, then
        estimate what it would take to maintain this relationship. If in the past this
        access or stock was suboptimal, the projected ones will be as well. Importantly,
        these estimates are in no way the result of an optimization exercise: they do
        not represent the level of investment that will maximize growth or poverty
        reduction, but just what is needed for business as usual to continue.
     •	 They price a goal (such as universal access to water or electricity) using either
        rough estimates of costs (such as average cost of a water connection) or, in
        best-case scenarios, an economic-engineering model (a least-cost optimization
        plan for the electricity network). This approach is useful where goals have
        been set (such as universal access to water or electricity) and can help inform
        policy debates by providing estimates of the costs of different goals (such as
        access to water or to safely managed water; in the house or within 100 meters
        of the dwelling) or different ways of achieving them. But it cannot substitute
        for policy choices regarding the service gap or public priorities—for example,
        in transport, where there is no simple “universal access” goal to aspire to.

        So, how to think about Latin America’s infrastructure goals? We suggest two
     sets of inputs that countries can factor in as they go about defining the infrastruc-
     ture needed to support their economic, social, and environmental objectives.
     Again, however, these are no more than inputs to help make the needed policy
     choices.

     Stocktaking along with Peer Comparison or Benchmarking—This Suggests
     That Latin America May Want to Focus on Sanitation and Transport
     In comparing Latin America to its peers, there are clear areas of strength and
     weakness. The region scores well in terms of access to water and electricity.

Some 94 percent of households have access to improved water. The 20 million
or so households that still lack access are concentrated in just six countries,
and all but one (Haiti) are comfortably middle income, suggesting that full
coverage is well within the region’s financial capacity. The story is similar for
electricity: 96 percent of households have access. Access rates are progressing
well, helped by supportive policies (again with the exception of Haiti). Water
and electricity utilities could do better, especially in terms of efficiency and
cost recovery, but there are many good performers.
    The electricity sector has the potential to turn into a great competitive advan-
tage for the region. It is the cleanest of any region, based mostly on hydroelectric-
ity. The increased uncertainty of water precipitation associated with climate
change means that the region will need to diversify its renewable resources. It has
significant potential in solar and wind, and while these remain just a sliver of
overall generation, investments are increasing rapidly—not surprising in light of
the high score given to the investment framework for renewables by World Bank
analysis.
    The policy framework for energy efficiency remains wanting, however, which
results in poor electricity efficiency. This is a priority area, along with improving
the regional connectivity of electricity systems. The region could potentially
leapfrog into the kind of systems now emerging in high-income countries, with
decentralized electricity production and consumers as “prosumers.” Doing so
would require a substantial evolution on the part of utilities, but the sophistica-
tion of the region’s markets and regulators makes it a distinct possibility.
    More challenging are sanitation and modern cooking fuels, both of which
have serious implications for public health and human capital accumulation.
Some 17 percent of Latin Americans have no access to a private, improved
sanitation facility, and only about a third of wastewater is treated. The dismal
wastewater performance is a real emergency, and one that epitomizes the
potential for spending better. The sector is hampered by overly ambitious
“imported” regulations that are unrealistic and leave no room for gradual
improvement. Worse, legislation usually precludes resource recovery even
though wastewater plants can be designed to generate electricity for their own
use or sale, and gray water and treated sludge can be used for agriculture and
other purposes. A case in point is Lima, a city of nearly 8.5 million in the
middle of a desert, that discharges its used water into the ocean and disposes
of its sludge in expensive sanitary landfills instead of allowing it to be used for
agriculture.
    As for modern cooking fuels, some 87 million people still lack access.
This issue has not received sufficient attention or financial support. More than
half the people of Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua still use solid fuel for
cooking, which results in serious public health implications. Even in relatively
wealthy Mexico, the share is still 13 percent.
    But the transport sector is where Latin America most underperforms its peers.
This is partly due to the region’s low population density, which makes it
extremely hard to affordably develop a dense transport network. Latin America’s

     paved road density is similar to that of Africa (as is the perception of its road
     quality, according to the World Economic Forum’s rankings). This may be a nor-
     mal consequence of the region’s geography and need not imply that its countries
     need more roads. The region does have a very high road occupancy rate, however,
     as well as large pockets of inaccessibility.
        Physical infrastructure is only part of the transportation challenge. A lack of
     competition in trucking and inefficient customs clearance processes are largely
     responsible for relatively low logistics performance. The road transport industry
     is some 15 times more concentrated than in the United States. In Central
     America, increased competition on national routes could reduce prices by
     8 cents per ton-km as opposed to only 3 cents for tackling inefficiencies such as
     high congestion, long waits at borders, and bribery. The region has limited inte-
     gration among different transport modes, especially rail and road. Ports suffer
     from highly congested access roads. In urban transport, a number of cities have
     modern, well-functioning bus rapid transit systems, but most struggle with high
     congestion, pockets of inaccessibility, inefficient and often inequitable pricing,
     and continuing reliance on informal public transport providers.

     Emerging Needs and Challenges: Climate Change, Increased Demand, and
     Urbanization
     Infrastructure is typically long lived and influences households and firms’ own
     investments and locational choices—choices that are difficult to reverse, creating
     lock-ins. As such, infrastructure decisions need to be forward looking. Two trends
     that matter for the region’s infrastructure choices are climate change and the
     combination of urbanization and changing socioeconomics.
         Climate change means that energy, transport, and water and sanitation sys-
     tems will need to be built differently to become more resilient to extreme events
     and better able to respond to associated changes in demand: more electricity
     during heat waves, better water storage to cope with both droughts and extreme
     rains, and protective dams and improved drainage to reduce flood risk.
         Climate change will also increase the need for better resource management—it
     is another factor that creates pressure for greater efficiency, especially for water
     and energy. Mexico, and to a lesser extent Brazil and Colombia, have policies in
     place to boost energy efficiency. But implementation has been weak and has
     occurred mostly in the context of domestic energy crises. Further, fossil fuel sub-
     sidies remain high in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and
     República Bolivariana de Venezuela. In general, the region has significant poten-
     tial for improving energy efficiency.
         Climate change also means that pressures will mount to reduce emissions
     from infrastructure. As mentioned above, this could become a source of com-
     parative advantage for Latin America, which has the cleanest electricity matrix
     in the world. But increasingly variable precipitation and strong popular pushback
     against dams are making it increasingly urgent for the region to diversify its
     renewable energy sources. Transport emissions are growing rapidly, and without
     action, emissions from infrastructure-related sectors are likely to increase further.

Overview	                                                                                7


A business-as-usual scenario, with increased motorization and decreased reliance
on hydroelectricity, would see energy-related emissions more than double across
the region between 2010 and 2050.
   Changing socioeconomics are also affecting the demand for infrastructure
services. The region’s middle class grew by about 50 percent during the boom
years of 2003–09. The vast majority of the middle class has access to basic ser-
vices but is far from saturated in terms of consumer durables (notably cars, air
conditioners, and washing machines). The combination of higher incomes with a
recent boom in consumer credit could significantly raise overall energy demand,
in a way that may not be sufficiently taken into account in traditional energy
forecasts. At the same time, most remaining challenges in basic access to water
and electricity are now concentrated among the poorest decile, which may be the
social group most difficult to reach, either because of remoteness or depth of
poverty. The last-mile challenge may well be more complex than previous ones
and require innovation in technology, delivery, and financing.
   Linked with changing socioeconomics is the region’s ongoing but changing
urbanization. Density has declined in Brasilia, Buenos Aires, La Paz, Montevideo,
and Santiago, driven by transport, land use, and housing policies. If expansion
patterns continue unchanged, built-up urban areas could double in the region by
2035, pushing up infrastructure costs. A recent World Bank review of urbaniza-
tion in Mexico suggests that denser urbanization would reduce infrastructure
investments and maintenance costs by 41 percent in Merida and 67 percent in
Los Cabos.
   Another critical question is whether the region can improve how urbanization
is planned and managed. Unplanned urban expansion translates into higher
costs as slum upgrading costs two to eight times more than regular land devel-
opment. Already some 25 percent of the region’s urban dwellers live in slums,
and they account for a large claim on the region’s infrastructure investment
budget.


How to Improve Services as Cost-Effectively as Possible?
Spending better could materially reduce the cost of improving infrastructure in
Latin America. Take the case of electricity: availability can be increased by build-
ing more power plants or by improving energy efficiency. And despite having a
rather sophisticated and mature electricity market, the region still fares poorly on
energy efficiency. In fact, transmission and distribution losses are some of the high-
est in the world. Not surprisingly, background work done for this report finds that
electricity investment needs would average US$23 billion to US$24 billion a year
if South America follows the same investment path it has in the past, but perhaps
as little as US$8 billion to US$9 billion if it adopts a transformational approach
that favors demand-side management, energy efficiency, and renewable energy
solutions. (This number only includes investments and not the cost of demand-
side management and energy efficiency programs. The total would be higher, but
still likely to be substantially less than under a traditional path.)

         Similarly, for water, the World Bank estimates that the Sustainable Development
     Goal of universal access to safely managed water and sanitation would cost
     between 0.1 and 0.4 percent of GDP a year through 2030, depending on how it
     is implemented. A reasonable way forward would cost about 0.25 percent of
     GDP—roughly what the region has been investing in recent years, with good
     results on water but less so on sanitation.
         A simple framework is useful to think through the various elements of reform
     needed to improve infrastructure spending efficiency. The ultimate objective is
     to deliver infrastructure services to households and firms in a way that maximizes
     some measure of welfare. Hence it will depend

     •	 on the supply side, on the cost of producing such services, from the initial con-
        struction of supporting networks to the end delivery of services to users, and
     •	 on the demand side, on the availability and affordability of services, given the
        quality produced and the pricing schemes for users.

        On the supply side, key whole-of-government challenges have been identified
     as particularly problematic for public investment management. These include
     the following:

     •	 Weak planning, project appraisal, and preparation capacity. Work by the World
        Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund
        shows that Latin America has a low level of investment efficiency, with the
        weakest stages of public investment management being appraisal and evalua-
        tion. Many projects are funded that are not sufficiently prepared—either
        because of limited capacity or oversight, or because of parliamentary amend-
        ments to annual budget laws. This is a serious issue in Brazil in particular,
        where a combination of weak capacity, lax enforcement, and pork-barrel
        politics results in investment projects being included in ministerial budgets
        ­
        without having been subject to formal appraisal.

     •	 Overly rigid or myopic budgeting. This is designed to manage fiscal deficits and
        focuses on controlling cash expenditures rather than promoting efficient
        spending. As a result, most countries have annual budgets that do not allow for
        carryover. This results in rushed procurement and execution and is further
        complicated by the fact that the fiscal year runs from January to December,
        when the right time for public works in most countries is the dry season of
        November to March. Colombia appears to be one of the few countries in the
        region that has a strong planning system and that has introduced medium-
        term expenditures frameworks. Other countries have created fiduciary funds
        to avoid this budget rigidity, choose public-private partnerships (PPPs), or con-
        tinue to cope with multiannual allocations.

     •	 Difficulties with budget execution. This is a particular issue in Brazil, where dis-
        bursement data show a chronic gap between committed and executed funds
        (figure O.2).

•	 Procurement that could be improved. Inefficient procurement processes contrib-
   ute to limited budget execution and excess costs. Some countries in the region
   such as Chile and Mexico have seen remarkable success in driving procure-
   ment reforms. For example, the ChileCompra electronic portal is estimated to
   have generated US$280 million in savings. Mexico’s modernization of its ten-
   dering processes generated savings of more than US$1 billion within three
   years of its 2009 start. But a detailed analysis of procurement performance
   across the region shows that there is considerable room for improvement.
   The World Bank’s Benchmarking Public Procurement 2017 report found that
   suppliers identify obstacles such as excessive bureaucracy and red tape in
   Colombia and Honduras; payment delays in Argentina, the Dominican
   Republic, and Jamaica; lack of transparency and opaque tendering processes in
   Brazil and Mexico; and inefficiency in Barbados.

•	 Unclear project sustainability. This can be caused by an imbalance between
   capital and current spending on infrastructure. This can spring from overly
   rigid budgets and suboptimal planning—very few countries in the region
   link investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates—or from poor
   coordination between central governments (which fund and often manage
   capital investments) and local governments (which may lack the financial
   and technical capacity to take over these investments or cover operation
   and maintenance costs).

•	 An uncompetitive construction industry. Competition policy, to the extent that
   it affects competition in construction and related activities, is likely to have an
   important impact on construction costs.

         Next comes a postconstruction stage that relates to operational efficiency in
      service delivery and depends on the ownership structure, the quality of the
      regulatory framework, and corporate governance. A review of utility perfor-
      mance in the region found that, on average, private utilities outperform public
      ones, although there are good and bad performers in both groups (the top
      10 percent of public utilities outperform the average private utility).
      Independent regulatory agencies that are transparent, accountable, and free of
      political interference are critical to improving the performance of both public
      and private operators—helping raise labor productivity and cost-recovery ratios
      while reducing operational expenses and distribution losses. For state-owned
      enterprises, performance further depends on the existence of a corporate struc-
      ture that prevents political intervention, rewards performance, and is subject to
      public scrutiny. Best-practice corporatized frameworks—which include an
      independent performance-driven board of directors, a professional staff, trans-
      parency and clear disclosure policies, and a clear mechanism for evaluating
      performance—are associated with high levels of performance, with perfor-
      mance orientation and professional management being the most important
      contributors.
         Similarly, for transport (the one nonutility sector we examine), substantial
      efficiency gains are likely to come from regulatory frameworks that encour-
      age both greater intermodal coordination and more competition in the
      industries related to transport services. The latter may allow for substantial
      gains to be redirected from profits in these industries to consumers of infra-
      structure. For example, monopolistic freight transport services may well end
      up capturing most of the potential rent created by additional physical infra-
      structure, reducing demand and potentially nullifying the gain from the
      investments.
         Finally, on the demand side, a number of price-related aspects are key to driv-
      ing efficiency. The first is simply adequate pricing, which encourages efficient use
      by consumers (to buy more fuel-efficient cars, use public transportation, turn off
      lights, buy energy-efficient appliances, fix leaking faucets, and so on). Pricing
      services appropriately also makes it possible to attract commercial financing,
      which in turn may create additional pressures for efficiency.
         But adequate pricing is not simply cost-recovery tariffs. It needs to factor in
      social acceptability—which requires that price regulation go hand in hand with
      regulation of quality and with considerations of availability and affordability.
      This last point is where equity concerns and issues of externalities should be
      included, to ensure that policy makers consider the added social value of services
      (for example, in water, sanitation, or public transport) when defining what
      should be funded by taxpayers rather than users.
         But while pricing is important, other mechanisms (incentives, information,
      and nudges such as options that default to more efficient settings, quotas, or
      performance standards) are available to push consumers to switch to more effi-
      cient patterns of consumption and appliances. These can be helpful comple-
      ments, especially where price elasticities are low.

Who Should Pay—And What Does It Imply in Terms of
Financing Options?

Spending efficiently on the right things also means making judicious use of scarce
public resources. Infrastructure is funded by either taxpayers or users. Taxpayer
money is best used where it is not possible to charge the users (as with flood
protection or rural roads) or not desirable to do so (because of environmental and
social externalities that result in underconsumption of the service, as with water
treatment or public transportation, or due to equity concerns as in subsidies tar-
geting the poor).
   But the potential for cost recovery cannot be divorced from the efficiency with
which a service is provided. Poor quality service will reduce willingness to pay,
while high costs will reduce the likelihood of achieving full cost recovery, espe-
cially if there is a perception of inefficiency or predatory pricing on the part of the
service provider. And even where subsidies may be justified by externalities, as
with wastewater treatment for example, it may be possible to reduce the needed
subsidies by reducing costs. Most countries find it difficult to achieve full cost
recovery for wastewater treatment plants using traditional business models, under
which a water treatment plant is a cost center. Instead, new models are being pro-
posed whereby water treatment plants can generate electricity for self-consumption
and even sale to the network and can sell sanitized sludge for use as a fertilizer.
   Charging users, where possible and appropriate, has a number of advantages.
First, it helps manage demand. Second, it creates a market test and puts pressure
on the service provider (public or private) to improve quality. Indeed, there is
some evidence that the efficiency gains typically associated with PPI are depen-
dent on such a market test. (This raises some concerns, given that only about
43 percent of the region’s PPPs are backed by user fees or a purchasing agree-
ment with fully private utilities.) Third, charging users directly increases the
revenue base for investments and creates the potential for commercial financing,
regardless of who operates or owns the infrastructure. And commercial financing
in turn is likely to create pressure for greater efficiency.
   In this context, the World Bank Group, along with other multilateral develop-
ment banks, is suggesting an approach that weighs the benefits and opportunity
costs of deploying public and/or concessional resources (figure O.3). The starting
point of this approach is that any investment project or program that can be
financed on commercial terms while remaining affordable and offering value for
money, should be.
   Where commercial financing is not cost effective or viable due to perceived
risks or market failures, efforts should focus on addressing these market failures
through upstream reforms to strengthen country and sector policies, regulations,
and institutions or with targeted public interventions (for example, targeted sub-
sidies or complementary public investments, such as transmission lines). Where
risks remain high and raise the cost of commercial capital beyond that afforded
by project or corporate revenue generation, it may be possible to reduce costs
through risk-sharing instruments backed by public or concessional finance.

                   Only where commercial financing is still not viable or cost effective should pub-
                   lic and concessional resources be deployed.
                       Importantly, this framework can only be applied to services that can be
                   charged to users, as user fees are what creates the basis for commercial financing
                   options beyond the use of general taxes.1
                       Equity and poverty concerns are not at odds with reliance on commercial
                   financing, even though they are often invoked in arguments against full cost
                   recovery for basic services such as water and sanitation, electricity, public trans-
                   port, and modern cooking fuels. The needs of the poor are in fact typically best
                   served by a combination of cost-recovery tariffs and targeted subsidies and pay-
                   ments schemes adapted to their needs. Most of the wealthier Latin American
                   countries have well-developed social registries and safety nets (for example,
                   Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico), but targeting is likely to be a challenge for
                   countries without these in place.


                   Conclusions
                   Latin America spends a good deal of money on infrastructure. In return, it gets
                   the following:

                   •	 High electricity access—with good prospects for closing the access gap given
                      that the remaining unconnected households are concentrated in mostly mid-
                      dle-income countries—but low nonsolid fuel access, with serious health
                      implications

                                                                   Rethinking Infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean

•	 The world’s cleanest electricity—mostly from hydroelectricity, which is chal-
   lenged by increasingly frequent droughts—and small but rapidly growing wind
   and solar sectors
•	 Some world-class utilities for both water and electricity, and a few countries
   with sophisticated, stable, and predictable regulations, especially for electricity.
   But most utilities and regulatory schemes could do better, with potentially
   significant cost and resource savings
•	 Relatively high water access, though quality and safety remain poor, with sew-
   erage access low and less than 30 percent of wastewater being treated—an
   unacceptable level for a region with its levels of income and urbanization
•	 Mediocre transport services because of poor infrastructure and an uncompeti-
   tive transport industry, resulting in costly freight transport, congested cities,
   and deep pockets of rural isolation

   Improving the region’s infrastructure performance in a context of tight
fiscal space will require spending better on well-identified priorities. Unlike
most infrastructure diagnostics, this report insists that much of what is
needed lies outside the infrastructure sector and has to do with broader
government issues—from competition policy to budgeting rules that no lon-
ger solely focus on controlling cash expenditures. But quite a lot also involves
sector reforms, with the traditional recommendations regarding indepen-
dent, well-performing regulators and better corporate governance continu-
ing to apply. We also insist on the critical importance of cost recovery where
feasible and desirable, since user fees are the basis for commercial finance—
while keeping in mind the importance of reducing costs, either through
efficiency or adoption of alternative business models, such as those emerging
for water treatment plants.
   Latin America has long been an innovator in infrastructure. The report notes
many challenges, but it also highlights many examples of the region’s capacity for
innovative solutions, its expertise with sophisticated regulations, and its experi-
ence with PPPs. Latin America has the means and potential to do better. And it
can do so by spending more efficiently on the right things.

Infrastructure in Latin America and
the Caribbean: Modest Spending,
Uneven Results




Infrastructure serves a number of purposes. It provides the underlying
conditions for increased development, be it by providing more efficient trans-
port, the last-mile water supply for the poor, or energy for all. It can serve to
reduce inequalities (by serving slum dwellers rather than favoring better off
residents of cities), it can open access to markets to increase prosperity (trans-
port infrastructure), and it is recognized as a core input into any sustainable
growth strategy.
   So what should Latin America and the Caribbean be spending on
infrastructure?1 Estimates vary widely—from 3 to 8 percent of regional gross
domestic product (GDP)—though they tend to hover around 4 to 5 percent.
Most of these estimates use a simplistic methodology that measures only how
infrastructure spending would need to evolve as it has historically, along with
economic growth (box 1.1). They do not indicate what Latin America should
be spending to maximize growth (though some studies look at the cost of
achieving a specific social, economic, or environmental goal). Such estimates
are the results of benchmarking exercises, not optimization exercises.
   Yet there is widespread agreement in policy circles and in the news media that
Latin America needs to spend more on infrastructure. This belief comes from
general dissatisfaction with infrastructure services in the region and the widely
held idea that increased spending on infrastructure is key to improving the
region’s growth and competitiveness.
   But would increased spending solve Latin America’s infrastructure challenges?
To start answering that question, this section examines how much Latin America
currently spends on infrastructure—from both public and private sources—and
what it gets for its money.
   What we find, on average, is modest spending and uneven results across sec-
tors and countries. The region has made impressive progress in some areas, such
as extending access to water and developing modern public transport systems in

      Box 1.1  How Should Latin America Define Its Needs for Infrastructure Investment?
      Fay (2001) and Fay and Yepes (2003) provided the first estimates of infrastructure investment
      needs in developing regions. Their approach was essentially a benchmarking one, using
      simple econometrics to examine how infrastructure spending has evolved over time along
      with income, population, urbanization, gross domestic product (GDP) composition, and
      other relevant determinants of household and firm demand for infrastructure services.
      It then priced the investment needed to keep pace with increases in income, population, and
      urbanization.
          The main limitation of this approach is that there is no optimization. It simply prices what it
      would take to maintain the historically observed (possibly constrained) relation between infra-
      structure and income, population, and urbanization. The approach does not establish a causal
      relationship between investments and growth, nor does it price a specific desired objective
      (such as the Millennium or Sustainable Development Goals). It is also very sensitive to assump-
      tions about future growth rates.
          Subsequent authors (Kohli and Basil 2011; Perrotti and Sánchez 2011; Ruiz-Nuñez and Wei
      2015) have introduced various improvements and updates to this original model, with esti-
      mates for Latin America ranging from 3.6 to 6.0 percent of the region’s GDP (table B1.1.1).
      To our knowledge, however, no one has been able to answer the question of optimality (the
      amount of investment needed to achieve a particular growth path). CAF (2011), Powell (2013),
      and Serebrisky and others (2015) mostly draw from this body of work to conclude that the
      region’s infrastructure investment needs are 4–6 percent of GDP.
          Climate change considerations have also affected estimates and methodologies.
      Bhattacharya, Romani, and Stern (2012) estimate that Latin America would need an additional
      US$200 billion to US$300 billion a year to achieve mitigation and resilience objectives. But
      whereas reasonable methodologies exist to estimate the cost of low-carbon investment path-
      ways, estimating adaptation investment needs at the level of a country—let alone a region—is
      pure guesswork.

many large cities. Some water and energy utilities are world class. But too many
Latin Americans still suffer from poor or nonexistent services. The region is far
from having the infrastructure it needs to compete internationally and provide
the middle-class standard of living that many of its people aspire to and that a
mostly upper-middle-income region should be able to deliver.


How Much Does Latin America Spend on Infrastructure?
During 2008–13 (the most recent years for which data are available), average
annual investment in infrastructure in Latin American ranged from 2.4 to 3.2 percent
of GDP, for an average of 2.7 percent (figure 1.1). This is far from the upper-bound
“needs” estimates of 8 percent, or even from the 4–5 percent average suggested in
table B1.1.1, but in line with the lower-bound estimate of 3 percent.
   This regional average masks large differences across countries, from 1.6 percent
of GDP in Mexico to 6 percent in Nicaragua (figure 1.2). Indeed, the average is
largely determined by Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, which together account for
four-fifths of the region’s GDP.2 Many other countries—such as Bolivia, Costa
Rica, Panama, and Peru—invested more than 4 percent. No pattern emerges
about country size or income level. For example, smaller, poorer Central American
countries are evenly split between those that invested a little (El Salvador,
Guatemala) and those that invested a lot (Honduras, Nicaragua).
   Public-private partnerships (PPPs) accounted for some 40 percent of the
region’s infrastructure investments—though with significant variation, from

      4 percent in Bolivia to 58 percent in Honduras, again with no clear pattern on
      the basis of country size or income. (A note of caution is in order in interpreting
      these numbers as these are commitments rather than actual investments.
      Moreover, they are recorded in full the year a deal is signed, rather than spread
      over time as the investments take place.) The top four destinations in terms of
      share of GDP include some of the region’s largest and richest countries (Brazil,
      Peru) and some of its smallest and poorest (Honduras, Nicaragua).
         During the first half of this decade, PPP volumes in Latin America gyrated
      wildly, mostly because of fluctuating investments in Brazil (figure 1.3). Elsewhere
      in the region, PPPs have grown steadily, from around 0.2 percent of GDP to
      0.8 percent. Over the past 10 years, most PPPs in Latin America have been
      greenfield investments, mainly in the energy sector.
         But even if the private sector participates in a project, it does not necessarily
      directly invest its own money (equity) in the project. Indeed, during 2011–15,
      equity accounted for less than a third of PPP finance in Latin America
      (figure 1.4). Loans have almost always been the most common instrument used
      to finance infrastructure projects in Latin America—primarily from commer-
      cial banks, but about a third from public sources such as development banks,
      state and national banks, export credit agencies, and other public authorities
      and companies.3 Bonds remain a small share (12 percent on average over the
      past five years) even though the region leads emerging economies in the use of
      bonds for infrastructure financing.

      More generally, direct and indirect government support plays a critical role
   in facilitating private investment in infrastructure.4 From 2010 to 2014, about
   half of all PPP deals in Latin America received some form of government
   support through direct or indirect contributions, with payment guarantees
   being the most common type of support. The energy sector got the highest

      share of guarantees, while transport received the highest share of direct gov-
      ernment support.
          Government support typically declines with the maturity of the PPP market,
      but it does not disappear: in 2000–14, nearly 75 percent of PPPs in countries
      with limited experience with such projects received guarantees, compared with
      45 percent of PPPs in countries with stronger track records. These direct and
      indirect guarantees create contingent liabilities for the public sector even if there
      is still debate on how they should be accounted for in public accounts.


      What Is the Region Getting for Its Money?
      Latin America spends a fair bit of money on infrastructure. In exchange, it gets
      the following:

      •	 Mediocre transport services owing to low-quality infrastructure and an uncom-
         petitive transport industry resulting in costly freight transport, congested cities,
         and deep pockets of rural isolation
      •	 Relatively high water access, though quality and safety remain poor given that
         sewerage coverage is low and less than 30 percent of wastewater is treated—an
         unacceptable level for a region with its levels of income and urbanization
      •	 High electricity access, with the remaining unconnected areas concentrated in
         a few countries (rich and poor) and good prospects for closing the access gap,
         but low access to nonsolid fuel—with serious health implications
      •	 The world’s cleanest electricity, mostly from hydroelectricity (though threat-
         ened by increasingly frequent droughts), and small but rapidly growing solar
         and wind sectors
      •	 Some world-class utilities for both water and electricity and a few countries
         with sophisticated, stable, and predictable regulations, especially for electricity
         (But most utilities and countries could do better, potentially with significant
         cost and resource savings.)

      Transport: Unimpressive Outcomes, but Infrastructure Is Just Part of the
      Challenge
      Good transport services are a major challenge for Latin America for several
      reasons. First, the region’s overall population density is low, making it difficult to
      design a dense, affordable network. Second, the region’s economy is dependent
      on trade—the recent boom was driven by commodity exports—making its com-
      petitiveness highly sensitive to the performance of its transport sector. Third, the
      region’s high urbanization and relatively high income call for fairly sophisticated
      urban transport systems.
         Rising awareness of the implications of poor transport infrastructure likely
      explains the substantial increase in transport investments between 2002 and
      2013. These started to pick up in 2004 and grew significantly through 2009, hov-
      ering around 1.00–1.25 percent of GDP since 2007, more than other infrastruc-

countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) spent around 1 ­  percent of GDP during
2008–13, while others (Bolivia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru) spent two to three times
as much. Public investments dominated the period, though a recent increase in
private investment helped offset a drop in public spending (figure 1.5, panel b).

Weak Infrastructure and an Uncompetitive Industry Result in Poor
Performance
Despite increased investment, transport performance remains poor. Latin America
has low transport infrastructure density given its income level, with paved road
density similar to Africa’s and about one-quarter that of the next lowest region
(table 1.1). This may, however, be a normal consequence of the region’s geogra-
phy and need not necessarily imply that the region needs more roads.
Nevertheless, Latin America’s roadway occupancy rate is higher than that of any
other region (figure 1.6), and the region is characterized by a combination of
large pockets of inaccessibility and congestion challenges, particularly in large
cities. For rail infrastructure, density is less than 5 kilometers per thousand square
kilometers for countries with a rail network compared with 16 kilometers per
thousand square kilometers for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries. More relevant is the fact that service is limited
and not an effective substitute for, or even complement to, road transport. Only
Brazil and Mexico carry more than 20 percent of freight by rail (CAF 2013).
    Moreover, the region’s infrastructure is perceived as being of rather low
quality. Road, rail, port, and air infrastructure improved steadily in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia over the past 10 years, but in Latin America, roads and
ports improved only marginally, and railroads and airports did not improve at all
(figure 1.7). In 2016, international investors ranked the region’s road infrastruc-
ture at the same level as that of Sub-Saharan Africa. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,

                                        economies, have fallen behind (see figure 1.7, panel d). Passenger demand has
                                        risen in recent years, powered by the continued emergence of a Latin American
                                        middle class—a trend expected to continue. In freight, Latin America/Europe
                                        and Latin America/North America routes have been growing steadily and are
                                        expected to continue to grow by about 5 percent a year over the next decade
                                        (Crabtree and others 2015). Turnaround costs for planes rose 34 percent in real
                                        terms over the period 1995–2009, more than in most North American and
                                        European airports (Serebrisky 2011).
                                           Ports appear to have improved somewhat over the past decade—as measured

impressions—but by less than the region’s peers (figure 1.7, panel b). A particu-
lar challenge for ports is access infrastructure: surface infrastructure such as
access roads would need to increase by some 15 percent within 50 kilometers of
ports and key transport centers by 2030 given current and predicted trade vol-
umes (ITF 2016).
   The effects of generally poor infrastructure are compounded by an uncom-
petitive road transport industry that is some 15 times more concentrated than

                                  that of the United States (OECD and ECLAC 2012). Data for Argentina, Brazil,
                                  Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Paraguay suggest
                                  that 44 percent of road hauls in these countries are made without fee-earning
                                  return journeys—a sure way to increase costs and congestion (IDB 2015).
                                  In Central America, improved cost efficiencies—offsetting or reducing the effects
                                  of congestion, long wait times at borders, and high informal payments—could cut
                                  costs by 3 cents per ton-kilometer. But simply having more competition on
                                  national routes would cut prices by 8 cents per ton-kilometer. For the region as
                                  a whole, allowing foreign companies to serve national routes rather than limiting
                                  them to international point-to-point trips could help bring freight costs in line
                                  with its peers (Osborne, Pachón, and Araya 2014).
                                     Latin America ranks poorly on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index
                                  (LPI), closer to Sub-Saharan Africa than to East Asia (figure 1.8). Disaggregating
                                  the region’s overall LPI shows that this lackluster performance is due to ineffi-
                                  cient customs clearance processes and shoddy trade and transport infrastructure.
                                  Country disparities are pronounced. Chile was the region’s best performer

But Bolivia, Guatemala, Jamaica, and República Bolivariana de Venezuela were
at or below the Sub-Saharan average.
   The World Bank’s Doing Business data offer a more positive diagnostic, show-
ing Latin America to have higher costs and longer times to export than East Asia
(and higher costs than South Asia), but lower costs and shorter times than other
developing regions (table 1.2).

Rural Areas Are Challenged by Low Transport and Population Densities
Connecting rural communities to the “outside world” is essential for inclusive
development. Good rural access can raise household welfare, asset ownership,
agricultural productivity, and access to basic services. In Peru, a survey of
176 rural districts in the poorest and previously isolated areas in Andean prov-
inces found that improved rural accessibility significantly increased agricultural
wages, as well as land and housing prices, and boosted the frequency of health
consultations by 70 percent (World Bank 2015).
   The low density of both populations and transport infrastructure in Latin
America makes it a challenge to increase rural accessibility. Further, data on rural
connectivity are scarce, with few countries having geo-referenced datasets on
roads that would enable the calculation of some type of rural accessibility mea-
sure (let alone some kind of rural investment optimization). A rural accessibility
index estimating the share of the rural population living within 2 kilometers of
an all-weather road is available for only a handful of countries in Central and
South America. The index indicates that poor rural access to roads is concen-
trated in the Amazonian basin. But there are noticeable pockets of poor access in
coastal regions of Colombia and Ecuador, and access is mixed in Honduras and
Nicaragua as well (map 1.1). The need for rural access should be balanced with
environmental protection, given the well-documented impact of roads on defor-
estation (Ali and others 2015).5

                             Urban Areas Suffer from Congestion and Lack of Accessibility despite the
                             Expansion of Rapid Bus Systems
                             Urban areas, where 80 percent of Latin Americans live, have seen a sharp
                             increase in the demand for and complexity of urban mobility. This is due to both
                             population and income increases. Over the past 10 or so years, the number of
                             people living in cities with more than 300,000 people—and so in need of reason-
                             ably sophisticated transport systems—grew by 28 percent (75 million). At the
                             same time, income growth and a rapid expansion of the middle class have caused
                             the number of cars and motorcycles to increase rapidly (figure 1.9): for example,
                             from about 6 million or 7 million cars and motorcycles in 1990 in Brazil and
                             Mexico to some 21 million or 22 million by 2010.
                                Rapid urbanization and increasing motorization have proven difficult for
                             policy makers to manage. Congestion is common in many urban areas, resulting
                             in frequent complaints about time lost in traffic. Unfortunately, limited data
                             are available on how Latin American cities fare relative to others—data cover-
                             age only includes large Brazilian cities and Mexico City. They suggest that
                             while congestion in the region results in long travel times for cars, it is not
                             systematically worse than in cities elsewhere of similar size (figure 1.10). That
                             said, striking differences between cities of similar size in the region (such as
                             Mexico City and São Paulo) suggest that policy makers have the power to
                             effect change.

28	                  Infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean: Modest Spending, Uneven Results


         The past decade has seen significant investments in large-scale public trans-
      port systems in key Latin American cities where population densities justify the
      investments. Many urban centers now have multiple public transport modes. Bus
      rapid transit (BRT) systems have grown rapidly in the region and now serve more
      than 20 million passengers a day. Among Latin American cities with more than
      1 million inhabitants, 59 percent have BRT systems, 31 percent have urban rail
      systems, and 25 percent have both.6
         Some BRTs have become victims of their own success, as there is a limit on
      the number of passengers they can serve each day. When ridership approaches
      700,000–800,000 passengers a day, urban transport systems have to consider
      diversifying—especially if urban planning or physical geography do not allow
      BRT systems to expand. That was the case in Quito, Ecuador, which is now plan-
      ning its first underground rail mass transit system. Metro systems and subways
      have become increasingly viable modes of transport in large cities with high
      population densities. Where urban rail systems are already in place, the density
      of service per resident remains low in most countries. Except for Santiago, Chile,
      Latin American cities have substantially less urban rail infrastructure than their
      counterparts in OECD countries.
         Non–mass transit systems remain poor, also challenged by the region’s rapid
      urbanization. City blocks are often infilled, leaving no space for pavement.
      This creates problems for pedestrians, who might be forced to walk in traffic,
      making walking dangerous during the day and almost impossible at night. And
      where pavement exists, it is often poorly maintained. Nonmotorized transport is
      seldom well-integrated with public transportation and is too often considered a
      peripheral issue rather than a key mode of transport.
         As part of efforts to reduce inequality, high-quality pavements and cycle lanes
      are extremely cost effective because poor people make heavy use of these invest-
      ments. They are also essential in providing last-mile transportation for citizens
      who need to reach mass transit such as BRTs and urban rail systems quickly and
      safely. Inadequate infrastructure for nonmotorized transport (such as sidewalks
      and dedicated bike lanes) and drivers’ noncompliance with traffic laws expose
      users to traffic accidents, thefts, and assaults. Most victims in traffic accidents are
      pedestrians and cyclists, many of whom belong to lower-income groups.
      In addition, pedestrians and cyclists are heavily exposed to pollution.
      Encouragingly, though the stock is still low, the number of bicycle lanes has
      exploded in recent years (figure 1.11).
         The quality of urban transport remains mixed across Latin America. Some
      newer public transport systems are of high quality. BRT users across all Latin
      America cities rate their service a respectable 3.5 out of 5 (BRTdata.org). The
      cost of an average mass transit journey varies substantially across the region, with
      the average fare in São Paulo and Curitiba five times that in Quito and Guayaquil
      (figure 1.12). Whether this is due to longer transit, higher costs, or greater cost
      recovery in the tariffs is unclear.

      Box 1.2  Using a Fare Affordability Index to Guide a Subsidy Program in
      Buenos Aires
      While the scale and scope of a subsidy program are political decisions based on a city’s finances
      and other goals, certain tools can help inform choices on who should receive funding and how
      much they should receive. An example is a fare affordability index to measure the financial
      impact of a standard basket of transit trips—say, 45 a month for each household member—on
      various income groups. Figure B1.2.1 shows this approach for Buenos Aires, where the afford-
      ability of public transport was measured for an average household as well as for families in the
      lowest income quintile.
          Affordability depends on the alternatives (say, walking and cycling) and other costs of liv-
      ing, including housing. Still, the fare affordability index can help policy makers as they think
      about different subsidy levels. In Buenos Aires, the index helped show that fares could be
      raised considerably and still be more affordable—as measured by the share of income the
      poorest quintile spent on a basket of travel—than a decade earlier.

    Without targeted demand-side subsidies, public transport can be unaffordable
for low-income groups. Household surveys from Bogota, Buenos Aires, Santo
Domingo, and São Paulo found that commuting on the formal public transport
system could eat up 20–30 percent of poor households’ budgets (Cubas and
­
others 2015). And although there is not an accepted ceiling for what house-
holds should spend on transport, a fare affordability index can help guide policy
decisions on existing or potential subsidies (box 1.2).
    Latin American countries have struggled to devise affordable, effective
subsidies for public transport. One common approach is to set fares for cost
recovery but offer targeted demand-side subsidies for specific population groups
(Gwilliams 2012; Mehndiratta, Rodriguez, and Ochoa 2014; Serebrisky and
others 2009). But experience with demand-side subsidies is mixed, with difficul-
­
ties identifying and reaching target populations and potential abuse of subsidies
(such as transferring them to unintended recipients). Other approaches have
included Bilete Unico, operational in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, which caps
the fare for multimodal trips and subsidizes feeder transport (such as cable cars
in Rio de Janeiro and Medellín that connect poorer neighborhoods to main tran-
sit arteries and allow a certain number of free trips per day [Rodriguez and others
2016]). But both programs contribute to urban sprawl and suffer from errors of
inclusion (wealthier persons using these lower-cost options).
    Encouragingly, subsidy efforts are becoming more sophisticated as technol-
ogy makes disbursement more effective and efficient. In Bogota, transport
subsidies are disbursed on travel cards linked to the Sistema Nacional de Selección
de Beneficiarios (SISBEN), the national database of potential beneficiaries for
social support programs (TransMilenio 2015, Rodriguez and others 2016).
The program disburses the subsidy as a half-off fare when the card is used to
pay for public transport (capped at 40 trips a month). The program builds on
the growing use of electronic fare media (smart cards) in Bogotá’s public tran-
sit systems and national experience with other poverty-targeting initiatives
(such as conditional cash transfer programs) that use SISBEN. Fraud attempts
are deterred through the use of biometric identification and requirements for
photo IDs.
    Still, the continued strong presence of informal transport modes indicates that
transport needs are not being met by formal public transport services. Informal
transport systems are especially common among poorer households that are not
served by or cannot afford formal transport. Relative to formal transport, infor-
mal transport can be more accessible, flexible, reliable, faster, and cheaper. But
the vehicles are typically not suited to collective transport. They are often
unregulated, in oversupply, unsafe, and unpredictable. And even though informal
transport is an important source of employment, it is also a major cause of con-
gestion and pollution. The most common examples of informal transport systems
are the vans and mini/micro buses used in cities like Brasilia, San Salvador, and
Santo Domingo. Other examples are motorcycle taxis in Lima, Fortaleza, and
Santo Domingo (Jirón 2013).

         More generally, safety is a major challenge, with traffic deaths a serious issue
      across Latin America, and not just in urban areas. When weighted by population,
      the death rate from road traffic accidents in the region is more than 19 per
      100,000 people—three to four times that in Europe (UN-Habitat 2013).
      In addition, women are often sexually harassed on public transport, undermining
      their ability to safely participate in economic and social activities (box 1.3).

      Water and Sanitation: Good Coverage for Water, but Sanitation an
      Increasingly Urgent Challenge
      Good water and sanitation coverage is critical to public health, especially in areas
      with high human density, pollution, or both. In addition, inadequate access usu-
      ally implies that households have to spend more time and money getting water.
      While Latin America has made good progress on increasing the share of house-
      holds with access to water, it has not done as well on sanitation. Many households
      lack access to improved sanitation, and only about 30 percent of the region’s
      wastewater is treated. These shortfalls caused a loss of 941,000 disability-adjusted
      life years (DALYs) across the region in 2012, concentrated in Bolivia, Brazil,
      Guatemala, Haiti, and Mexico (figure 1.13).
          Water and sanitation have traditionally represented a small share of Latin
      America’s investments in infrastructure, hovering between a quarter and a third
      of a percent of GDP (figure 1.14). Funding has predominantly come from the
      public sector, though the past few years have seen an increase in private funding
      that has helped offset a dip in public spending.

      Water: Good Progress on Access, but No Room for Complacency
      Some 94 percent of households have access to an improved source of drink-
      ing water, placing Latin America in the top ranks of developing regions—though
      still short of the 99 percent in high-income countries (figure 1.15, panel a).



      Box 1.3  Public Transport for All? Sexual Harassment Is a Major Issue on Public
      Transport in Latin America
      Safety for women is one component of transport quality that is often overlooked. Sexual
      harassment and assault are higher in Latin America’s major metropolitan areas than else-
      where. Women in the region consistently report feeling less safe than women in European
      metropolitan areas. In Bogotá, Lima, Mexico City, and Santiago, 60–90 percent of women
      report experiencing sexual harassment or assault on public transport in any given year. Actual
      levels of sexual harassment and assault could be higher because reporting rates are low.
      Brazil and Mexico have implemented “women-only” cars on trains and subways. But their
      reception has been mixed; some argue that they do not address the cultural norms that rein-
      force sexual violence, while others note that they pose issues for women traveling with boys
      or elderly men.

 Rethinking Infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean

                   Moreover, this average masks a large gap between rural (84 percent) and urban
                   (97 percent) coverage (figure 1.15, panel b). In fact, whereas coverage is lower
                   for poor households, the rural/urban divide trumps income as a marker for lack
                   of access to an improved drinking water source (figure 1.15, panel c).
                      The region’s relatively high coverage is no cause for complacency. More than
                   20 million people, mostly in rural areas, lack access to an improved source of
                   drinking water, three-quarters of them in six countries—Brazil, Colombia,
                   Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico, and Peru—that include the region’s richest and poorest
                   countries. The type of service also differs between rural and urban areas, with 94
                   of the urban population with access to water served with piped water on their
                   premises, but only 68 percent in rural areas (WHO and UNICEF 2016).
                      Further, the quality of “access to an improved water source” is often poor.
                   About a quarter of those with access get it by informal means (Borja-Vega,
                   Perochena, and Zuilu 2015).7 Quality is often inadequate, with implications for
                   public health. But data are weak, partly because measuring water quality is dif-
                   ficult and expensive at scale. A pilot effort to use a rapid quality assessment
                   deployed across Nicaragua found that 16 percent of water points posed high to
                   extremely high sanitary risk. In addition, reliability is an issue even in relatively
                   privileged urban areas, with 13 percent of the population surveyed in a sample
                   of the region’s largest cities reporting they do not have continuous daily service
                   (figure 1.16).

                        While Latin America’s utilities perform reasonably well, most could do better,
                     as measured by their gap with the top 10 percent of performers (figure 1.17).
                     The middle 80 percent in the International Benchmarking Network for Water
                     and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) database—which covers about 1,900 Latin
                     American utilities—average 80 percent metering, about 30 percent nonrevenue
                     water (that is, water lost or stolen, for which the utilities do not charge), and can
                     cover operational expenses but not much more from revenues. In contrast, the
                     top 10 percent achieve 100 percent metering, 15 percent nonrevenue water, and
                     full cost recovery.


                     Sanitation Performance Remains Poor, with Limited Access and Low
                     Wastewater Treatment
                     Only 83 percent of Latin America’s population has access to some form of sani-
                     tation, making the region’s relative and absolute performance much worse than
                     for water (figure 1.18, panel a). Again, rural areas have worse service coverage
                     (64 percent) than do urban areas (88 percent), with poverty being more of a
                     marker for lack of access than living in rural areas (figure 1.18, panel b).
                     Colombia and Paraguay stand out, with access in the bottom rural quintile at 40
                     percent—half or less than the national average (figure 1.18, panel c).
                        Wastewater treatment and reuse is also low in Latin America. Data are
                     scarce, but it is estimated that only about 30 percent of the region’s
                     wastewater is treated—with significant implications for public health and
                     environmental sustainability. This average masks significant variation across
                     countries, from 4 percent of wastewater treated in Costa Rica to 99 percent

    One of the most concerning aspects of the institutional environment for
 wastewater is the inadequate attention paid to the regulating, monitoring, and
 enforcing provisions designed to restrict industrial discharge into receiving
 water bodies. Enforcement of industrial pretreatment to remove heavy metals,
 organic compounds, and other contaminants is needed to prevent damage to
 pipe infrastructure, ensure that biological treatment processes work effectively,
 and keep harmful concentrations from preventing the reuse of sludge as a
 fertilizer.
    The poor performance of most Latin American countries in wastewater treat-
 ment stands out compared to other infrastructure sectors, and so merits more

      in-depth analysis. Background work for this report identifies several causes of this
      poor performance (Nolasco 2016):

      •	 Split responsibilities between central government agencies that fund construction
         and local governments without the technical and financial resources to run treat-
         ment plants. In Mexico, for example, the federal government is responsible for
         designing and constructing wastewater treatment plants, while cities are
         charged with their operation and maintenance. But most cities do not charge
         for sanitation. Where costs are passed on to users, tariffs are often insufficient
         to cover even operating costs. This disconnect between the central agency that
         designs and builds wastewater treatment facilities and the subnational agencies
         that operate them also exists in Argentina and Peru.

      •	 Overly ambitious “imported” regulations that leave no room for gradualism. Many
         Latin American countries have adopted legislation developed in high-income
         countries that have strong institutional and technical capacity and high finan-
         cial support from both government and users. Such legislation often imposes
         standards that are unrealistic and unaffordable. To illustrate: in Cordoba,
         Argentina, legislation implemented in 2015 requires that wastewater being
         discharged has a level of cleanliness that few treatment plants can meet even
         in high-income countries. The cost of operating the Cordoba plant far exceeds
         the municipality’s financing capacity. Further, in most countries, regulation is
         binding from the day of its passage, instead of offering a path toward gradual
         improvement in treatment coverage and quality. The region would be better
         served by focusing on a progressive array of appropriate treatment technolo-
         gies, starting with cheaper, lower-cost solutions, followed by upgrades to more
         advanced technologies as and when financial resources allow.

      •	 Limitations on resource recovery. Few utilities, even in high-income countries,
         charge users the full cost of wastewater treatment. This is partly because
         households are reluctant to pay for a service that they feel may benefit others
         as much as themselves, but also because in low- and middle-income countries
         the cost would be high for an average household to bear in full. As such, public
         subsidies may be justified. But costs could also be substantially lowered—and
         wastewater plants transformed from cost to revenue centers—if countries in
         the region could stop treating wastewater treatment sludge as dangerous solid
         waste and instead allow the reuse of gray waters. Lima, a large city in the
         middle of a desert, discharges its wastewater into the ocean and disposes of its
         sludge in expensive sanitary landfills, instead of allowing the agriculture indus-
         try to make use of these nutrient-rich bio solids. Similarly, efforts to use elec-
         tricity generated by treatment plants are seldom encouraged. Exceptions
         include the Tenorio treatment plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, which pro-
         vides advanced primary treatment for 60 percent of the wastewater (which is
         then used for irrigation), and generates electricity for both own consumption
         and for sale—saving US$18 million over a six-year period.

•	 Infrastructure not adapted for poor people. Sewerage systems often suffer if they
   provide piping through neighborhoods, because either resources or interest is
   lacking to make final connections between the piping and businesses. Examples
   abound. In Guayaquil, Ecuador, where 30,000 households remain unconnected
   30 years after sewerage pipes were installed, about 31 percent of households
   surveyed noted that money was a key impediment to connection (Poveda and
   others 2014). A number of countries in the region have developed schemes to
   tackle this issue (box 1.4).

Energy: A Sector at a Turning Point?
Latin America’s energy sector could be at a turning point (World Bank, forth-
coming a). The region is well positioned to close the remaining access gap—at
least for electricity, as the need for clean and efficient cooking fuel has not
received enough support in most countries. But shifts in demand associated with
urbanization and a growing middle class, together with climate change, are creat-
ing both new challenges and opportunities.



Box 1.4  Innovative Schemes to Expand Sewerage Services across Latin America
In Brazil, where cost is a significant barrier to the expansion of sewerage in major cities, at least
three utilities have taken steps to create more pro-poor services. EMBASA, Bahia state’s utility,
implemented an innovative program between 1995 and 2007 to introduce “condominial” sew-
erage to low-income neighborhoods. This program was a city block-based approach that
relied on community consultations to design low-cost joint sewerage facilities. It placed the
responsibility for final linkups on groups of households rather than individual households.
    Similar schemes have been pioneered by CAESB, Brasilia’s state water utility. Under its con-
dominial scheme, connections to the main public sewers are constructed after the targeted
community signs an agreement setting out the rights and obligations of all partners.
The investment cost of the system is kept low by the use of small bore pipes, starting at diam-
eters of just 100 millimeters (Shankland and others 2010). Another Brazilian utility, SABESP,
targeted the last-mile problem by offering subsidies and payment by installment for connect-
ing households to sewerage services. Finally, in the state of Minas Gerais, the state water utility
COPASA has established a subsidiary that offers pro-poor tariffication and technologies.
Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay are also implementing projects to tackle sewerage for the poor,
but those countries have yet to develop them at scale.
    Elsewhere, public-private partnerships for wastewater treatment plants appear to be work-
ing well. A perfect example is the Atotonilco de Tula plant in Mexico, which treats wastewater
generated in the valley of Mexico. It is 54 percent funded by the private sector and is operated
by a private consortium. There are also examples of private businesses building wastewater
treatment plants to make use of municipally discharged wastewater—for example, the
Enlozada-Cerro Verde treatment plant in Arequipa, Peru, was built and operated by the mining
company Cerro Verde, which uses the treated water at its mine site.

                      Investments in energy dropped dramatically in the early 2000s and have been
                   slowly recovering since, hovering around 0.75–1.00 percent of GDP in recent
                   years (figure 1.20, panel a). The drop was driven by a sharp and sudden decline
                   in private flows to the sector, from about 1.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to about
                   0.2 percent four years later. Private flows have slowly and unevenly increased in
                   recent years, to account for some two-thirds of energy investments in the region
                   in 2012 (figure 1.20, panel b).

                   If Given Enough Attention, the Access Gap Could Be Closed
                   Latin America has fairly high access to electricity and modern (nonsolid)
                   fuels, with access rates of 96 percent in electricity and 84 percent in nonsolid
                   fuels (figure 1.21). This is well above the developing country averages, estimated
                   at 86 percent and 59 percent, and on par with the middle-income average for
                   electricity.
                      Nevertheless, 22 million Latin Americans remain without access to electricity
                   (more than half of them in Haiti and rural Guatemala and Peru), and 87 million
                   lack access to nonsolid fuels (three-quarters of them in Brazil, Guatemala, Haiti,
                   Mexico, and Peru; figure 1.22). Electrification rates are increasing throughout the
                   region, but for access to nonsolid fuels, slow progress in a number of countries
                   (such as Guatemala and República Bolivariana de Venezuela) means that these
                   countries are unlikely to attain universal access any time soon.
                      A major issue is inequality of access for both electricity and nonsolid
                   fuels—not only in countries with lower levels of access such as Haiti, Guatemala,
                   Guyana, and Honduras, but also in upper-middle-income countries such as
                   Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Access is mostly a challenge in rural areas, but some
                   periurban areas and slums lack access or have unreliable, illegal, and unsafe

electricity supplies. Low quality of life, severe health problems, poor education
and medical care, and limited opportunities for raising incomes and living stan-
dards are associated with a lack of electricity and nonsolid fuels.
   The need for cleaner, more efficient cooking has not received enough policy
and financial support in the region. More than half of the population in
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua use solid fuel for cooking. Even in rela-
tively wealthy Mexico, this share is 14 percent. These levels are worrisome given
the association between indoor air pollution and acute lower respiratory infec-
tion and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2 of the top 10 causes of death
in Latin America (IHME and World Bank 2013).

                      Affordability remains a major barrier to increased access to electricity. Even
                   with social tariffs, subsistence electricity consumption is not affordable to the
                   poor in many Latin American countries (figure 1.23). In Bolivia, Colombia,
                   Guatemala, and Mexico, the cost of subsistence electricity—30 kilowatt-hours a
                   month, enough for limited lighting, a television, a fan, and one medium-power
                   appliance—imposes an unacceptable burden for the poorest 40 percent of the
                   ­
                   population. Part of the problem is that electricity subsidies are not always well
                   targeted. Electricity subsidies are regressive in every Central American country—
                   to give an example, in Panama, for every US$1 of subsidies received by the
                   poorest 10 percent of households, the richest 10 percent gets US$4.4 (Hernandez
                   ­
                   Ore and others, forthcoming).
                      On a more positive note, except for Haiti and Honduras, countries with the
                   lowest levels of electricity access have implemented policies that should increase it.
                   The energy access pillar of the Readiness for Investment in Sustainable Energy
                   (RISE) index, which includes indicators to assess how far countries have gone in
                   introducing the key policies, regulations, and plans needed to increase energy access
                   and attract private participation (based on current good practice), shows most
                   Latin American countries to be doing well. But Haiti, with energy access levels
                   similar to those in Afghanistan and Somalia, is still lacking the core elements of an
                   energy access program (an officially approved electrification plan, a framework for
                   grid electrification, or even a framework for off-grid electrification based on stand-
                   alone systems). Honduras has also progressed slowly on all these fronts, with policy
                   and planning instruments that consider some good practice elements but not all.

                   A Gap Remains between the World’s Best Performers and Latin America’s
                   Major Utilities
                   Latin America pioneered electricity market reforms and what became known as
                   the orthodoxy of the 1990s (unbundle, privatize, regulate). As a result, several

Note: Affordability is measured in the annual cost of subsistence consumption as a percentage of bottom 40 percent
household income. The analysis is based on national social tariffs (and not on special programs applying to subnational
levels). Electricity is generally considered affordable if annual expenditure on a volume of subsistence consumption is less
than or equal to 5 percent of income. Preliminary work from World Bank Energy Global Practice. kWh = kilowatt hours.



countries in the region have highly sophisticated electricity markets, with good
governance and regulatory certainty. More generally, most countries in the region
have functional electricity markets, and the region has built a wealth of experi-
ence with the design and operation of electricity markets (box 1.5).
   The reforms strengthened the performance of many utilities, some of which
have grown to become multinational companies or at least companies able to sell
shares through stock markets to finance their investment plans (such as ISA, the
state-controlled electricity grid operator of Colombia, Empresas Públicas de
Medellín). But a few still struggle with service quality and financial sustainability.
That may be due to the reversal of reforms in some countries or to the lack of
managerial expertise in some utilities. And overall, there is still a gap between
most Latin American utilities and global best performers (figure 1.24).

Electricity Is Clean but Vulnerable to Climate Shocks and Still Has Lots to
Gain from “Negawatts”
With 56 percent of installed electricity generating capacity in renewable sources,
Latin America has the world’s cleanest electricity sector. But much of this
depends on hydroelectricity, which has suffered from droughts brought on by
climate change and poor water resource management. As a result, the share
of electricity produced from renewable sources has been falling in recent
years, reaching 53 percent in 2013 (figure 1.25). In January 2015, São Paolo’s

    reservoir hydroelectric system fell below 3 percent of its 264 billion gallon
six-­
capacity, forcing blackouts throughout the region (Poindexter 2015). Reservoir
expansion in the region may be difficult given the mounting opposition to large
hydroelectric projects, including the 11.2 gigawatt Belo Monte project in Brazil’s
Amazon as well as Chile’s five-dam HidroAysen project (Tissot 2012). Other
                                                                       ­ iofuels—
forms of renewable energy—geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, biomass, and b
contribute only a sliver of electricity production in the region (10 percent in
2013) and have ramped up too slowly to offset the decline of hydroelectricity.
   While nonhydro renewables are a rather new phenomenon in Latin America,
such investments are rising. The region has seen rapid growth in solar photovol-
taic (PV) plants, with a doubling of regional capacity in 2015—though from a
low baseline. Similarly, onshore wind investments have been growing since 2008
(figure 1.26). Significant small hydropower and bioenergy investments are made
every year, while geothermal investment appears irregularly, with a limited num-
ber of projects under development in the region. Private investment in renew-
ables has also gradually increased in the region, mostly to support wind-based
generation and mainly concentrated in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru.
(Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Central American countries also attracted
modest private sector investment in renewable energy in 2008–14.)
   With its reliance on renewables and vulnerability to climate shocks, Latin
America would benefit enormously from good regional interconnections. But
many existing interconnections are not used because of technical, regulatory, and
market barriers.8 For example, regional power trade in Central America, includ-
ing interconnection with Mexico, was just 2–4 percent of potential trading capac-
ity in 2012 and 2013. Power exchanges between Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay
have also been consistently low. Electrons are not flowing across borders—or
at least, many fewer than there could be.

   Another factor that could help the region keep its low energy emission foot-
print, as well as reduce vulnerability, would be increased energy efficiency. Latin
America’s energy intensity is the lowest of any region, largely because of the
nature of its economic activities. But energy efficiency, particularly in the use of
fossil fuels, remains poor. And the region could reduce transmission and distribu-
tion losses, which are the highest of any region except the Middle East and North
Africa (and three times those of East Asia; figure 1.27).


Conclusions
One way to interpret the diagnostic laid out above is to argue that Latin America’s
infrastructure performance is rather mediocre for an upper-middle-income region
with significant growth aspirations. Another is to highlight the many examples
of the region’s capacity for innovative solutions, its expertise with sophisticated
regulations, and its experience with PPPs. In sum, Latin America has the means
and potential to do better. And it can do so by spending more efficiently on the
right things.
   So, where to go with this diagnostic? The next section turns to the challenges
and opportunities that will shape how Latin America can or should tackle its
infrastructure agenda.


Notes
	 1.	Henceforth we use Latin America as shorthand for Latin America and the Caribbean.
	 2.	Brazil represents about 44 percent of the region’s GDP, Mexico about 25 percent, and
     Argentina 10 percent.
	 3.	Based on data from Ruiz-Nuñez (2016).
	 4.	Governments can offer indirect support through guarantees to reduce specific
     project risks—for example, payment, revenue, and exchange rate guarantees.
     They can also provide direct support to deals from their budgets in case user fees
     or power or water purchase agreements with private entities or wholesale
     markets are not possible or sufficient (in some cases, government may collect
     user fees but provide availability payments to the private entities bearing the
     demand risk).
	 5.	See, for example, research cited in Ali and others (2015) that used high-resolution
     imagery to analyze the impact of new road construction on deforestation in Brazil
     (Laurance, Goosem, and Laurance 2009) and Bolivia, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru
     (Reymondin and others 2013).
	 6.	Based on BRTdata.org, urbanrail.net, metrobits.org, and UNDESA (2014).
	 7.	This share is inferred by looking at the share of the urban population that lives in
     slums and other informal settlements that utilities may not be allowed to serve.
	8.	The region has four clusters of interconnection: Mexico-United States, Central
    America, Andean Community (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, República Bolivariana de
    Venezuela), and Southern Cone (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay).

What Lies Ahead for the Region’s
Infrastructure?




Latin America faces many challenges and opportunities as it contemplates
where and how to improve its infrastructure. Some of these are new, such as
climate change and the policy and technology shifts associated with it.
Others, such as urbanization and a growing middle class, have been long in
the making but have reached a scale that puts the region in a different realm
of demand and delivery options. And others are familiar, such as the fiscal
space challenge and generally poor spending efficiency that have long plagued
Latin America.

Inefficient Public Spending May Limit How Much More Should Go
to Infrastructure
A recent analysis of infrastructure governance in Brazil concluded that “creating
additional space for investment may not lead to economic growth or better infra-
structure services, unless the management of capital projects is considerably
improved” (World Bank, forthcoming b, 3). And while in-depth analysis of infra-
structure planning and investment frameworks is rare—in Latin America and
elsewhere—it is possible to glean insights from both public expenditure and
investment management analysis and the 20 or so reasonably recent World Bank
public expenditures reviews that have addressed at least one infrastructure sec-
tor. (See appendix A for a list.)
   A review of these works shows that inefficient public spending on infrastruc-
ture in Latin America has myriad causes. Many of the causes lie outside infra-
structure sectors or are systemic across government agencies—but all converge
around a lack of institutional capacity for planning, capital budgeting, and imple-
mentation. Issues include weak appraisal and preparation capacity, overly rigid
budgeting rules designed to control cash expenditures rather than improve
spending ­ efficiency, difficulties with budget execution, inefficient procurement
procedures, and a systemic bias against capital spending. Many of these causes are

      compounded by limited coordination between sector agencies and central and
      subnational governments. These points, developed below, suggest substantial
      potential for efficiency gains.

      Weak Planning, Project Appraisal, and Preparation Capacity
      Public investment management systems are inefficient across the region, though
      some countries are better than others. Most countries have public investment
      management systems whose original goal was to standardize capital budget
      preparation by setting legal procedures for project identification and budgeting.
      A World Bank/IMF Public Investment Management index (PIMI) (Dabla-Norris
      and others 2012) found that Latin America has low investment efficiency, with
      significant variations across countries, mainly determined by how old systems are.
      The study analyzed four stages of infrastructure management—appraisal (includ-
      ing planning), selection, implementation, and evaluation—and found appraisal
      and evaluation to be the weakest stages. A 2016 study reached similar conclu-
      sions (Armendáriz and Contreras 2016).
         Longer-term infrastructure planning is undermined by short-term pressures.
      The region’s public investment management systems were built with a strong
      focus on managing fiscal deficits and, therefore, maintaining strong controls on
      actual cash expenditure. There is a disconnect between decentralized project
      planning responsibilities in sector agencies and overall fiscal targets and plans.
      This disconnect emerges because agencies develop plans separately from bud-
      get discussions. For example, a 2015 World Bank perception survey of project
      managers in Jamaica concluded that only 13 percent of government projects
      were aligned with a high-level strategic goal.1 In Haiti, a lack of coordination
      among key agencies and the absence of an integrated budget are major chal-
      lenges. Whereas the country has a detailed, comprehensive budget cycle for
      investments, the budget still fails to incorporate long-term decision making in
      several ways.
         Another issue is the complex interplay between politics and planning.
      Spending efficiently requires a sober assessment of any project’s net benefits to
      society. Projects should be prioritized against each other, across sectors, and over
      time—thereby turning wish lists into strategies. That approach requires a politi-
      cal mandate, a process for generating such a mandate, and institutional capacity
      to manage such a process (in an infrastructure unit, the ministry of finance or
      planning, or the president’s office). Key, however, is a robust public investment
      management process that ensures quality.
         However, a lack of public investment management-based quality control
      leads to projects being funded that are not sufficiently prepared. A 2014
      United Nations–Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
      survey of 15 Latin American economies found that in 5 countries, public-­
      private partnership (PPP) projects can bypass public investment management
      system controls, while in 4 more, significant exceptions can be obtained
      (Perrotti and Rueda 2015). Brazil has a multiyear planning process, but it is
      seen more as a bureaucratic burden than as an instrument for medium-term

planning (World Bank, forthcoming b). In addition, parliamentary amendments
to annual budget laws can add substantially to planned investments (some
33 percent in 2015). A recent study consequently concludes that “the combina-
tion of weak capacity, lax enforcement, and pork-barrel politics means that
investment projects can be included in ministerial budgets without having been
subject to formal appraisal” (World Bank, forthcoming b).
   In terms of quality control, the situation is often worse at the subnational
level. States and municipalities frequently face a lack of human and technical
capacity to manage large-scale investments. The state of Rio de Janeiro has a
multiannual plan to guide its investment decisions, but day-to-day decisions are
at the mercy of political and sectoral considerations that lead to ad hoc budget
allocations (World Bank 2012a). Subnational levels sometimes follow national
level guidelines and manuals for project appraisal without properly understand-
ing them. In addition, subnational levels often see the use of national guidelines
and manuals as a purely formal prerequisite for applying for national funding
rather than as a way to strengthen their own decision-making process.2

Overly Rigid or Myopic Budgeting
In the region, annual budget rules limit the inclusion of large and long-term
projects. Most public investment projects are funded on an annual basis, mean-
ing these projects need to be executed in less than a year according to tight
fiscal calendars. Of over 23 Latin American countries that had Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) analysis done since 2006,
only one got an A rating (Colombia) on the PEFA indicator that captures the
existence of sector strategies with multiyear costing of recurrent and invest-
ment expenditure (table 2.1). Out of a portfolio of 42,810 projects registered
in Bolivia’s project data bank (SISIN) until 2013, nearly 70 percent were for
two years or less. Less than 1 percent of Peru’s nearly 220,000 public projects
registered between 2000 and 2015 at national and subnational levels had a
duration of three or more years.
   There is growing realization that this is an issue, and some countries are work-
ing on reforms. Colombia, for example, has a strong planning system and has
introduced medium-term expenditures frameworks. However, it still has a com-
plex process for multiannual budget allocations for projects that requires
approval by a specialized committee and dedicated cabinet approval.
   Further, the effectiveness of budget allocations is limited by a lack of informa-
tion about and timeliness of financial flows to projects. This hampers project
managers’ capacity to do financial planning during project implementation
stages. In Jamaica, the same survey of project managers found that over
70 percent of projects received information about financial flows three months
or less before scheduled project start. In Mexico’s water sector, unwieldy budget-
ary rules squeeze the budget cycle in a way that makes it difficult to engage in
multiyear budgeting and properly execute capital budgets. This is because
resources are not released until a technical agreement is signed between the
federal water agency and participating states—expected by March 31 but

      sometimes delayed—and any resources unspent by December 31 must be
      returned. This tight schedule results in less competitive procurement procedures
      and low budget execution (World Bank 2014b).
          Finally, the fiscal calendar is often misaligned with the project implementation
      calendar. The Latin American fiscal year is the calendar year, which results in
      fiscal authorities requesting deliverables and payments before the end of the year.
      ­
      However, for most infrastructure projects, the right time to do investment is dur-
      ing the dry or summer season that happens between November and March. In
      response, some countries have created fiduciary funds to avoid this budget rigid-
      ity, while others chose PPPs or struggled with multiannual allocations.

      Difficulties with Budget Execution
      Many countries struggle with the execution of capital budgets (figure 2.1).
      This is a particular issue in Brazil where disbursement data show a chronic
      gap between committed and executed funds. This problem was exacerbated
      by the transformation of the Pilot Program of Investments into the much
      more ambitious Program of Growth Acceleration, which increased public
      investments from 0.7 of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to 1.3 per-
      cent in 2012. In 2013, the Federal Audit Court found that a third of road
      construction and management projects were paralyzed for a variety of rea-
      sons, and three-quarters of projects with fully committed funds had an
      execution rate of less than 25 percent. The court also found serious irregu-
      larities in 58 of the 102 large infrastructure projects it audited (World Bank,
      forthcoming b).

    Low- or medium-level budget execution has many causes. For example, in
Honduras, cash rationing is considered the main driver of low budget execution
in infrastructure investments, as money is siphoned off to protect current expen-
ditures. Furthermore, budget execution is defined as accrued expenses rather
than actual payments, resulting in perpetually overstated budget capacity (World
Bank 2013a).
    Chronic overexecution is also symptomatic of poor budgeting. In Guatemala,
the budgetary requirements of the perpetually underfunded road ministry were
estimated in 2010 to be four times its US$1 billion budget. These funding
requirements include projects that are approved but not executed, as well as
projects executed but where the contractor has not yet been paid for its work. To
compensate for the lack of funds, the ministry often receives transfers from min-
istries that have more funds than they can fully execute. That, combined with
frequent cost overruns in road projects, led the road ministry to execute 120–200
percent of its budget between 2006 and 2008 (World Bank 2013d). This effec-
tively undermines the annual budget process’ ability to guide fiscal policy.

Procurement That Could Be Improved
Inefficient procurement processes contribute to limited budget execution.
Capital expenditures depend on procurement policies for the timely provision of
goods and services. Some procurement or budget laws do not allow agencies to
start the procurement process before a budget appropriation has been given. This
causes unnecessary delays. In Jamaica, the project manager survey revealed that
76 percent of the projects faced delays on the implementation of their procure-
ment plans.

         In addition, better procurement could save significant resources in many
      Latin American countries. For example, it is estimated that Costa Rica could
      have saved 13–18 percent of its 2008 budget by taking advantage of procure-
      ment practices such as reverse auctions, consolidated purchases, and clearer
      standards (World Bank 2008). In Haiti, excessively high thresholds for public
      tendering of works, goods, and services result in overreliance on direct procure-
      ment or noncompetitive invoicing (World Bank 2016). Guatemala has no
      systematic procurement reviews for the procurement of goods and services,
      ­
      many of which occur in infrastructure sectors (World Bank 2013d). In Brazil,
      adjustments of 25–50 percent of initial cost estimates are allowed to preserve
      “economic-financial equilibrium,” encouraging underbidding and overcharging
      (World Bank 2014a).
         Some economies in the region such as Chile, Mexico, and Brazil have seen
      remarkable success in driving procurement reforms. In Chile for example, the
      ChileCompra electronic portal is estimated to have generated US$280 million
      in savings. Mexico’s modernization of its tendering processes (which involved
      eliminating 586 obsolete procurement regulations and creating an online plat-
      form to boost transparency and ease of access) generated savings of more than
      US$1 billion within three years of its 2009 start (World Bank 2013c). In Brazil,
      a reform establishing an e-procurement system led to 51 percent savings in
      transaction costs and 25.5 percent reduction in prices between 2000 and 2006
      (Hunja 2012).
         But detailed analysis of procurement performance in Latin America and
      the Caribbean (LAC), both general and of public private partnerships, shows
      there is considerable room for improvement (see appendix B for a more detailed
      review). The region’s reasonably good average performance compared to others
      hides wide variation both across countries and across different aspects of perfor-
      mance. The World Bank’s Benchmarking Public Procurement 2017 found that
      suppliers identify obstacles such as excessive bureaucracy and red tape in
      Colombia and Honduras; payment delays in Argentina, the Dominican Republic,
      and Jamaica; lack of transparency and opaque tendering processes in Brazil and
      Mexico; lack of efficiency in Barbados and Puerto Rico; the list goes on.

      Insufficient Attention to Social and Environmental Risk Management
      Adequate social and environmental risk management3 helps secure popular sup-
      port for a project—a “social license to operate”—which reduces business costs by
      reducing project delays, cost overruns, and reputational risk to investors
      (Stapledon 2012). Data from the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Peru
      showed that delays associated with land acquisition and expropriation signifi-
      cantly delayed projects. The ministry found that these delays caused substantial
      increases in project costs (table 2.2).
         In Latin America, while some countries have put in place relevant policies
      and procedures to address sustainability in infrastructure, there is still a long
      road ahead. Yet when social sustainability dimensions are not clearly
      understood and properly analyzed, decision makers tend to ignore them until

they flare up and directly threaten project implementation (Geurs, Boon, and
Van Wee 2009).
   Another area in which social and environmental risk management is underval-
ued is feasibility studies. As in other regions, feasibility studies in Latin America
tend to focus on engineering as well as economic and financial analysis.
They seldom make use of other tools, such as environmental and social impact
assessments and stakeholder engagement, or pay due attention to Free, Prior, and
Informed Consent rules.
   Attention to these issues can help avoid later complications, reduce negative
impacts, and compensate for any residual impacts. In the experience of the World
Bank, feasibility studies sometimes fail to adequately assess project sites, unfore-
seen site conditions including social and economic activities, existing utilities, and,
most important, contextual risk. Moreover, feasibility studies must integrate the
projects’ unique characteristics in order to properly analyze their potential distri-
butional impacts on diverse social groups, both spatially and temporally. A flexi-
ble and adaptive social and environmental management system in which the level
of effort to manage the risks is proportionate to the degree of the risks in the
infrastructure projects improves projects’ chances of success.

Unclear Project Sustainability
An imbalance between capital and current spending on infrastructure is a
chronic problem around the world. It can spring from overly rigid budgets and
suboptimal planning. Of the 23 Latin American countries that had PEFA analysis
since 2006, only three ever got a rate of B (Guatemala, Peru, and Trinidad and
Tobago) on the indicator capturing the link between investment budgets and
forward expenditure estimates (table 2.3).
   The imbalance is also frequently because of poor coordination between
central governments that fund and often manage capital investments and local
governments that may lack the financial and technical capacity to take over
these investments or cover operation and maintenance costs. In Honduras,
municipalities are legally mandated to invest 50–70 percent of the transfers
they receive from the central government, but because transfers are unpredict-
able in both timing and amount, municipal leaders tend to front-load recurrent
expenditures (for example, salaries and interest payments) and use whatever is

      left for investment (World Bank 2013a). Peru has the opposite problem: the
      fiscal responsibility law’s requirement that mining revenues (canons) be dedi-
      cated to investments has led to an imbalance between capital and current
      expenditures in local budgets and the need for the central government to step
      in for critical current spending (World Bank 2012b).

      A Tight Fiscal Stance Limits How Much More Could Be Spent
      on Infrastructure
      Improved efficiency is not just good policy; it may well be the only option in the
      short to medium term to increase resources available given the region’s tight fis-
      cal position. This is not new. Fiscal constraints have long influenced both infra-
      structure investments and policies in the region.
          Infrastructure privatization and reforms in the 1990s were largely driven by
      fiscal concerns. While the reforms did ease the strain on public coffers, it quickly
      became clear that PPPs were no substitute for public investment in infrastruc-
      ture. As a result, by the early 2000s, it was clear that the region needed to invest
      more. But by then, Latin America was struggling with negative fiscal balances,
      which were raising fears of a return to hyperinflation and fiscal debacles. Pressure
      to limit spending combined with severe budget rigidities (typically due to a large
      share of the budget allocated to constitutionally mandated expenditures or to
      entitlements) meant that investments bore the brunt of the adjustments—even
      as some were arguing that infrastructure investments, being growth enhancing,
      should be increased. The debate raged on regarding whether fiscal space
      could be created at least for carefully selected growth-enhancing investments

(that in turn would create more fiscal space through growth). Most countries
opted not to for fear of jeopardizing credit ratings.
    Indeed, evidence shows that the evolution of the public sector’s budget
constraint—which plays a big role in shaping fiscal space—matters for the level
of infrastructure investment. Public investments in infrastructure in Latin
America respond to lagged changes in public savings. However, this response is
asymmetric, being stronger in good times (when lagged public savings rise) than
in bad times (when lagged public savings fall) (Serebrisky and others 2015).
    Many countries in Latin America are now facing persistent and often sizable
fiscal deficits, which is bound to impact their ability to undertake much-needed
public investments in infrastructure even with the asymmetry discussed above.
The overall fiscal picture is not uniform across the region.

Public Investments in Latin America: Rising during the Boom, but Still Much
Lower than in Other Regions
A narrative that has gained some traction in the region states that Latin America
squandered its opportunity to invest during the boom years of 2004–08 and
instead mostly expanded public consumption. That is not quite true. Total public
investment (not just infrastructure related) increased by 50 percent during
2004–08, while public consumption held steady. The reverse has happened since
2009, during the crisis years, with public investment declining while consump-
tion spending expanded (figure 2.2). However, throughout that time, public

                   consumption has remained many multiples of public investment, which hovered
                   around a modest 3.0–4.5 percent of GDP—significantly lower than among com-
                   petitors and peers, especially Asian ones (table 2.4).
                      The implications for infrastructure investment are dire. Though PPPs have
                   played an important role, they only represent about 40 percent of infrastructure
                   investments in the region. Further, about one-third of PPP financing comes from
                   public institutions (and about half of them rely on some type of government
                   support, creating contingent liabilities on public coffers). In other words, public
                   and private investments are complements rather than substitutes. Without vigor-
                   ous effort on the public side, infrastructure investments in the region are unlikely
                   to increase. In the absence of fiscal space, this vigorous effort would require
                   reducing public consumption to create space for public investments—something

                   A “Bifurcated” Fiscal Panorama in LAC
                   A highly heterogeneous fiscal space picture has emerged in the region, largely
                   driven by trade structure (de la Torre and others 2016). We can identify two
                   broad groups: (1) South America, dominated by net commodity exporters, which
                   are generally following China’s ups and downs; and (2) the Mexico-Central
                   America-Caribbean (MCC) group, where net commodity importers prevail, and
                   which is generally following the U.S. cycle. As figure 2.3 panels a and b show,
                   fiscal balances have deteriorated markedly in most of South America, but not so
                   much for the average MCC country.
                       But even within these broad groups, there is some heterogeneity. Fiscal
                   deterioration has varied among South American countries. Faster-growing
                   economies, such as Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru have fared better
                   fiscally than slower-growing ones, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Ecuador
                   (figure 2.3 panels c and d). On the whole, South American countries have

not yet succeeded in their adjustment efforts: fiscal deficits have widened as
expenditures continued to grow—with Ecuador a clear exception (figure 2.4,
panel a). Other important differences exist among South American countries,
attesting to the distinct nature of their fiscal woes: While interest payments
play an outsize role in Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay, primary expenditures
are the dominant factor in Argentina, Bolivia, and República Bolivariana de
Venezuela.
    In contrast, there has not been a dramatic, widespread deterioration of fiscal
balances in the MCC countries—even as they generally started from a weaker
fiscal stance than their South American counterparts. Indeed, there has been

some reduction in fiscal deficits, especially in the Caribbean (figure 2.4 panel b).
Fiscal consolidation occurred mostly through expenditure reductions rather than
through revenue increases. In the case of Jamaica, a massive reduction in its pri-
mary deficit was achieved, helping address the country’s hitherto unsustainable
debt trajectory. Nevertheless, in a few MCC countries (for example, Costa Rica
and Nicaragua), the fiscal situation remains uncomfortable, characterized by high
and increasing primary and/or overall fiscal deficits.
   The composition of adjustment matters. It has been all too common in the past
for countries to disproportionately cut capital expenditures as a more politically
expedient way of adjusting. It is still not entirely clear whether current or capital
spending is bearing the brunt of fiscal adjustment in the present round. Data
coming out of recent IMF staff reports show a mixed picture. Capital spending
as a share of GDP is projected to contract in Bolivia, Ecuador, and (to a lesser
extent) Jamaica and Mexico, while remaining broadly stable in Costa Rica and
Peru. More country-level information will be needed to ascertain clearly the
composition of fiscal adjustment in the region—and its implications for public
investments. The point remains, however, that few Latin American countries can
boast of ample fiscal space with which to finance a significant infrastructure
expansion.


Climate Change Is Creating New Challenges, but Possibly New
Opportunities
Changing climatic conditions, natural disasters, and extreme weather events are
affecting the ability of existing infrastructure to deliver services in Latin America.
Melting glaciers and recurrent droughts are undermining hydroelectric production
and may become a serious challenge for water-constrained cities. Storms, floods,
and landslides wash away roads and bridges and destroy other infrastructure. Thus,
infrastructure must become more resilient.
   At the same time, Latin America has the world’s cleanest energy matrix
and plenty of potential to further reduce emissions associated with
infrastructure—opportunities that carry local and immediate benefits such
as reduced air pollution and congestion. This offers the region a potential
competitive advantage, especially if carbon taxes are imposed in some of its
key export markets. So infrastructure also needs to be made cleaner and
more efficient.

Infrastructure Needs to Be More Resilient and Better Adapted to the
Changing Climate
Disaster and climate risks are expected to increase in the region, with implica-
tions for infrastructure development (box 2.1). Energy, transport, and water and
sanitation systems need to be built in more resilient ways to reduce disruptions
during extreme events. In addition, climate change will alter the demand for
infrastructure services: heat waves will increase electricity demand, droughts and

      Box 2.1  How Will Climate Change Affect Latin America?
      Latin America is exposed to many climate risks, most of which materialize through the water
      cycle. These risks vary by subregion but also depend on climate change. Impacts are expected
      to increase in intensity and severity as global temperatures continue to rise.

      •	 Most dry regions could get drier and most wet regions could get wetter. Increased rainfall in
         tropical and subtropical Pacific coastlines and southern Brazil is in contrast with decreased
         precipitation in the Caribbean, Central America, northeast and central Brazil, and Patagonia.
         Rainfall could decrease 20–40 percent if global warming increases 4°C above preindustrial
         temperatures (a “4°C world”).
      •	 Seasonal distribution of stream flows could become more variable. Glaciers could disappear
         in  a 4°C scenario and suffer considerable loss in a 2°C scenario. This retreat could cause
         glacial lake outbursts and flooding, as well as reduced water runoff in some river basins.
      •	 Increased risks of droughts and extreme heat could undermine seasonal water availability.
         Higher mean temperatures and increased rainfall variability could extend dry spells and
         drought conditions by up to 20 percent in a 4°C scenario.
      •	 More intense rainfalls could increase the risks of landslides. Excessive rainfall within short
         periods could overwhelm urban natural drainage systems. Landslide risks are highest on
         sloping terrain—where poor people often live.
      •	 The intensity and frequency of tropical storms will likely increase. The frequency of the stron-
         gest tropical cyclones could increase by 40 percent in a 2°C world and by 80 percent in a
         4°C world. Storms could increase coastal flooding, mostly in the Caribbean.
      •	 Higher sea levels could cause coastal flooding and erosion. Projections vary by zone and range
         from an average of 0.38 meters in a 2°C world to 1.14 meters in a 4°C world. Such extreme
         coastal flooding and rising sea levels could expose many zones to the risk of storm surges.

         Some of these risks will be conditioned by changes in ecosystems and feedback relation-
      ships. A 40 percent decrease in the Amazon’s forest area could be a potential tipping point at
      which forest-climate interactions could decrease precipitation. Forest cover loss is already
      associated with droughts in the Amazon.

      extreme rains will create the need for more water storage capacity, and increased
      flood risks will demand infrastructure solutions such as protective dams.
         Extreme events already cause extensive damage to infrastructure. Rapid loss
      and damage assessments done after natural disasters in Latin America suggest
      that infrastructure bears a disproportionate share of the costs. The transport sec-
      tor, in particular, bears a heavy burden (figure 2.5).
         Climate change can interact with infrastructure in many different ways
      including the following (Magrin and others 2014; World Bank 2014c):

      •	 Extreme events such as intense rainfalls and storms are already damaging trans-
         port systems and causing widespread disruptions. Intense rainfalls can cause flash
         floods and landslides, which can destroy bridges and other critical road

   segments—leading to high repair costs and severe travel disruptions. In coastal
   cities and on Caribbean islands, where most critical transport systems are in
   low-lying areas, these impacts could be especially large. More intense tropical
   cyclones in combination with rising sea levels could extend port downtimes
   for ships, raising shipping costs and reducing trade.
•	 Rising sea levels and intense El Niño events could threaten coastal infrastructure.
   Combined with tropical storms, these could mean that a 100-year flood
   event formerly reaching 2.8 meters could reach nearly 8.0 meters by
   midcentury. This is a major concern given that 42,600 square kilometers
   containing more than 7.5 million inhabitants, and built capital valued at
   US$334 billion are situated at elevations below today’s 100-year extreme sea
   level (Reguero and others 2015).

options (to retrofit existing infrastructure or design new infrastructure), techno-
logical and ecosystem-based options (such as protecting systems through conser-
vation or restoration of natural systems), and institutional actions (such as
rerouting of roads and electricity grids, reducing exposure to hazards).
   Given the long lifespan of most infrastructure, robust design options and
adaptive pathways that build in flexibility are needed to manage future uncer-
tainties (box 2.2). Although resilience planning is still a nascent field—especially
in the transport and electricity sectors—there is growing recognition that uncer-
tainties about future climate impacts need to be incorporated in today’s invest-
ment decisions. A recent analysis by the World Bank and SEDAPAL, Lima’s
water utility, did just that and developed a robust investment strategy that
ensures water reliability across as wide a range of future conditions as possible
(Kalra and others 2015). Other key water utilities in the region—such as Aguas
de Manizales in Colombia and Empresa Pública Metropolitana de Alcantarillado
y Agua Potable de Quito in Ecuador—have also conducted comprehensive risk
studies to prepare for extreme events (Balcázar 2012).
   Resilient strategies need not necessarily cost more. The resilient investment
plan developed by Lima’s water utility (box 2.2) resulted in changed rather
than more investment, which should reduce investment costs by 25 percent,
thanks to an increased emphasis on demand-side management, and a focus on
“no-regret” investments (Kalra and others 2015).
   But estimating an overall cost of adapting to climate change is made difficult,
if not impossible, by the fact that adaptation costs are highly situation and ­ site
specific. Not surprisingly then, available estimates vary greatly along with the
cost elements and climate scenarios considered. One study estimated that for

      Brazil alone, some US$50 billion of capital investments would be needed to
      ensure reliable electricity supply by 2035 because of the projected lack of reli-
      ability of hydroelectricity (de Lucena, Schaeffer, and Szklo 2010). Background
      work for this report suggests that providing additional reservoir capacity to meet
      future industrial and municipal water demand across Latin America could cost
      US$44 billion to US$57 billion between now and 2050—an annual average of
      US$1.3 billion to US$1.6 billion (Miralles-Wilhelm 2016), higher than the pre-
      vious estimate of US$1 billion a year (Ward and others 2010). The World Bank’s
      Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change estimated that the total costs of
      adapting infrastructure in Latin America could be around US$4 billion a year
      (World Bank 2010).4
         But given the avoided costs from negative impacts, investing in more robust
      infrastructure can have a high payoff. A study of Peru’s 2007 earthquake esti-
      mates that the country could have saved 27 times the reconditioning spent on
      water and sanitation infrastructure if the affected systems had had proper
      maintenance and been built using earthquake-resistant materials (Cannock and
      others 2011). Also in Peru, the benefits of making critical segments of the
      country’s road network flood resilient exceed the costs in almost all future



      Box 2.2  Nonprobabilistic Decision Making under Uncertainty Methodologies
      Although the scientific evidence for a changing climate is clear, uncertainty about the speed
      and intensity of these changes is high. In this context, it is impossible to define probabilities
      for future climate conditions or extreme climatic events.
          To account for these deep uncertainties, nonprobabilistic approaches are needed—often
      called decision making under uncertainty (DMU) methodologies. Rather than weighting
      futures probabilistically to define an optimal strategy, these methods seek to identify robust
      strategies—those that satisfy decision makers’ objectives in many plausible futures (Kalra and
      others 2014; Lempert and others 2013). These methods have been applied, for example, to
      define a robust portfolio of water reservoirs for implementing Lima’s long-term water resource
      plan (Kalra and others 2015). The basic steps include identifying all the possible conditions
      that could make a project fail and deciding whether these are reasonable scenarios to try
      and  protect against based on decision makers’ tolerance for risk, inputs from experts
      and  stakeholders on whether the scenarios are worth worrying about, and the costs of
      robust options.
          Such an approach can also help to define pathways that allow for flexibility and adjust-
      ment of the strategy once new information becomes available and future developments
      become more predictable. For example, for Lima, an adaptive portfolio of water reservoirs
      was identified, starting with no-regret reservoirs to be implemented in the near term
      (figure B2.2.1). In the medium term, reservoirs can be added depending on the feasibility of
      ­
      and need for more complicated projects. In the long term, decision makers can choose the
      reservoir combinations that meet future water demand.

scenarios (figure 2.6). Generally, however, benefits—like costs—are very loca-
tion specific and very difficult to estimate.
   Cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms and integrated planning frame-
works help make infrastructure sectors more prepared and responsive.
Effective solutions need to work across sectors and levels of governments to
align local plans with regional and national strategies. For example, after
Chile’s 2010 earthquake, the biggest challenge for water and sanitation sys-
tems was the absence of electricity. Chile’s experience shows that in addition
to improving the response capacity of individual water utilities, these utilities
need to be integrated in a regional, multisector contingency plan (Peña and
others 2012). Recent droughts in São Paulo have shown the need not only for
technological solutions, but also for assigning water rights in basins shared
among jurisdictions (Peña and others 2015).

 Note: The three figures show for critical segments of three major roads in Peru (Panamericana, Piura, and Carretera Central) the net present value
 of four possible interventions: more frequent maintenance, increasing redundancy (for all or just some routes), and flood proofing. The net
 present value of these interventions is estimated for hundreds of possible scenarios—depicted in the many horizontal bars—that explore
 uncertainties around possible future flooding, damage associated with this flooding, and time to rebuild. The net present value is calculated as
 the difference between the reduction in annual losses (including user costs and rehabilitation costs) due to intervention and the investment and
 maintenance costs of the intervention option.




                                              Resource management is also critical to improving resilience. Work done for this
                                           report argues that future water scarcity will be driven by water demand rather than
                                           climate-influenced water availability (Miralles-Wilhelm 2016). Similarly, energy
                                           efficiency and demand-side management in electricity will help reduce the need
                                           for more baseload power plants, all of which are heavily water dependent.

                                           Pressures Will Mount to Reduce Emissions from Infrastructure
                                           Infrastructure-related sectors will play an important role in achieving Latin
                                           America’s emission targets. Although the region accounts for just 11 percent of
                                           global emissions, significant emission reductions are needed to remain within the
                                           global 2°C warming target. Emissions in Latin America grew from 3.6 gigatons
                                           of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) in 1990 to 4.4 GtCO2e in 2012, with a
                                           doubling of emissions from electricity and transport and a 50 percent increase in
                                           “other energy,” more than offsetting an 18 percent decrease in emissions from
                                           land-use changes and forestry (figure 2.7).
                                              Among energy-related sectors, transport is the fastest growing contributor to
                                           emissions (figure 2.7). It is also a larger-than-average contributor: in 2012, trans-
                                           port accounted for 32 percent (compared with 23 percent globally) of energy-
                                           related emissions. Most Latin American countries saw rapid increases in emissions
                                           from both electricity and transport: in Brazil, both shot up more than 60 percent,
                                           while in Peru, emissions from electricity generation tripled and emissions from
                                           transport grew 80 percent (figure 2.8).
                                              Without action, emissions from infrastructure-related sectors are likely to
                                           increase further. According to the Global Energy Assessment (GEA) model

business-as-usual scenario with increased motorization and decreased reliance on
hydroelectricity would see energy-related emissions in the region more than
double between 2010 and 2050 (Vergara and others 2013).
   Mitigation options in energy-related sectors could reduce emissions consider-
ably. Estimates from the GEA model suggest that energy-focused mitigation
strategies in Latin America could cut annual emissions by up to 4.1 GtCO2e by
2050, reducing energy-related emissions to almost zero. Such savings would
require 60–80 percent of the primary energy mix to come from renewables,
75–100 percent of the electricity mix to come from low-carbon sources,
and further improvements in energy intensity (Vergara and others 2013).

      More generally, mitigation strategies involve action on three fronts: decarboniz-
      ing energy mixes, electrification (notably of transport), and increasing efficiency
      (Fay and others 2015).
          In transport, the main mitigation options include shifting to lower-carbon
      transport modes, switching to low-carbon fuels, improving vehicle and engine
      performance, and reducing the number of journeys and travel times. Some of the
      greatest gains could come from developing bus rapid transit (BRT) systems.
      These systems have mainstreamed bus-based mass transit by offering high capac-
      ity and good service at relatively low costs and have been developed in cities in
      Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Uruguay (World Bank 2013b).
      Important advances have also been made in upgrading and expanding rail-based
      systems, such as in the metropolitan areas of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. La Paz
      has developed a cable car to bring passengers from the suburbs to the city center.
      Given the relatively clean energy mix, switching to electric cars can reduce over-
      all emissions, as shown in Bogota (Delgado and others 2014). Similarly, enhanc-
      ing the quality and quantity of nonmotorized transport (such as cycling and
      walking) can cut emissions. For interregional or intercountry transport, the
      expansion of waterways, such as the Panama Canal, is another option for reduc-
      ing emissions (de Marucci 2012).
          Electricity decarbonization is possible through increased reliance on renew-
      able energy. However, expansion of hydroelectricity is limited by environmental
      and social concerns and climatic variability. Environmental concerns push for
      run-of-the-river plants, which means existing reservoirs are being used in excess,
      compromising the flexibility they bring to the overall energy system (Broad,
      de Moura, and Howells 2016). Thus, the region is losing storage capacity each
      year, because the number of hydro plants with large reservoir capacity remains
      constant but demand is increasing. Fortunately, the region has considerable
      potential in wind (especially in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Uruguay), geo-
      thermal (mostly in Andean countries), and solar (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and
      Peru have areas for large-scale electricity production using concentrated solar
      power plants). Equally important, the region has made good progress on improv-
      ing the business environment for investment in renewables—although it remains
      far from the good practice frontier, as demonstrated by the Readiness for
      Investment in Sustainable Energy Index (box 2.3).
          The region has significant potential for improved energy efficiency—which is
      critical not just to reduce emissions but also to reduce investment needs and local
      pollution. Latin America’s energy intensity is declining, but at a slower rate than
      in other regions (which, admittedly, have much more room for improvement)
      and not in all countries. Brazil has actually increased its energy intensity from 5.1
      megajoules per 2010 US$ in 1990 to 5.3 in 2012. Significant scope for further
      reducing energy intensity exists in transport, agriculture, industry, and commer-
      cial services. But significant improvements in regulations and policies—as well as
      their implementation—are needed (box 2.3).
          The question is whether Latin America’s power sector is ready for the kind
      of transformation and new business models that are emerging in advanced

Box 2.3  The Region Is Improving Its Business Environment for Renewable Energy
Investments, although It Remains Far from the Good Practice Frontier
The Readiness for Investment in Sustainable Energy Index (RISE)—a suite of indicators that
assesses the legal and regulatory environment for investment in sustainable energy, including
renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy access—gives Latin America a 52 percent
score (“average/to be improved”) for renewable energy and 41 percent for energy efficiency.
This score is better than Sub-Saharan Africa’s score but below other developing regions, espe-
cially for energy efficiency. The index evaluates whether a region has introduced key measures
on planning, policies and regulation, and administrative efficiency, and assesses counterparty
risk and the existence of carbon pricing and monitoring.
    In its first global rollout (2015), RISE covered 14 Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Peru, and República Bolivariana de Venezuela. Most of these countries have intro-
duced laws, regulations, targets, and action plans to promote renewable energy development
(Haiti and República Bolivariana de Venezuela are exceptions). Most have also developed
resource mappings and integrated renewable energy into traditional expansion planning.
But it is in the details of regulations, operational rules, and planning where countries still need
progress. For example, few countries in the region consider renewable energy scale-up in their
transmission planning, and few produce strategic plans or provide zoning guidance on siting,
which is essential to investors.
    Most countries also need to make regulatory and policy incentives more efficient and
effective and improve the creditworthiness of their utilities to make them more attractive to
potential investors. Finally, credit enhancement and risk-mitigation instruments—such as let-
ters of credit, escrow accounts, and payment guarantees—are needed to attract private invest-
ment in renewable energy, but few governments in the sample are able to offer such
incentives.
    A few countries in the region have developed policies, regulations, and institutions to
boost energy efficiency (Mexico, and to a lesser extent Brazil and Colombia). But implementa-
tion has been weak, and most has occurred in the context of crises and deficits in energy sup-
plies. In addition, fossil fuel subsidies remain high in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,
Ecuador, and República Bolivariana de Venezuela.

medium-size and large countries show that the region’s power sector can
embrace and manage change. The region has some of the most sophisticated
power sectors among developing regions and is largely prepared to confront
some of the challenges facing 21st-century utilities. For example, Latin America
pioneered the use of competitive procurement for renewables, significantly and
sustainably scaling up wind and solar generation.
   These new technologies and a potential transformation of the business model
could mean that the clean way forward is the cheapest. Modeling done for this
report finds that South America would need to invest US$23 billion to US$24
billion a year in additional generation capacity under a business-as-usual scenario
or even under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that countries in
the region offered at the 2016 Paris Climate Conference (COP21) (table 2.7).
But under a disruption scenario that compares with the NDCs in terms of large-
scale renewable energy but makes much greater use of new technology for smart
grids, decentralized generation, and energy efficiency by both grids and end users,
costs could drop to US$8.4 billion a year between now and 2031. Leapfrogging,
perhaps not surprisingly, could save the region a lot of money.
   But a number of issues would need to be tackled for this transformation to
happen. Most utilities in the region lack the skills to interact with customers
more actively—a challenge given the role that utilities must play in imple-
menting integrated planning, fostering energy efficiency, helping clients man-
age load, and working with end users to scale up distributed generation.
Further, the transformation needed will be driven by changes in policies and
regulations. Policy makers will need to develop national energy goals and policy
tools, while regulators must provide utilities with incentives to engage “beyond
the meter”—moving away from pure concepts of “return on assets” and

      “revenues coupled to sales” to a new approach that compensates utilities for a
      broader set of services provided to clients.
         More generally, and beyond the electricity sector, long-term planning is critical
      to greening the region’s infrastructure. The optimal strategy and mix of abate-
      ment options depend on the time horizon and end goal. An example from Brazil
      shows how the planning horizon will affect what the “right” strategy looks like
      (figure 2.9). A strategy for 2020 makes more use of measures that are cheap and
      quick to implement, such as new processes and improvements in refineries.
      Measures for 2030 are costlier but have much larger abatement potential in the
      long term, such as building a new metro system. When designing an emissions
      reduction plan, costs, time to implement, and overall emissions reduction poten-
      tial all need to be considered. Options in transport that take time to reach their
      full potential, but are required to reach long-term goals, need to get started early.


      Urbanization and Changing Socioeconomics Are Complicating Matters
      Latin America is highly urban, yet its cities are still seeing growth and transfor-
      mation, with infrastructure both leading and following these changes.5
      Urbanization has been one of the drivers of increased access to infrastructure
      services, making it easier to achieve economies of scale. But these savings depend
      on the density of cities: encouraging compact development instead of sprawl can
      reduce public infrastructure and service costs by 10–40 percent (Litman 2015;
      Marulanda and others 2015). There is a limit to the gains from densification,
      however, as the limits of bulk infrastructure can be reached above a certain
      threshold of density (Libertun de Guren and Guerrero Compéan 2016).

    But housing, urban, and infrastructure policies are encouraging Latin America
cities to expand at the periphery, with serious implications for infrastructure
service costs. The region’s built-up areas have expanded rapidly in recent decades.
If expansion patterns continue unchanged, built-up urban areas will double in
the region by 2035. Density has declined in Brasilia, Buenos Aires, La Paz,
Montevideo, and Santiago. This increase in sprawl is largely policy driven: in
Buenos Aires, for example, transport, land use, and housing policies are driving
factors of low density growth in the periphery (Inostroza, Baur, and Csaplovics
2010). And while in Mexico only 14 percent of cities over 100,000 inhabitants
“sprawled” between 1990 and 2010, most still have relatively low population
densities, with immediate implications for infrastructure investment needs.
The World Bank’s Mexico Urbanization Review found that denser urbanization
would reduce infrastructure investment and maintenance costs by 41 percent in
Merida and 67 percent in Los Cabos compared to business-as-usual urbanization
(Kim and Zangerling 2016).
    In addition, some 25 percent of Latin America’s city dwellers are believed to
be living in slums (UN-Habitat 2013), many in areas not suitable for residential
construction. Slums are often located in flood-prone or environmentally pro-
tected areas that put slum dwellers at high risk of natural disasters or create
hazards for others (for example, when slums are in areas that threaten urban
watersheds, as in Curitiba). Combined with disorderly and dense occupation that
hinders work on access roads or water, sewerage, or drainage work, this compli-
cates infrastructure provision and raises the costs. As a result, estimates are that
upgrading a slum costs two to eight times more than regular land development
(Abiko and others 2007). The implications are serious for infrastructure invest-
ment costs given that infrastructure typically represents some 70 percent of slum
upgrading costs (Marulanda and others 2015).
    What about changing socioeconomics? Latin America’s middle class grew by
about 50 percent during the boom years of 2003–09 (Ferreira and others 2012)
reaching about 30 percent of the population just as the share of the population
living in poverty fell by an equivalent amount. The vast majority of this middle
class, as well as those approaching middle-class status, have access to electricity.
Most also have access to water, while relatively few have access to sanitation
(figure 2.10). Most reside in urban areas where they presumably have access to
paved roads and some type of public transportation.
    But this growing middle and near-middle class is far from being a saturated
market in terms of consumer durables. A small share of the upper income deciles
own the full suite of consumer durables (refrigerators, washing machines, air
conditioners, computers, cars) that characterize the middle classes in high-
income countries and drives their energy consumption and demand for infra-
structure services: on average, some 90 percent own refrigerators, though that
share drops rapidly with other durables (70–80 percent for washing machines,
and 40 percent for cars) and for the near-middle class decile (figure 2.11).
    Potentially facilitating access to durables is the boom in consumer credit
that occurred in the last decade in Latin America, increasing from 9 percent

      policy makers to complain that the region’s financial system has been concen-
      trating too much on financing consumption at the expense of production
      (de la Torre, Ize, and Schmukler 2012), is expected to continue due to a
      combination of increased access to banking and rapid expansion of credit
      cards and store cards. Three Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile, and
      Colombia) are ranked in the top 10 for the fastest growth in card lending
      debt since 2008. Store cards (retailer credit) are a relatively new phenome-
      non that is taking off quickly given its greater accessibility to lower-middle-
      class and poorer households. By one account, Brazilian families own some
      181 million store cards, while Mexican families have 9 million (Capizzani,
      Ramírez Huerta, and Rocha e Oliveira 2012).

consumption, do not increase one-to-one with income. Instead, it is generally
believed that at low levels of income, increases in income have limited impact
as credit-constrained households use the extra cash on basics. But as income
rises, purchases of durables increase rapidly—especially if credit constraints are
removed (Gertler and others 2016). Data from Latin America suggest that this
is true for the poorest households, which exhibit low income elasticity for con-
sumer durables, but that consumer behavior varies both across income groups
and type of durables. Still, growth in energy demand from first-time purchases
of consumer durables could have significant impacts on overall energy demand
in a way that may not be sufficiently taken into account in traditional energy
forecasts.
    At the same time, most remaining basic access challenges in water and elec-
tricity are now concentrated in the poorest income decile. Chances are that these
households are located in hard-to-reach areas—remote rural locations or difficult

      implication is that closing the remaining access gap could be more challenging

CHAPTER 3




The Road Ahead: Spending Better
to Meet “Real” Infrastructure Needs




Chapter 1 started by discussing Latin America’s infrastructure investment needs.
Needs are usually defined based on the historical relationship between income
and infrastructure growth. So let us look at the region’s road ahead if countries
maintain the historical link between infrastructure access and income growth,
assuming a high-growth scenario similar to the 2002–12 one—but go a step
further, using decile-specific access rates to see how different income groups
are likely to fare given that, in most countries, public policies favor richer
households.
   The results are sobering. If the road ahead is anything like the one behind, it
will take the region between 10 and 50 years to achieve universal coverage in
electricity, up to 90 years for water, and a staggering 200 years for sanitation (Fay
and Straub 2016). The value of the elasticity of access with respect to income
plays a crucial role here. Consider the three countries with about 50 percent
coverage rates for water at the bottom of the income distribution—Bolivia, the
Dominican Republic, and Peru. The fact that Peru is much better than Bolivia in
translating income growth into improved access (as shown by their respective
elasticities of 0.18 and 0.08) means that Peru is likely to achieve full coverage for
the poorest decile in half the time (43 years as opposed to 96; admittedly still a
very long time).
   But these are constrained elasticities, capturing a combination of constrained
demand (largely due to lack of income) and constrained supply (due to limited or
inefficient public investments). It is probably more useful to think of the potential
margin of adjustment to tackle the last-mile challenge as being the improvement
in the elasticity that could be achieved through additional or more efficient
investment. For example, improving spending to increase the income elasticity
to 0.2 (that is, above the current regional best performer) would allow the nine
best-performing countries to connect all the households in the first decile to water
in less than 21 years. An even higher elasticity of 0.5 would allow all countries
except El Salvador to complete that task in 16 years or less.

90	                              The Road Ahead: Spending Better to Meet “Real” Infrastructure Needs


         So what to do? Are we back to the starting point of the report, with estimates
      of investment needs that argue for Latin America to spend a lot more than it
      does? More money would make things easier. But is that an option?
         The discussion of fiscal space in chapter 2 makes it abundantly clear that gov-
      ernments in the region have limited room to increase public investments. Over the
      past 16 years, total public investment has been 3.1–4.6 percent of gross domestic
      product (GDP). Today it is about 3.4 percent. On average, only about a third of
                  investment goes to infrastructure. So, going forward, it is unlikely that
      this public ­
      public investment in infrastructure will be much above 1.0–1.5 percent of GDP.
         As for public-private partnerships (PPPs), the discussion in chapter 1 showed
      that while PPPs account for about 40 percent of Latin America’s infrastructure
      investments, they depend heavily on government support: about one-third of
      their financing comes from public sources, and about one-half of all deals receive
      some type of government guarantee. In other words, constrained public finance
      also means constrained private finance for infrastructure. Although the region has
      had a few extraordinary years, private participation in infrastructure has usually
      hovered between 0.5 and 1.0 percent of GDP.
         So at the most, the region is unlikely to see investments in infrastructure from
      traditional sources exceed 1.5–2.5 percent of GDP in the near future. This means
      that the main way forward, at least in the short to medium term, is to make
      scarce resources stretch further and improve the access of public service provid-
      ers to commercial finance. That can be done by reducing the tab associated with
      investment spending “needs” by focusing on priorities, managing demand, reduc-
      ing costs, and improving public spending (and public enterprise) efficiency more
      generally. Fortunately, as noted throughout this report, Latin America has plenty
      of scope to do this.


      Focusing on Priorities—Setting the Right Goals Is Essential
      There is no such thing as an absolute investment need. The amount of money
      needed for Latin American infrastructure depends on the goals that are set and
      on how efficient investors are at achieving them. So, a sensible approach to defin-
      ing infrastructure investment needs must start by defining goals—in terms of the
      access, quality, affordability, sustainability, and inclusiveness of infrastructure
      services that are needed to achieve the region’s development ambition.
         As such, the received wisdom that Latin America “needs” to spend 4–5 percent
      of GDP on infrastructure is not helpful. In fact, it is outright distracting. Instead,
      countries should conduct their own analyses to define their goals and what it
      would take to achieve them. Unfortunately, few countries in the region have
      developed clear goals—and even fewer have priced them or examined whether
      they have the resources or institutions to develop strategic plans, as opposed to
      wish lists.
         Yet doing so would be highly instructive. Take water and sanitation. A careful
      analysis of water and investment needs done at the World Bank (Hutton and
      Varughese 2016) started by defining two possible goals. One was the Millennium

Development Goal (MDG) of achieving universal access to basic water, sanita-
tion, and hygiene by 2030; the other was the much more ambitious Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) of achieving universal access to safely managed water
and sanitation services by 2030.
    The difference in ambition between these two goals has striking implications
for their cost. Providing basic access to everyone in the region would cost a mere
0.05 percent of GDP a year through 2030; achieving universal access to safely
managed water and sanitation would cost five times more, or about 0.25 percent
of GDP. (This 0.25 percent happens to be what Latin America currently spends
on water and sanitation. As such, the region should be able to achieve ambitious
goals without necessarily increasing capital spending.)
    How the region goes about pursuing this goal will make a big difference.
There is lots of uncertainty in these kinds of estimates—about population, level
of urbanization, and costs. And there are choices, some to do with the analysis
(what discount rate to use?) and some to do with the strategy, notably the path
chosen to get there. The 0.25 percent of GDP assumes that about half of house-
holds will go straight to a higher level of service and half will first pass through
basic water and unimproved sanitation. If all first go through the low-cost tech-
nology and later upgrade, overall costs would be higher. Thus, analysis provides
low and high estimates: a low discount rate and a population that immediately
obtains the higher level of services results in an estimated 0.1 percent of GDP a
year “investment need,” while the higher discount rate and indirect path to the
SDG would raise the estimated cost to some 0.4 percent of GDP.
    Similarly, and as discussed in the section on climate change, investment
“needs” for electricity depend on the goals set and the strategy adopted to
achieve them. According to modeling done for this study, a business-as-usual
investment path that follows South America countries’ master plans, with
demand growing as in recent years and an unchanged climate, would entail
annual investments of US$23 billion to US$24 billion a year (Broad, de Moura,
and Howells 2016). A scenario with much greater penetration of renewables
would be somewhat more expensive at US$25 billion to US$26 billion per year.
But an ambitious “disruptive scenario” that adopts smart grids, smart metering
(and hence effective demand-side management), and ambitious penetration of
renewables would cost US$8 billion to US$9 billion a year. This does not
include the cost of demand-side management programs, so the final tab would
be higher—but the point remains that how the region goes about implementing
its energy strategy will have a significant impact on how much is needed.
    Interestingly, these numbers are well within the range of what the region has
been spending on energy (0.75–1.00 percent of GDP), even when adding the
cost of expanding access to electricity and modern cooking fuels: expressed as a
percentage of South America’s current GDP, the disruptive scenario would
amount to 0.2 percent of GDP (not counting demand-side management invest-
ments) and the business-as-usual scenario, 0.6 percent. In other words, an ambi-
tious, clean, and equitable energy goal, well conceived and delivered, is achievable
within the current spending envelope.

          That leaves transport, which is far more complicated. First, what goals should
      be set? There must be at least three: one for urban transport, one for rural trans-
      port, and one for freight. But how to set them? Unlike for water, sanitation,
      electricity, or modern cooking fuels, there can be no presumption that universal
      access should be the goal for any of these. Nor is it even clear what universal
      access would mean for urban, rural, or freight transport. Further, there is no good
      database on any of these three dimensions to allow us to estimate how far the
      region is from whatever goals are set.
          As such, every country will need to define its transport goals and develop a
      master plan. The few master plans that exist tend to be wish lists and overly
      focused on infrastructure as opposed to services. Good roads, well-maintained
      rail tracks, modern airports, and dredged waterways are important, but competi-
      tive, well-priced, and well-regulated trucking, bus, rail, and aviation companies
      and good multimodal integration are at least as critical. Good transport infra-
      structure is expensive—so a focus on the service side and on spending efficiency
      is essential. And as the section on spending efficiency showed, transport has mas-
      sive potential for increased efficiency.
          Infrastructure goals are best defined in terms of the service needed—say,
      mobility—rather than the input required—say, kilometers of roads. This approach
      opens up the possibility of managing demand to reduce the cost of satisfying this
      demand. Thus, as discussed earlier, denser cities enhance mobility at much lower
      cost. Rough estimates are that encouraging compact development instead of
      sprawl can reduce overall infrastructure construction and service costs by
      10–40 percent (Marulanda and others 2015).
          Much can be achieved through demand-side management. The discussion
      on investment “needs” in energy shows that demand-side management
      largely determines how much investment will really be needed—and
      “negawatts” (energy saved from energy efficiency and demand-side manage-
      ment efforts) are almost always cheaper than megawatts. And here pricing
      services adequately has a double-whammy effect: it encourages efficient use
      by consumers (to buy more fuel-efficient cars, use public transportation,
      turn off lights, buy energy-efficient appliances, fix leaking faucets, and so
      on), and generates resources, thereby reducing the burden on taxpayers and
      scarce public funds.


      Improving Utility Performance and Deploying Public and
      Concessional Finance Where It Is Truly Needed
      Pricing services appropriately and running utilities efficiently also makes it pos-
      sible for them to attract private financing. In 2016, only 20 percent of the Latin
      American water utilities included in the International Benchmarking Network
      for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) database covered their operations
      and maintenance costs and generated enough of a surplus to mobilize com-
      mercial borrowing (assumed to be cash revenues exceeding costs by at least
      20 percent). This means that 80 percent of utilities would have difficulties

mobilizing commercial financing unless they implement significant reforms to
improve cost recovery.
    But if few can attract commercial financing now, the potential for improvement
is significant. Using this same dataset, the average level of reported non-revenue
water (water that is delivered into a network but “lost” before it reaches a legiti-
mate consumer) was 31 percent. But there were significant variations in perfor-
mance: the top 10 percent of performers achieved nonrevenue water levels of
15 percent, while the level among the lowest decile was 57 percent. In terms of
collection efficiency, the average for the dataset was 75 percent of the amount
billed, whereas the average in the top decile was 100 percent and in the lowest
decile, 46 percent. Assuming that utilities could achieve the performance of utili-
ties in the top decile in terms of collection efficiency (Step 1 in figure 3.1), that
modest nonlabor efficiency gains (predominantly energy) of 15 percent can be
made (Step 2), that leakage levels could be reduced to 25 percent (realistic and
less than the top decile), and that water saved from leaks can be sold at the prevail-
ing average tariff (Step 3), then 65 percent of the region’s utilities in the IBNET
sample could create sufficient surplus to mobilize commercial borrowing.1
    The implication is that reasonable progress in efficient management could
more than triple the number of water utilities with potential access to commer-
cial financing. In this simplified model (up to Step 3), the financial improve-
ments are achieved at current tariff levels. If the utility can enhance its revenue
stream from tariffs, taxes, or a mix of the two (Step 4), then 82 percent of

                   utilities would achieve the 120 percent cost recovery level. Mobilizing funds up
                   front to deliver such efficiency gains would be needed, as would capacity build-
                   ing. But if these cash surpluses could be maintained or increased over the long
                   term through good policies, governance, and incentives, the ability to mobilize
                   commercial financing starts to look like a distinct possibility. This could well lead
                   to a virtuous circle: the lure of external financing—and the scrutiny of external
                   investors—would motivate utilities to be efficient, and the additional financing
                   would then enable them to invest and provide a service good enough that con-
                   sumers would be willing to pay for it.

                   Commercial Financing and the Importance of Making Judicious Use of
                   Public Resources
                   Increased reliance on commercial financing, where possible and appropriate,
                   along with the judicious use of public and concessional resources, is one of the
                   essential ways through which Latin American countries can “spend better.” To do
                   so, the World Bank is recommending a simple sequential decision-making frame-
                   work (figure 3.2).
                       The starting point of this approach is that any investment project or pro-
                   gram that can be financed on commercial terms while remaining affordable
                   and offering value for money, should be.2 Where commercial financing is not
                   cost effective or viable because of perceived risks or market failures, efforts
                   should focus on addressing these market failures through upstream reforms to
                   strengthen country and sector policies, regulations, and institutions or targeted
                   public interventions (for example, targeted subsidies or complementary public

investments such as transmission lines). Where risks remain high and raise the
cost of commercial capital beyond that afforded by project or corporate rev-
enue generation, it may still be possible to cost-effectively use risk-sharing
instruments backed by public or concessional finance to lower the cost of
commercial capital. If commercial financing is still not viable or cost effective,
then public and concessional resources are the likely solution.
   Importantly, this framework can only be applied to services that can be
charged to users, as user fees are what creates the basis for commercial financ-
ing options beyond the use of general taxes.3 A very rough estimate by the
World Bank estimates that perhaps up to 50 percent of infrastructure invest-
ment needs could theoretically be financed on a commercial basis, based on the
feasibility and desirability of different subsectors to generate user fees.
Feasibility depends on the ability to tie a service to an individual user (easier
for electricity than for rural roads), whereas desirability will vary depending on
externalities, the need for demand-side management, and social or political
economy considerations. And of course, willingness to pay will also matter for
cost recovery—users are more likely to accept charges for good quality services
and rates perceived to be fair.
   Equity and poverty concerns are not at odds with reliance on commercial
financing, even as they are often invoked in arguments against full cost recovery
for basic services such as water and sanitation, electricity, public transport, and
modern cooking fuels. The needs of the poor are in fact typically best served by
a combination of cost-recovery tariffs and targeted subsidies and payments
schemes adapted to the needs of the poor. Most of the wealthier Latin American
countries have well-developed social registries and safety nets (for example,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico) but the targeting is likely to be a challenge for
countries without such systems. Still, efforts at targeting the poor are likely to
help them more than underfunded, low-cost recovery utilities unable to expand
coverage or provide quality service.
   Nevertheless, it may be difficult to reconcile the higher return expectations of
commercial financing requirements with affordability concerns. This is particu-
larly true in island states where the cost of infrastructure service provision such
as power generation may already be high for reasons of economic geography. It is
also an issue for countries and sectors with low access rates where the consumer
base is too small to bear the cost of service expansion (hence prohibiting full cost
pricing). Fortunately, this is only a challenge in a few countries in the region (for
example, Haiti) and sectors with low coverage (wastewater treatment and
modern cooking fuels). In such cases, the solution typically involves a blend of
financing tools—commercial, public, and concessionary—to match the condi-
tions that the investments face.
   Applying this framework to judiciously deploy scarce public and concessional
resources and ensuring commercial financing provides value for money is not
always simple. It implies carefully weighing the trade-offs between the financing
of infrastructure on the back of government taxes versus commercial financ-
ing backed by the securitization of user fees. While public and concessional

      financing appears cheaper than commercial sources of finance, it is drawn from
      a pool of scarce resources whose opportunity cost should be carefully considered
      with each investment decision. As for commercial capital (which includes the
      cost of any guarantee, off-take agreements, and any government-backed credit
      agreement), its higher cost must be weighed against potential efficiency gains in
      the provision of the asset.

      Corporatization and the Importance of Improving the Performance of
      Utilities—Public and Private
      So how to obtain such efficiency improvements? Some countries and sectors
      have turned to the private sector for service delivery, with the result that the
      number of connections served via private participation in infrastructure (PPI)
      increased from 11 percent in 1995 to around 60 percent by 2006 for electricity
      (but are still only 8 percent for water).4 A review of more than 250 electricity
      distribution companies and more than 1,700 water and sanitation utilities in
      Latin America found that on average, private utilities outperform public ones,
      although there are good and bad performers in both groups (the top 10 per-
      cent of public utilities outperform the average private utility) (Andrés,
      Schwartz, and Guasch 2013). The conclusion of the review was that, when care-
      fully designed and implemented, private participation in service provision improves
      sector performance—specifically labor productivity, efficiency, and service
      quality.
          The caveat about careful design and implementation is important. As Andrés,
      Schwartz, and Guasch (2013) point out, improving sector performance demands
      that key determinants such as ownership structure, regulatory governance, and
      corporate governance be addressed strategically, not in isolation. Private manage-
      ment or ownership of a utility is no silver bullet—private participation is unlikely
      to yield the desired efficiency gains in the absence of some type of market test—
      and Latin America is rife with examples of costly and failed PPPs. Similar experi-
      ences have led Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
      (OECD) countries to adopt a number of principles aiming to ensure affordabil-
      ity, value for money, and transparency.5
          A companion report on PPPs in Latin America (Garcia-Kilroy and Rudolph
      2017) finds that the region has significant potential to increase PPPs but insists on
      the fact that PPPs are not a silver bullet. Even in advanced economies with success-
      ful programs, PPPs seldom exceed 10–15 percent of total infrastructure finance.
      PPPs should not be used as an off-balance sheet financing instrument to bypass
      fiscal constraints. Instead, the rationale for PPPs should be to achieve value for
      money for the government. Finally, effective PPPs require sophisticated institutions
      to implement them as well as a minimum level of financial sector development.
          The report argues that achieving Latin America’s potential in terms of PPPs
      will require tackling the following challenges:

      •	 Often weak underpinnings. This includes: (1) PPP frameworks, where they exist,
         are still facing important challenges on issues such as quality project selection

   and structuring, risk allocation between the public and the private sector, and
   procurement procedures; (2) project finance skills, which are at the core of PPP
   financing, are underdeveloped among banks, and financial regulations seldom
   acknowledge the difference with corporate lending; (3) depth and sophistica-
   tion of local financial markets (banks or capital markets), whose size and sophis-
   tication are insufficient to address financing gaps or facilitate adequate risk
   sharing between government and other stakeholders.
•	 Low participation of foreign sponsors and financiers who can provide volume,
   competition, and knowledge transfer.
•	 A lack of consensus among public and private sector stakeholders around PPP
   frameworks and programs, which is critical to reach the necessary trust among
   the different parties.

   The report offers a useful reminder that PPP programs are not right for all
countries. Only large and medium-size countries with a minimum threshold of
financial development would be able to afford PPP programs in local currency.
For smaller countries, PPPs could be a relevant source of financing for select
signature projects with revenues in dollars, but most would need concessional
financing or guarantees from multilateral development finance institutions
(DFIs) to access international capital. The experience of the region has been of a
small presence of multilateral DFIs. As to domestic DFIs that have been active
financiers of infrastructure, they have tended to prioritize direct lending instead
of assuming a catalytic role to mobilize private financing.
   But whether utilities and service providers are public, private, or a mix, they
need to be run as corporatized entities and regulated by independent regulatory
agencies that are transparent, accountable, and free of political interference.
Key findings and conclusions of the review of Latin America’s electricity distribu-
tion companies and water and sanitation utilities (Andrés, Schwartz, and Guasch
2013) include the following:

•	 The presence of a regulatory agency significantly improves sector performance,
   raises labor productivity and cost recovery, and reduces operational expenses
   and distribution losses.
•	 Improving sector performance demands that key determinants—such as
   ownership structure, regulatory governance, and corporate governance—be
   addressed strategically, not in isolation. Private management or ownership of
   a utility is no silver bullet.
•	 For state-owned enterprises (SOEs), strong accountability is central to improv-
   ing performance. Corporate governance standards (which are the norm for
   privatized or privately managed utilities), performance orientation, and pro-
   fessional management were found to be the most important determinants of
   performance. More generally, best practices for any utility or corporatized ser-
   vice provider include an independent, performance-driven board; a corporate
   structure that prevents political interference; a professional staff; clear disclo-
   sure policies; and mechanisms to evaluate and reward performance.

      •	 Reform success requires addressing the technical and financial dimensions of
         the reform (concession laws and contracts that clearly assign and mitigate risks,
         discourage opportunistic bidding and renegotiations, and are embedded in
         transparent and predictable regulatory systems that promote efficiency and
         accountability and address social concerns).
      •	 Reform success also necessitates addressing legitimate social concerns and per-
         ceptions. Reversal of policies can be triggered by popular discontent associated
         with a failure to help those most affected (for example, through targeted subsi-
         dies to protect the poor against necessary tariff hikes or job search assistance for
         redundant employees of a utility) but also by a failure to communicate success.

         There are many examples of utilities and other service providers that have
      turned around and become good performers—but this often requires a combina-
      tion of a catalytic event that creates a space for reform and savvy political and
      technical leaders that seize the opportunity to formulate a mutually beneficial
      partnership. Together they must help shape networks and alliances for change
      and start to embed the reform legacy. But success is only possible if the balance
      of political economy pay-offs remains in favor of reform, and, once achieved, in
      favor of sustained good service, even as the attractions of predation on the utility
      increase. Experience points to steps reformers can take to ensure lasting success
      (box 3.1). And while these findings were derived in the context of an analysis of
      utilities, they apply equally well to any infrastructure service provider.




      Box 3.1  The Political Economy of Reform: Conditions for Change
      A review of successful water sector reforms found that building reform momentum and sus-
      taining service required action on three interrelated fronts, including the following:

      •	 Building and strengthening internal capacity and culture: The technocratic and
         managerial skills that helped launch the reforms were then used to build strong staff and
         ­
         managers. Other managerial techniques—like performance-based pay, inclusive corpo-
         rate  strategic planning, and general transparency—also helped build and strengthen
         performance-based cultures. Utility leaders built internal capabilities and cultures that
         ­
         made the utility successful and later on helped to sustain reforms. A professional culture
         provided a barrier against predation on the utility since, being anathema to professional
         culture, the organization itself would fight against it. Grooming future leaders and promot-
         ing training and development were particularly important in the cases studied. This is an
         indication that leadership is a critical variable, not solely at the outset of reforms, but
         throughout the life of a successful utility, particularly in a precarious macropolitical
         economy context. By creating a deep management bench, a utility reduces the risk that
         ­
         losing a  leader will undo its success. A performance-based corporate culture, with an
         emphasis  on  transparency, also promoted reform momentum and reform resilience.
                                                                                   box continues next page

Box 3.1  The Political Economy of Reform: Conditions for Change (continued)

   A  performance-based pay system—based on annual reviews against performance
   ­
   indicators derived from the utility’s overall mission, and well-defined job descriptions for
   staff—is important in many of the case utilities. Many utilities also involve all staff in strate-
   gic planning. This sets the scene for establishing ownership of the institution, with staff at
   all levels able to understand, able to operationalize, and able to articulate the approach
   taken by the management.
•	 Forging and embedding alliances with external stakeholders: Alliances with customers,
   the government, development partners, and other stakeholders were used to build momen-
   tum for reform and help sustain it. Utility leaders demonstrated a high degree of political
   savvy, understanding of the political and wider sociocultural context, and the ability to
   navigate competing interests in an unsettled governance and institutional environment.
   ­
   Alliances constructed in the momentum phase were instrumental in maintaining reforms
   later.
•	 Creating and strengthening formal rules and structures (institutions): In isolation,
   ­formal rules and structures are an inadequate guarantee of sustained success. “Independent”
    boards, for example, are routinely replaced by politicians, sometimes in breach of company
    law. “Independent” regulators may be reluctant to approve tariff increases. But when cou-
    pled with professionally capable organizations embedded in a web of stakeholder alliances,
    formal regulatory and governance structures can contribute to the sustainability of reforms.

Improving Public Investment Management and Spending Efficiency
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), reducing inefficiencies in
developing countries’ public investment (including but not limited to infrastruc-
ture) by 2030 would provide the same boost to capital stock as increasing gov-
ernment investment by 5 percentage points of GDP in emerging economies and
by 14 percentage points of GDP in low-income countries (IMF 2014). These
types of estimates are fairly heroic, but they do suggest that public investment
efficiency gains can have more than microlevel effects. In addition, more efficient
countries are likely to be more attractive to investors interested in PPPs. In fact,
evidence suggests that PPI flows are sensitive to the investment climate—more
so than direct foreign investment in general (Araya, Schwartz, and Andrés 2013).
   There are many ways to improve public investment efficiency. In order of
importance, these include the following:
   Build effective public sector institutions with clear mandates. A critical
factor in a country’s ability to spend efficiently on well-identified priorities
is the strength of its institutions (Andrés, Biller, and Dappe 2016). Where
decision makers ignore the results of prioritization exercises, or where regu-
latory institutions cannot weigh in with checks and balances to block ques-
tionable projects, even the best methodologies will be of little use. So a
priority for infrastructure in the region is to strengthen the institutions and

       systems relevant to transport, electricity, and water and sanitation invest-
       ments as follows:

       •	 Central government institutions, such as a ministry of finance or planning,
          need to take responsibility for facilitating an overall infrastructure strategy that
          is based on sound analysis, prioritization, and political mandate.
       •	 Sector institutions must have the capacity to identify, prioritize, and imple-
          ment projects according to politically endorsed sector priorities and visions.
       •	 Major administrative systems such as planning procedures, budgeting rules,
          treasury operations, procurement procedures, human resources, and safeguard
          systems must be aligned with the needs of capital investment projects (rather
          than being narrowly focused on controlling cash expenditures) to ensure effi-
          ciency, effectiveness, and transparency around investment.

          Such public sector capacities are critical to enable the development of an
       overall national investment plan, a politically sanctioned short list of projects, and
       an overall policy on how to use private sector expertise and innovation in the
       development of the national infrastructure framework. Infrastructure Australia
       offers an interesting example of such an approach (box 3.2).

       •	 Include multiyear budgeting in project selection and budgeting. This ensures
          resources are available for operations and maintenance, donor-funded projects
          are included in the budget, and that the public has access to key fiscal
          information.
       •	 Allow for project scrutiny by the legislature and public. Greater transparency
          regarding the key feasibility, cost/benefit analysis, and tendering and contract
          documents, as well as the use of independent evaluators, can hamper pork bar-
          rel politics. Audit and evaluation should include ex-post evaluation and exter-
          nal audits, as well as, importantly, the existence of an asset register or inventory
          of public property. Findings should be made public.
       •	 Ensure budgetary rules work to strengthen good project execution, rather than
          just control spending. Government agencies should be allowed to carry over
          project funds from year to year. This would help reduce pressures to inap-
          propriately expedite procurement and address the fact that the dry season,
          which is the optimal time for most public works, typically spans two fiscal
          years. Budgeting funds to investment programs in large blocks also strength-
          ens good capital management as it allows agencies to switch funds from
          projects that are going slowly to those that are ahead of schedule or are
          more pressing. Portfolio budgeting also prevents the private contractors
          from knowing what the government expects to pay for a contract, thereby
          turning it into a bid floor.
       •	 Use objective criteria and analysis to help decision makers prioritize among the
          multiplicity of projects across all sectors. Unfortunately, Latin American govern-
          ments seldom have the resources and data to do a full-fledged analysis, but

   multicriteria analysis can be used with some basic project appraisal data to
   rank a multitude of projects (see Marcelo and others 2016; and Andrés, Biller,

   criteria, weighting, and sensitivity analysis are decided in advance and the anal-
   ysis is made public and open to third-party review (Marcelo and others 2016).
   Adequate social and environmental risk management is also critical to
   managing costs, ensuring popular support, and ensuring the likelihood of a
   pro­ject’s  success.



Box 3.2  Assessing Needs and Proposing a Pipeline—The Case of Infrastructure
Australia
In 2008, in response to inadequate coordination in infrastructure planning, the Australian
government created Infrastructure Australia, an independent statutory body, whose role is to
provide independent research and advice to all levels of government as well as to investors
and owners of infrastructure on the projects and reforms Australia needs to fill the infrastruc-
ture gap. Its responsibilities include auditing the country’s infrastructure needs and perfor-
mance and developing a rolling 15-year infrastructure plan that identifies Australia’s national
and state-level infrastructure priorities in transport, including energy, telecommunications,
and water. Implementation of the plan requires that the federal government and/or the
subnational governments subsequently make it official policy.
­
    Infrastructure Australia is tasked with identifying Australia’s long-term infrastructure
needs through an infrastructure audit. This audit is based on an analysis of drivers of infrastruc-
ture demand, such as population and economic growth, and looks out to 2031. It has served
as a key input to Australia’s current Infrastructure Plan, which contains a package of reforms
regarding how infrastructure is financed, delivered, and used.
    The strategy developed in the plan considers a wide range of options and instruments,
including institutional and regulatory reforms, as well as investments. The longer-term view
helped move beyond the more common project-centered approach and enabled a more inte-
grated view of how infrastructure across various sectors can contribute to the country’s
development. Infrastructure Australia then developed an Infrastructure Priority List of initia-
tives and projects in collaboration with state and territory governments and industry that con-
siders three dimensions: strategic fit; economic, social, and environmental value; and ­ability to
deliver.
    The plan identified a number of complex reforms that could deliver significant productivity
benefits country wide but which were politically challenging. To overcome this, Infrastructure
Australia proposed a three-tiered approach that called on the national government to lever-
age its investment in infrastructure to encourage state and local governments to implement
the reforms identified in the plan. In addition, Infrastructure Australia emphasized the need for
early community engagement—which can improve the quality of planning and reduce
opposition.
                                                                               box continues next page

       Box 3.2  Assessing Needs and Proposing a Pipeline—The Case of Infrastructure
       Australia (continued)

           Key strengths of the Australian system include the following:

       •	 Insulation from political pressures. As an independent body, Infrastructure Australia is, in prin-
          ciple, insulated from the political process and can therefore assess infrastructure needs and
          develop recommendations on the basis of objective criteria.
       •	 A structured approach. Infrastructure Australia applied a sequenced and structured approach
          to infrastructure planning by framing investment choices within a long-term assessment of
          needs (the Audit) and a considered evaluation of the various options for addressing those
          needs that is guided by a set of long-term goals (the Plan).
       •	 An integrated strategy. By considering all infrastructure sectors within a single plan that is
          guided by a set of long-term ambitions, the Infrastructure Plan provides for an integrated
          perspective of infrastructure.

          Such a holistic and integrated approach encourages greater alignment across sectors and
       investments and improves the scope for generating synergies.

       Conclusions
       Good infrastructure is key to Latin America’s ambitions in terms of growth, inclu-
       siveness, and environmental sustainability. But money is not necessarily the miss-
       ing ingredient for the region to achieve its ambitions. More focused goals and
       efficient strategies can substantially reduce financing needs. In addition, upstream
       reforms will enable Latin America to both improve spending efficiency and
       attract private financing on better terms—whether through PPPs or commercial
       borrowing by public enterprises. And efforts to improve public investment insti-
       tutions and frameworks—notably budgeting and procurement systems—should
       enable the region to substantially stretch the resources it already allocates to
       infrastructure.
          This report provides a framework for countries wishing to improve their infra-
       structure performance despite fiscal constraints. It does so by recommending a
       careful definition of priorities, highlighting steps that can be taken to improve
       efficiency, and noting the need to carefully chose between what should be
       funded by users versus taxpayers. But this report could usefully be comple-
       mented by more in-depth, country or regional, analysis of the following issues:

       •	 Quality of service—as chapter 1 makes clear, limited information is available
          on the quality of service, raising the question of whether infrastructure access
          levels paint a full picture of how well the region is doing.
       •	 How to manage the region’s sprawling urban development—a forthcoming
          World Bank report on urbanization will shed some light on this evolution
          based on new data and analysis.

•	 Subsidies—the limited data available suggest that subsidies, often poorly tar-
   geted, remain substantial in a number of countries, and may be larger than
   what the region invests in infrastructure.
•	 Public spending efficiency and fiscal space available for capital spending—this
   report is limited to somewhat anecdotal evidence regarding public spending
   efficiency, and it falls far short of a full analysis of fiscal space and of countries’
   ability to rebalance public spending in favor of capital spending.

   Public expenditure surveys focused on infrastructure would be extremely
valuable tools in helping governments understand where institutional weak-
nesses lie and the extent to which efficiency gains could help achieve
infrastructure goals.

	 1.	This discussion was developed based on Leigland, Trémolet, and Ikeda (2016).
	 2.	‘‘Commercial” capital or financing is meant here as capital or financing that subjects
     the borrower (for example, a utility) to the discipline of the market. It includes project
     and corporate finance, commercial bank financing, project and corporate bond issu-
     ance, and private equity; for example, through stock exchange listings or direct invest-
     ment. It would preclude financing from state-owned commercial banks, national
     development banks, or sovereign wealth funds investing in domestic jurisdictions
     (but not abroad) as well as MDB or DFI financing where there is an explicit or
     inferred sovereign counter guarantee.
	 3.	In addition, there may be potential to capture the value created through infrastructure
     investments in less traditional ways (land-value capture, congestion charging, parking
     fees) or through the commercial exploitation of infrastructure assets (advertising, real
     estate).

     framework; ground the selection of public–private partnerships in “value for

Procurement Performance of Latin
American Countries: Relatively
Good, but with Wide Variation
across Countries and Indicators




Although reforms have been undertaken by a number of countries throughout
Latin America, several areas can be further improved. The World Bank’s
Benchmarking Public Procurement 2017 found that suppliers identify obstacles
such as excessive bureaucracy and red tape in Colombia and Honduras; payment
delays in Argentina, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica; lack of transparency
and opaque tendering processes in Brazil and Mexico; lack of efficiency in
Barbados and Puerto Rico; and the list goes on.
   More generally, the Benchmarking Public Procurement 2017 data (see box
B.1) reveal that many Latin American countries still face challenges in estab-
lishing legal and regulatory environments that enhance efficient and transpar-
ent public procurement markets. On average, however, the region compares
reasonably well with other regions in all but one area measured: the region’s
score is less than half that of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries for recurrent delays in payments (     ­ figure B.1).
Timely payment of suppliers encourages firms’ participation in tenders, which
in turn will lead to more competition and better value for money for the pur-
chasing entity (Connell 2014). Payments take place within the recognized
good practice time frame of 30 days in only five economies in the region
(Belize, Grenada, Nicaragua, Peru, and the Bahamas) and can take six months
or longer in the region’s worse performers (the Dominican Republic and
Trinidad and Tobago).
   In addition, the region could improve its performance with respect to online
access to information and services. Digital tools can streamline public spending,
make it more transparent and evidence based, and integrate it with information
on market conditions. Only 13 out of 30 Latin American and Caribbean

       Box B.1  What Is the Benchmarking Public Procurement Database?
       The Benchmarking Public Procurement 2017 (BPP)a initiative is a global assessment of public
       procurement regulatory frameworks across 180 economies—of which 30 are in Latin America.
       It focuses on six key areas of the public procurement process for a tender of works, including
       the following:

       •	 Needs assessment, call for tender, and bid preparation indicators assess the quality, adequacy,
          and transparency of the information provided by the procuring entity to prospective
          bidders.
       •	 Bid submission indicators examine the requirements that suppliers must meet in order to bid
          effectively and avoid having their bid rejected.
       •	 Bid opening, evaluation, and contract award indicators measure the extent to which the
          regulatory framework and procedures provide a fair and transparent bid opening and
          evaluation process, as well as whether once the best has been identified, the contract is
          awarded transparently and the losing bidders are informed of the procuring entity’s
          decision.
       •	 Content and management of the procurement contract indicators focus on several aspects
          during the contract execution phase related to the modification and termination of the pro-
          curement contract and the procedure for accepting the completion of works.
       •	 Performance guarantee indicators examine the existence and requirements of the perfor-
          mance guarantee.
       •	 Payment of suppliers indicators focus on the time and procedure needed for suppliers to
          receive payment during the contract execution phase.

       countries evaluated make all procurement information available online, and 7
       have yet to establish an electronic portal dedicated to public procurement. The
       same goes for online services during the bid submission, bid evaluation, and
       award and contract management phases. Just as suppliers need to access informa-
       tion online, they should be able to conduct the procurement process online,
       regardless of what is being procured by the government.
          The availability of electronic tendering is not as widespread for the procure-
       ment of works as it is for the procurement of goods. In Chile for example, the
       electronic submission of bids has become the rule for the procurement of
       goods but not for the procurement of works. Similarly, when it comes to the
       bid opening session, bids are sometimes opened electronically in Brazil, Costa
       Rica, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, and Uruguay and never in the remaining
       24 economies.
          Performance guarantees, which are particularly important for public works,
       is another area where the benchmarking data highlight great variation among

Note: For each indicator developed, the scores of individual questions are averaged and multiplied by 100, resulting in a final score ranging from
0 to 100. The economies at the top of the range (with scores approaching 100) are considered to have a regulatory framework that closely aligns
with internationally recognized good practices, whereas the economies at the bottom of the range (scores closer to 0) have significant room for
improvement in the particular area measured. OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.




the different players in the region (figure B.2). Performance guarantees during
the contract execution phase are an important tool to ensure delivery of ser-
vice per contract terms and protect parties in case of delays in execution. All
30 economies measured in Latin America by the Benchmarking Public
Procurement initiative impose a performance guarantee requirement during
the contract execution phase. Performance guarantees should be well regulated in
order to protect suppliers and avoid creating an additional impediment for
them. For example, it is important for suppliers to have a choice with regard
to the form of performance guarantees. Costa Rica and Ecuador are the econo-
mies that provide the most options for the form of the guarantee, which can
include a certified check, a certificate of deposit, or a letter of credit, among
others. It is also critical that the legal framework set a timeframe for the pur-
chasing entity to return the performance guarantee after the execution of the
contract. Only 11 countries, such as El Salvador, Mexico, and Panama, impose
such a time limit.

          Regional averages hide the wide disparity between countries in the region.
       Out of the 30 economies measured, Ecuador, for example, shows high scores in
       most areas measured. Similarly, Costa Rica appears in the top five performing
       economies across three areas. Antigua and Barbuda and St. Lucia, on the other
       hand, show the weakest performance.

       Public Procurement of Public-Private Partnerships
       Overall, economies in Latin America perform well with respect to procurement
       for public-private partnerships (PPPs) based on data from the World Bank’s
       Benchmarking Public-Private Partnership Procurement 2017, placing second glob-
       ally behind the OECD high-income economies in two of four thematic areas
       (unsolicited proposals and contract management) (figure B.3).1 The region’s low-
       est performance is for the PPP preparation indicators.

                                                              The good average performance masks wide variation across countries
                                                           (figure B.4). Procurement is the area where the economies obtained more
                                                           similar scores, indicating a more consistent and overall adequate performance.
                                                           However, even in this area, there are outliers, such as Ecuador and Jamaica,
                                                           which score significantly lower than the other economies in the region.
                                                              Wide variations exist around unsolicited proposals, for which some
                                                           countries have either enacted comprehensive regulations (Colombia, Costa
                                                           Rica, Jamaica, and Peru) and others have no regulations at all (Guatemala,
                                                           Nicaragua, and Panama). Similarly, wide variations in scores appear around

                                                           relatively well in both areas (Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay), and oth-

                                                           area, but its scores are not as good for the preparation stage, particularly for
                                                           the concession regime.

                                                           But the area with the widest variation in performance is preparation of PPPs.

regulated and therefore not scored in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama).




conduct almost all of these assessments (such as Mexico and Jamaica), while
­
others conduct only one of them (Panama and Nicaragua), or none at all
(the Dominican Republic). And in Nicaragua, for example, the government is
not required to integrate the prioritization of PPP projects with other public
investment projects, nor are the assessments required.
    Our analysis also examines whether the Ministry of Finance, or a central bud-
getary authority, needs to approve the PPP project before a procurement process
is launched. According to our assessment, such an approval is not required in 4 of
the 14 economies measured (Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and
Nicaragua).
    Contract management is another area where a significant difference in perfor-
mance exists amongst economies. Although there are several factors that lead to
the lower performance of some economies in this area, a few particular ones
stand out. Honduras and Jamaica are the economies where the regulatory frame-
work does not expressly establish grounds for the termination of a PPP contract.
Our data also measure whether the regulatory framework establishes a specific

       dispute resolution mechanism, and we find that Colombia, Jamaica, Nicaragua,
       and Panama do not have such a system. Lastly, our data examine whether the
       regulatory framework expressly regulates the modification or renegotiation of a
       PPP contract, as well as the three circumstances that could be regulated (a change
       in the scope/object of contract, a change in the risk allocation of the contract, a
       change in the investment plan or duration of the contract). The regulatory
       frameworks in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua do not regulate
       the modification/renegotiation of a PPP contract.
          Overall, the regulatory frameworks governing the procurement of PPPs in
       Latin America are better than in other regions of the globe. However, there is
       room for improvement in all areas, to increase the quality of the regulatory
       framework to match those that exist in the OECD high-income economies.
       Preparation of PPPs appears to be the area where the region as a whole could
       focus its efforts in order to improve regulatory frameworks for PPPs. While the
       regulatory frameworks for PPPs in economies like Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay,
       and Peru are comparable to that of more mature markets, some other economies
       clearly lag behind in several aspects (Jamaica and Nicaragua).

The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint.
In support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and
print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide.
Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances
decreased, resulting in reduced paper c­ onsumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas
emissions, and waste.
   We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council

Infrastructure—power, water, sanitation, transport, flood protection, and telecommunications—is essential
for growth, poverty alleviation, social inclusion, resilience, and environmental sustainability. Despite
significant investment, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) does not have the infrastructure it needs
or deserves, given its income.

Although many argue that the solution to the infrastructure gap is to spend more, Rethinking Infrastructure
in Latin America and the Caribbean: Spending Better to Achieve More takes a different approach and considers
how to spend more wisely and efficiently on essential services.

The authors advocate beginning with a careful discussion of individual countries’ development priorities,
goals, and fiscal policies and ask three questions:

•	 What should LAC countries’ goals be?
•	 How can these goals be achieved as cost-effectively as possible?
•	 Who should pay to reach these goals?

Benchmarking the region in terms of infrastructure services reveals clear strengths and weaknesses. Access
to water and electricity is relatively good, with the potential for the region’s electricity sector to drive
competitive advantage. In contrast, transport and sanitation are key areas for further development.
The authors also identify and analyze some of the emerging challenges for the region—climate change,
changing demand from a growing middle class, and urbanization—that will exert increasing pressure on
infrastructure and policy makers alike.

Improving the region’s infrastructure performance in the context of tight fiscal space will require spending
better on well-identified priorities. Unlike most infrastructure diagnostics, this publication argues that much
of what is needed lies outside of the infrastructure sector in the form of broader government issues—from
competition policy to budgeting rules that no longer solely focus on controlling cash expenditures. The
authors find that sector reforms are required as well, and that traditional recommendations continue to
apply regarding independent, well-performing regulators and better corporate governance. They highlight
the critical importance of cost recovery, where feasible and desirable, as the basis for future commercial
finance of infrastructure services. LAC has the means and potential to do better—and it can do so by
spending more efficiently on the right things.
