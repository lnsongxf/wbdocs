Absolute Risk: The larger the circle, the higher the Annual Average Losses that the province could
potentially incur over the long term.
Relative Risk: The darker the color, the higher the ratio of AAL/Province Exposure. The darkest color
represents the province of Usulutan which has a higher proportion of vulnerable structures due to
construction types and/or potentially higher earthquake intensity.

 What is at risk in El Salvador?
 Economic assets such as residential
 and non-residential buildings are at risk.
 These assets that are exposed to natural
 disasters are referred to as a country’s
 Building Exposure.

What are the potential losses in El Salvador?
These graphs show the estimated potential future losses to El Salvador that could be caused by earthquakes and
hurricanes that occur within a given return period. In 2001, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck El Salvador. If this
historical event were to happen in 2015, it would cause losses of US$ 1,810M, amounting to 7% of GDP.
