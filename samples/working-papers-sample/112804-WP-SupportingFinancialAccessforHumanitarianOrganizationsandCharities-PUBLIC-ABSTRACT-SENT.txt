  Suggestions: Information requested from NPOs
  •	 Develop (Wolfsberg Group-type) questionnaire for NPOs to serve as a baseline for due diligence
     requests;
  •	 Develop a KYC database/repository for financial institutions on NPOs;
  •	 Source of data; use institutions that are already collecting data: NPO-umbrella organizations,
     donors or other bodies (function as a knowledge source on NPOs);
  •	 Achieve clarity on and formulate specific risk mitigation measures and parameters in high-risk
     corridors;
  •	 Improve mechanisms to communicate, provide assurance/clarity to downstream financial
     institutions, once originator financial institution has approved client transaction (downstream
     information).

    Suggestions: Regulatory and Policy landscape
    •	 Develop positive incentives (“carrots”) for financial institutions to keep banking humanitarian
       organizations;
    •	 Repackage regulatory information for NPOs to provide them with clear guidance on financial
       institution expectations;
    •	 Enhance NPO specific language within existing examiners manual or other regulatory tools to
       better articulate nuances of risk for NPOs;
    •	 Multi-stakeholder developed training/communication training for examiners;
    •	 Risk-sharing arrangement between financial institutions and governmental organizations,
       especially where an NPO is executing a government program. (E.g. partnering with financial
       institutions to disburse humanitarian aid funds, alternative corridors);
    •	 Engage with authorities and correspondent banks beyond the US.
