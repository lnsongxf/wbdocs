Abstract

Tobacco Taxes are deemed regressive as poorest families tend to allocate
larger shares of their budget to purchase tobacco. However, as taxes also
discourage tobacco use, some of the most adverse effects, including higher
medical expenses, lower life expectancy at birth, added years of disability
among smokers, and reductions in the quality of life, among other, would
be reduced. This paper describes and simulates the effects of the tobacco
tax on incomes in Chile assuming three different price-elasticity scenarios
for different income deciles of the population. Results show that although
price increase for tobacco through higher taxes generates negative income
variations across all groups in a population, under a more comprehensive
scenario that includes benefits through lower medical expenses and an
increase in working years, the results invert, and the overall monetary effect
of the taxation policy becomes positive. Moreover, the reduction in medical
expenses seems to be the main driver of the increase in net incomes
because of the reduction in tobacco-related problems that require expensive
treatments. Lastly, as the distributional effects of tobacco taxes are directly
related to the long-term price elasticities of tobacco consumption, it would
be advisable a coordination between taxation and behavioral change policies
across income groups. (JEL Codes: H23, H31, I18, O15)

costs are usually considered to be either direct
or indirect. Direct costs include the monetary
value of the consumption of goods and services
motivated and, in many cases, compelled because
of tobacco use. These are divided into health
care costs (hospitalization, medication, medical
supplies, equipment, and so on) and non–health
care costs (job replacements for sick smokers,
insurance, cleaning up the cigarette ash, stubs,
packaging, and smoke residue of smokers, and
so on). The indirect costs include the loss of
productivity because of lost working days related
to smoking illnesses and the value of the lives
prematurely lost. Both effects are incorporated in
the disability-adjusted life years indicator (WHO
2011).

Focusing on the costs of health systems,
Lightwood et al. (2000) estimate the cost of
tobacco use. They suggest that the gross health
cost in high-income countries fluctuates between
0.1 and 1.0 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP). Limited data inhibit accurate estimates on
low- and middle-countries, but the authors argue
that the price elasticity could be as high as the
elasticities in high-income countries. Meanwhile,
Verguet et al. (2015) analyze the health effects of
a price increase in China. Their research concludes
that a 50 percent rise in prices would result in 231
million years of life gained over 50 years, with a
significant impact in the lowest income quintile.
Pichón-Riviere et al. (2014) estimate that tobacco
use in Chile would reduce life expectancy by
nearly 4.0 years among women and 4.3 years
among men. There would also be about 379
thousand life days lost, which is over a thousand
years.8 They estimate the annual direct cost of
tobacco-related disease in the Chilean health
system is about 0.6 percent of GDP.

                              Days lost refer to years of life lost (YLL) because of premature mortality. Another indicator is years lost
                             because of disability (YLD) among people living with poor health and its consequences. Usually, disability-

      Tobacco expenditure: We estimate the
      variation in tobacco consumption after the
      tax increase, considering the change in prices
      (∆P), the tobacco price elasticity ε, and the
      tobacco expenditure of decile i in period 0
      (Expenditurei0).

      We divide the change in tobacco expenditure
      by the total expenditure for each decile group i,
      thereby obtaining a comparable per household
      measure of the change in tobacco expenditure
      relative to the total expenditure of each decile
      group.

      Medical expenses: We estimate the change in
      medical expenses of tobacco-related diseases
      in equation (5), where the cost of the treatment
      of tobacco-related diseases for income decile i
      is obtained from Pichón-Riviere et al. (2014) and

      Equation 5 shows the income gains related to
      the reduction of medical expenses because of
      the reduction of tobacco consumption in the
      long term. Although the calculation is not realistic
      in the short-term, we assume that the effects
      of tobacco-related diseases will immediately
      diminish with the reduction in tobacco
      consumption.13

                                   on medical expenditures. These estimates may also differentiate the effect associated with people who stop
                                   consuming tobacco versus people who do not start because of the tax policies. Because of data restrictions,
                                   we cannot use these assumptions in this paper.

Increase in working life: We estimate the impact on
incomes arising from the increase in labor years. In
our base line, we estimate the income lost because
of lost working years associated with tobacco
consumption (equation 6)14. The years lost are
distributed across each decile proportionately to
the number of households that consume tobacco,
and the income lost is estimated as the average
income per household. We then estimate the
effect of the tax increase in relation to the income
gains because of increases in working years. We
expect that incomes will increase as the number
of years lost because of premature deaths from
tobacco consumption decrease.

Lastly, we estimate the total income gains for
each income group by adding the results of
the reduction of medical treatments, the gains
in working years, and the increase in tobacco
expenditures (see equation 1).

a. Elasticity parameters
After defining the model to calculate the income
impact of tobacco taxes, we examine the
estimates in the literature on elasticities, disease
prevalence, the cost of medical treatments, and
mortality patterns. Several studies have estimated
tobacco price elasticity in Chile and Latin America.
Within this research, the work of Debrott Sánchez
(2006) stands out for the use of prices and
quantities among tobacco firms in Chile. The
parameters estimated by Debrott Sánchez are
−0.21 for the price elasticity and −0.23 for the
income elasticity. Using a myopic consumption
model, the author estimates a short-term elasticity
of −0.22 and a long-term elasticity of −0.45. For
China Verguet et al. (2015) consider an average
price elasticity of −0.38, which varies from −0.64 in
the poorest quintile to −0.12 in the richest quintile.



                              14
                                   We assume that income is equal to the average consumption of each household per decile.



                                                                                                                             13

b. Tobacco mortality and morbidity
To estimate the medical costs of tobacco
consumption, we examine tobacco-related
medical treatments and deaths. The Department
of Health Statistics and Information of the ministry
provides information about mortality related to
tobacco consumption in Chile during 2009. As a
second source of information, the total number of
tobacco-related events are obtained from Pichón-
Riviere et al. (2014) (table 2).

d. Age pattern of mortality
To obtain the working years lost, we need to look
at early mortality related to tobacco events. The
medical events associated with tobacco have a
strong correlation with age and years of smoking.
Table 6 shows age patterns in tobacco-related
deaths. These years lost will be distributed among
the population in analysis, and the income (or
wages) of this population segment is going to be

e. Summary of descriptive statistics
Table 7 summarizes the most important
indicators, which shows total monthly
expenditure from the Household Consumption
Survey, as well as the proportion of cigarette
expenditure. We estimate the cost of medical
treatment of tobacco-related diseases as a
proportion of monthly income for each income
decile. We then estimate the share of income
lost because of the working years lost because of
tobacco-related mortality.

These three scenarios allow us to have a notion of               regressive because the lower-income groups

As a first step, we estimate the income changes                  making the tax effect more flat. To show the effect

                                     not provide these types of differentiations, but only due to income. ISAPRES insure 16.5% of the country

     To approximate the first problem, we analyze
     only single member households, with members
     over 40 years old. For these households we can
     see a patter between Medical expenses and
     tobacco consumption. In particular, individuals
     that with tobacco monthly consumption of
     over US$ 100 show high medical expenses. In
     the appendix we add estimations for single
     households with members over 20, 30, 40 and
     50 years old. These results provide us with hints
     regarding the limitation of a household survey,
     and the importance of medical expenses for
     heavy smokers.

   In conclusion, the tobacco tax increase has a
   small but negative effect in the presence of a low
   tobacco price elasticity. This assumption does
   not consider other policies, such as smoking
   cessation and advertising programs that may be
   implemented in parallel. On the assumption of
   medium-bound elasticity, with variations across
   income deciles, we find that the tobacco tax
   generates welfare gains among lower-income
   groups. In a scenario of upper-bound elasticity,
   there would be income gains across all groups of
   the population. Moreover, the impact would be
   particularly important in the case of lower-income
   deciles. These results are in line with the literature,
   showing the important benefits of the reduction
   in tobacco consumption that may occur through
   diverse policy mechanisms.

The results provide evidence to support the
maintenance or increase in tobacco taxes.
The analysis also shows the importance of the
price elasticity of tobacco, which indicates the
relevance of the interaction of taxation and other
policies. In particular, this research suggests
that taxation should always be supported by
actions that could change or alter the behavior
of consumers, increasing elasticity levels. Because
the reaction to a price change is different in
each income group, specific programs should
be implemented to target consumption among
lower-income groups by supporting smoking
cessation and through advertising adapted to the
particular sociocultural context. There is thus a
need for an integrative approach to anti-tobacco
policies that favor coordination between taxation
and behavioral change policies to generate
higher social returns. Further research could
investigate which combination of programs is
more efficient in deterring smoking among each
socioeconomic group.
