                                     Rwanda Economic Update • Edition No. 10   i
                                                FOREWORD

T  he Rwanda Economic Update (REU) reports on and synthesizes recent economic developments,
   and places them in a medium term, regional, and global context. It analyses the implications of
these developments and policies for the outlook of the economy. These reports attempt to make
an analytical contribution to the implementation of Rwanda’s national development strategy.
Each edition includes a special feature on a selected topic. The report is intended for a wide
audience, including policy makers, business leaders, other market participants, the community of
analysts engaged in Rwanda’s economy, and civil society.

The tenth edition of the REU was jointly prepared by the Rwanda Macroeconomics and Fiscal
Management Global Practice team and the Trade and Competitiveness Practice team at the
World Bank. The teams were led by Aghassi Mkrtchyan (Country Economist) and Hamidou Sorgo
(Senior Private Sector Specialist). Peace Aimee Niyibizi (consultant) led the analysis of recent
macroeconomic developments. Susan Kayonde (Private Sector Specialist) led the section on export
sector performance. Hibret Maemir (Research Analyst) led the exporting firm analysis. The section
on productivity and structural transformation drew on an initial draft paper by Yoichiro Ishihara
(Senior Economist). Sonia Plaza (Senior Economist) and Shahrzad Mobasher Fard (Consultant) also
contributed to the report. The team was supervised by Kevin Carey (Lead Economist) and Johan
Mistiaen (Lead Economist and Program Leader) and Paul Brenton (Lead Economist). The report was
prepared under the overall guidance of Diariétou Gaye (Country Director), Abebe Adugna (Practice
Manager), Catherine K. Masinde (Practice Manager) and Yasser El-Gammal (Country Manager). Sylvie
Ingabire and Karima Ladjo (Team Assistants) supported the team. Yoichiro Ishihara (Senior Economist),
Marina Bakanova (Senior Economist), and Ali Zafar (Senior Economist) were peer reviewers.

Although this report does not represent the official views of the Rwandan authorities, the
macroeconomic unit of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) and the
National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) were engaged in its formulation and provided valuable comments.
The World Bank team appreciates their contributions.

     	   Growth in 2016 remained strong by global and regional standards but it decelerated markedly

     	 Fiscal tightening and adverse weather conditions affecting agricultural output drove the
       slowdown.

 Box 1: Rebasing Rwanda’s national accounts

  The National Institute of Statistics on Rwanda (NISR) uses the United Nations’ System of National
  Accounts (2008) guidelines in compiling Rwanda’s national accounts. In the last five years, NISR
  has carried out two rebasing exercises following the recent Integrated Household Living Conditions
  Survey. The purpose of the economic rebasing of early 2017, which involved changing the base year
  from 2011 to 2014, was to update the production structure, align structural changes in relative prices
  of various products with consumption patterns, utilisation, and acquisition of capital goods. The
  exercise has given the opportunity to improve the methods and indicators used to extrapolate the
  base levels. For example, NISR’s Seasonal Agricultural Surveys introduced in 2014 has greatly affected
  the structure of economy – something the national account at 2011-base year did not capture well.

  Food crops, trade, and public sector related services accounted for most of the change in Rwanda’s
  production structure due to rebasing (Figure 4). The share of food crops in domestic output decreased
  from 22.0 percent to 17.1 percent, while the overall share of agriculture declined from 32.3 percent to
  28.8 percent. Industry’s share increased from 14.4 percent to 17.2 percent. The most negatively and
  positively affected services are respectively trade services and government led services, i.e. public
  administration and defence, compulsory social security. Among other major changes were the decline
  in the share of wholesale and retail trade, and the increase of the share of government led services.
  As a result of the rebasing exercise, the growth rates of 2014 and 2015 were also revised. (Figure 5)

 External Sector
 Key Points:
     	   Rwanda’s current account deficit continued to widen in 2016, albeit with a slower pace than
         in the previous two years.
     	   Although exports grew faster than imports, the negative trade balance slightly widened.
     	   The growth in exports was driven by a strong performance in non-traditional export products,
         as export earnings from Rwanda’s traditional products remained weak.
     	   The first quarter of 2017 showed substantial improvement in the trade balance.

 Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Developments
 Key Points:
     	   The environment for monetary policy characterised by a combination of a growth slowdown,
         inflation pressures and external imbalances was very challenging in 2016.
     	   Inflation has remained high largely because of the drought; the pass-through from exchange
         rate depreciation also played a role.
     	   Credit growth sharply decelerated in 2016.

    	 The NEER measures the average change in a country’s nominal exchange rate against a number of other currencies during a given
      period compared with a base year. Unlike the bilateral exchange rate, the NEER is an index, not the relative price of one currency with
      respect to another, weighted as an average of the exchange rates of a country with respect to its major trading partners’ currencies
      and their trade weights. The REER is an important refinement of the NEER, calculated by adjusting its NEER for differences in inflation
      at home and abroad. Both indexes, REER and NEER, provide a measure of a country’s export competitiveness: a rise in the index implies
      a fall in competitiveness. A country whose NEER and REER are depreciating is trading on worsening terms, as it costs that country more
      to buy goods and services from abroad.

       disaggregation allows better understanding the sources and patterns of productivity growth. One of these approaches is to distinguish
       between productivity gains from the inter-sectoral shift of labour and so-called “within” sector productivity changes, which in Rwanda’s
       case can be done by using the national account and household surveys.

Annex B3: Growth Decomposition Methodology

A growth accounting exercise is one of the most commonly used economic tools to decompose sources of
growth at a firm or country level. At a country level, the exercise decomposes the contributions of the production
factors including capital, labour and productivity to economic growth. More specifically, the exercise enables
us to decompose economic growth into a weighted average of the growth rate of labour and capital, and total
factor productivity (TFP) as a residual.

This exercise uses the following Cobb-Douglas production function:
with being the capital share of income. This formula shows that changes in output can be caused by changes
in capital stock (Kt), the labour force (Lt), the quality of Labor (Ht) and TFP.

The application in Rwanda’s context also requires assumptions on the capital share of income         , the
depreciation rate   , return to average years of schooling     . Based on various literatures on a growth
accounting, the growth accounting exercise for Rwanda assumes that = 0.35, = 5 percent, and = 5 percent.

Annex C1: EXPORT PATTERNS AND DYNAMICS: FIRM-LEVEL EVIDENCE

In order to benchmark the performance of Rwandan exporters relative to the rest of the world, a cross-
country regression has been estimated on a panel of country-year exporter dynamics indicators covering
the 2006-2014 period including all developing and developed countries available in the Exporter Dynamics
Database (EDD). Table C1 displays the results from cross-country regressions where the dependent variables
are each of a series of exporter competitiveness and dynamics indicators. The regression controls for the
size and the level of development of the country and for time trends. Each regression includes a dummy
variable identifying the observations for Rwanda whose coefficient will determine how Rwanda performs
relative to the benchmark countries.

Annex C2: Export Growth Decomposition


The change in aggregate Rwanda export between year                 and year ,        can be decomposed into the
change due to increases or decreases in export at the existing exporting firms (i.e., intensive margin), the
increase due to entry of new exporting firms, and the decrease in the due to the exit of existing exporters.




Where          is the change in Rwanda export between year         and year ,    is the set of continuing exporters
that are active in export markets in both       and ,     is the set of entering exporters that are active in export
markets in but not in         , and   is the set of exiting exporters that are active in export markets in          but
not in .


The change in exports shipped by continuing exporters can be further decomposed into new destinations,
dropped destinations, and continuing destinations. The decomposition of export growth of continuing firms
along the destination dimension




where                 is the growth in exports of continuing exporters in Rwanda between            and ,         is the
set of continued destinations that are served in both           and ,      is the set of new destinations that are
served in but not in         , and    is the set of dropped destinations that are served in          but not in .


Finally, the exports of continuing firms in their continued destinations along the product dimension can be
decomposed as:




Where                      is the growth in exports of continuing exporters in their continued destinations and
   ,       is the set of continued HSs 4-digit products that are exported in both       and ,      is the set of new
products that are exported in t but not in        , and      is the set of dropped products that are exported in

Annex C3: The role of intermediate inputs on export performance – a regression analysis


This section explores the link between imported intermediate inputs and export performance using a regression
analysis. The objective is to explore whether firms that are both exporting and importing intermediate inputs
differ in terms of a number of export performance indicators – exporter size, export growth, export product
scope, market diversification, and export quality (measured by the relative unit prices). All regressions include
firm fixed effect to control for time-invariant factors that lead to a correlation between imported intermediate
inputs and export. The cyclical effects are also accounted by including year fixed effects.


Table C4 presents the results of the regression. Columns (1-5) of Table 2 report results of the regression of
different measures of firm export performance on an indicator whether exporter is also an intermediate input
importer, controlling for firm and year fixed effects. The result suggests that, on average, firms that increase
their reliance on intermediate inputs tend to expand their product scope, measured by firm-level count of
unique HS 6 products. The result also suggests that firms importing intermediate inputs tend to expand their
destination markets. Import of intermediate input does appear to affect export growth and quality of export,
measured by the relative price export products.


The effect of intermediate imports on firm-export performance may depend not only on the trade status but
also the level of intermediate input sourcing. Thus, limiting the analysis to binary import status may mask
important heterogeneity among exporting firms. The figure below displays a kernel density estimate of the
distribution of intermediate input imports across exporting firms. As shown in the figure, exporting firms differ
significantly in terms of the level of their imported intermediate inputs. To account for this heterogeneity,
Columns (6-10) reports regression results where a continuous variable, logarithm of value of intermediate
inputs, is used instead of importer-exporter status dummy. The results are generally consistent with the
findings with the binary trade status indicator. A greater use of intermediate inputs is associated with higher
value of export.




 	 Estimating the causal effects of imported intermediate inputs on firm-level export outcome is notoriously difficult. One of the empirical
27

   challenges is that the decision to import and export may be jointly determined. The decision to import and export may be affected by
   change in firm’s observed and unobserved characteristics. For example, it is possible that the decision to import intermediate input
   is likely to be correlated with other firm characteristics that can independently increase export performance. If such things exist, the
   estimation may be misleading. The effect of intermediate imports on export outcome is thus subject to concerns with endogeneity and
   reverse causality. Although the fixed effect estimation circumvents the time-invariant heterogeneity, it is possible that the result may be
   biased due to the time varying confounders. In view of these concerns, the results should be interpreted as a correlation rather causality.

 Note: All regression results include firm fixed effect to account of time-invariant firm heterogeneity. Exporter-Importer Dummy is a
       dummy variable for current exporter-importer status, which takes 1 if the firm is a two-way trader in year t and 0 otherwise.
       One is added to the total value of import in order to avoid omitting pure exporters from the analysis due to log transformation.
