 Executive Summary
 The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Poverty Diagnostic (WPD) in the Democratic republic of
 Congo is part of a global initiative to improve evidence on the linkages between WASH and
 poverty. The diagnostic provides a detailed analysis of sector status, strengths, and weaknesses
 to inform the attainment of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that aim for
 universal access to safely managed water and sanitation.


 Poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo
 The Democratic Republic of Congo has the third highest poverty rate in the world and
 concentrates the fifth largest number of poor people within its borders. The number of poor
 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo has increased by over 7 million since 2005, driven
 by the second highest fertility rate in Africa. Poverty rates remain in excess of 80 percent in
 the forested northwest and inaccessible central Democratic Republic of Congo and are above
 50 percent even around major agglomerations, such as Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, which
 concentrate millions of poor (map ES.1). Indeed, a striking characteristic of price-level adjusted
 poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo is that overall it is almost as high in urban areas
 (62.5 percent) as it is in rural zones (64.9 percent), and is particularly extreme in small towns
 (81 percent), which are labor abundant, capital deficient, ill-connected, and marred by
 widespread un- and under-employment.

 Multidimensional poverty is high and human development indicators are among the lowest
 in the world. Despite improvement over the past decade, the Democratic Republic of Congo
 continues to rank at the bottom of the United Nations (UN) Human Development Index and

WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                                            xi
       other indicators of multidimensional poverty (OPHI 2016). The Democratic Republic of
       Congo has low life expectancy (58 years) and child mortality in excess of even the Sub-
       Saharan average (World Bank 2016c).

       The scope of the Democratic Republic of Congo for diversifying its economy and investing in
       human capital through education, health, and basic services, such as WASH, is narrow. Many of
       the key drivers of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s post-war growth are now under threat.
       A constitutional crisis threatens broader peace, residual armed conflict festers in central and
       eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and public resources are under pressure from low
       prices and transactional politics. At the same time, the universal access targets of the new
       SDGs require major efforts, given the present situation of WASH services in the Democratic
       Republic of Congo. The Democratic Republic of Congo may be the ultimate test for the World
       Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity, and the realism
       of the new SDGs.


       WASH Services in the Democratic Republic of Congo
       Access to improved WASH services is low in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has barely
       improved over the past decade. Improved water facilities are available to only 52 percent of the
       population and less than 29 percent have access to improved sanitation (UNICEF and WHO
       2015). These access rates are substantially below Sub-Saharan averages. Access to both
       improved water and sanitation has risen by barely 3 percent since the first democratic elections
       in 2006 and the Democratic Republic of Congo missed the 2015 Millennium Development
       Goals (MDGs) for WASH. In the same period, due to rapid population growth, the total number
       of Congolese lacking access to improved water and sanitation facilities increased by more than
       a quarter to over 35 million and 53 million, respectively.

       Urban areas have much higher access to improved water sources than rural zones, while
       differences in improved sanitation access are more compressed at lower levels. Improved water
       access in cities towers at 81 percent compared to only 31 percent in rural areas. However,
       urban access has been eroding over the past decade in the face of rapid urbanization. Large
       access inequalities exist between major cities and more marginal urban areas. In the sanitation
       sector, long-term aggregate trends indicate nearly equivalent low access rates of approximately
       28.5 percent in urban and 28.7 percent in rural areas, with a negative urban trend contrasted
       by positive rural access improvements over the past decade (UNICEF and WHO 2015). Open
       defecation is more common in rural areas, though remains below 20 percent, a relatively low
       value in the regional context.

       The poor in the Democratic Republic of Congo have significantly less access to improved water
       and sanitation than the wealthier. Access to improved water and sanitation is almost 10 percent
       lower among the poor than the non-poor. Stratification of access increases with wealth: among
       the top 10 percent of wealthiest households, over 95 percent have access to improved water
       and almost 35 percent to improved sanitation, but only 22 percent and 17 percent of the
       bottom 40 percent, respectively. Location is critically important: the poor in larger cities tend
       to have much better WASH services than small-town and rural households at the same or even
       higher level of income (figure ES.1).


       The New Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
       and the Water Quality Problem
       The SDGs set ambitious new targets for WASH: universal access to truly safe facilities by 2030.
       In the new framework, the aim is to provide all Congolese people with water sources that are
       not only technically “improved” as the MDGs targeted, but on premises, continuously available,
       and free of contamination. For sanitation, the new SDG target also goes beyond the MDG aim
       of non-shared “improved” facilities and, in addition, requires a handwashing facility with water

 and cleansing agent, as well as the safe disposal of fecal matter. As figure ES.2 illustrates,
 such high-quality access is currently very rare in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

 Setting the bar higher is necessary, however, because “improved” sources are just not safe
 enough. The WPD carried out water quality tests across the Democratic Republic of Congo
 showing extremely widespread fecal contamination even of sources that are “improved”
 according to the definition of the Joint Monitoring Programme of the World Health Organization
 and UNICEF. More than a third of piped water tested in Kinshasa was contaminated with
 Escherichia coli at point of use, and in some provincial towns and rural areas contamination of
 improved water exceeded 80  percent of tested samples. Similarly, few households have
 handwashing facilities with soap, and even the biggest cities of the Democratic Republic of
 Congo lack fecal sludge treatment sites. Thus, most fecal sludge from improved toilets is
 ultimately dumped unsafely or leaks into the environment. This contamination is a critical
 problem and has contributed to a silent emergency of malnutrition.


WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                                                                    xiii
       A Silent Emergency: Malnutrition and Its
       Link to Poor WASH
       A silent emergency is placing Democratic Republic of Congo’s poor and rapidly growing
       population at risk of permanent disconnect: widespread malnutrition, to which WASH is
       a key contributing factor. Food insecurity and malnutrition are rampant in the Democratic
       Republic of Congo. Data from the latest (2014) Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
       (Enquête Démographique et de Santé [EDS]) reveals that a staggering 43  percent of
       Congolese children under five years are chronically malnourished (figure ES.3). A survey
       conducted by the WPD showed just how widespread anxiety about nutrition is. Even in
       Kinshasa, in 2016, almost 60 percent of the non-poor and over 75 percent of the poor
       had worried about not having enough to eat over the past 12 months.

       Malnutrition is an acute and long-term health risk and is linked to poor WASH. Stunting is a
       powerful risk factor and is associated with 53 percent of infectious disease-related deaths
       in developing countries. Malnutrition can also have long-lasting negative effects, including a
       reduced capacity for manual work, poor mental development, and behavioral abnormalities.
       This risks long-term disadvantages for affected individuals and compromises the
       development of the Democratic Republic of Congo as a whole. A growing literature shows
       how poor WASH contributes to malnutrition by transmitting pathogens and infections that
       inhibit nutritional uptake through diarrhea, parasites, enteric inflammation, and dysfunction
       (Cumming and Cairncross 2016).

       This diagnostic confirms that unsafe WASH is closely related to morbidity and mortality in the
       Democratic Republic of Congo. WASH is one of the top five risk factors associated with death
       and disability in the country (IHME 2015). The WPD survey data provides evidence for a
       significant reduction in the probability of stunting among children under five years old in
       households with access to safely managed water (SDG Target Tier, free of contamination).
       A significant link between poor WASH access and anemia, which reinforces other WASH-related
       malnutrition effects, is also shown. These links highlight the importance of the SDG’s focus on
       water quality and the sanitation service chain to truly improve human health and long-term
       development.


       Focusing on Core WASH Service Challenges and
       Their Institutional Origins
       Progress toward the SDGs will require a focus on core WASH service gaps. In the water sector,
       four challenges stand out: the erosion of urban supply in the face of rapid urbanization, the
       inequality in access between major cities and marginal urban areas on the one hand, and rural
       zones on the other, as well as the cross-cutting problem of water quality. In the sanitation

 sector, the rural Ecoles et Villages Assainis ([EVA] Healthy Schools and Villages) program has led
 to progress, but is struggling to scale and sustain results. In cities, decades of neglect have
 led to a near total absence of public services. These gaps cannot be closed by more finance
 alone, but require new efforts to create institutions that can deliver safely managed WASH
 services in the long run.

 The institutional structure of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s WASH sector continues to
 be characterized by three interlinked challenges: institutional fragmentation, capacity gaps,
 and a bias toward specific institutions and services. The WASH sector remains split
 between  seven ministries, reducing the efficiency and coherence of policy making and
 implementation. Capacity gaps are a critical problem, especially as a decentralization
 process has increasingly shifted responsibilities to underresourced and inexperienced
 local governments. In an overall divided, underresourced, and low-capacity sector, the
 limited finance available has been biased to two institutional channels: the urban water
 utility Régie de Distribution d’Eau (REGIDESO) and the EVA program led by UNICEF and the
 Ministry of Public Health (figure ES.4) and associated services.

 Concentrating sparse funds in this manner has a strong justification, but also clear challenges.
 Given sector fragmentation, low absorption capacity, and almost universally high needs, it is
 rational to maximize impact by focusing on the relatively best-equipped counterparts or
 programs and pick low-hanging fruit. A consequence of this strategy, however, has been a focus
 on subsectors and geographic areas that are already better served, and a perpetuation of the
 weakness of disadvantaged institutions and service areas.

 Core service challenges are thus linked to institutional weaknesses. The erosion in urban water
 supply and increasing gaps between major and minor cities are directly related to the
 concentration of funds on REGIDESO, which is struggling to reform itself and reach beyond its
 traditional service centers. The weakness of alternative supply models and rural institutions
 has further aggravated REGIDESO’s limitations, while the lack of policy leadership and
 regulation has prevented even a systematic understanding of the scale of water quality
 problems, much less enforcement. Urban sanitation services are nonexistent due to the lack

       of policy leadership, disengaged municipalities, and historic non-involvement of REGIDESO,
       which limit the implementation capacity of the subsector. While the EVA program has done
       better in attracting funds to rural areas, it has struggled to sustain and scale-up results due to
       weak ownership and lack of support from rural state institutions for its NGO-driven service-
       delivery model. These core institutional weaknesses, main sector specific constraints and
       resulting service gaps are summarized in figure ES.5.


       The New Water Law as an Opportunity for Change
       A new Water Law and Policy (2015–16) offer a unique opportunity for the sector, providing
       reform momentum and a legal basis to address many of the institutional weaknesses that
       underlie service gaps. The impact of the new Water Law and associated policy on the
       institutional structure is potentially profound. A dedicated water ministry, regulator, and
       potential re-ordering of the sanitation sector could decisively reduce fragmentation and
       provide stronger leadership on issues such as water quality. The recognition of the principle
       of at-cost tariffs could improve cost recovery, while investments in marginal urban areas could
       be boosted by the shift of responsibility for infrastructure to provincial governments, and
       support for delegated management and autonomous systems. Decentralization of
       responsibility could also strengthen local government’s role in donor-financed rural WASH
       programs. A key challenge will be realizing the law’s potential in face of an entrenched sector
       structure and complex political reality.

       The law’s implementation must navigate not only the complexity and inertia of the Democratic
       Republic of Congo’s vast state apparatus during an ongoing political crisis, but an incomplete
       decentralization effort. The 2006 Constitution defined the Democratic Republic of Congo as a
       unitary, but decentralized state and the number of provinces increased from 11 to 26 in the
       process. Yet, the decentralization agenda remains incomplete. Provincial revenues have
       consistently been below the mandated share and central government has continued to assert
       its authority, leaving new local government entities with limited means and capacity to govern
       and deliver basic services such as WASH. Realizing the law’s potential in this context will be
       no mean feat.

 A Country at the Crossroads
 The Democratic Republic of Congo is at a major crossroads: after a decade of little progress, the
 country must rise to the challenge of the SDG targets in a context of state fragility, high poverty,
 demographic growth, and urbanization. While the challenge is immense, making significant
 progress is critical to avoiding a permanent disconnect of the country’s vulnerable population.
 The analysis and key recommendations of this diagnostic suggest priorities for government
 and its partners to focus their efforts and maximize the chance of real improvement in the
 WASH sector and, thus, human health and development.


 Key Facts and Messages
 The most important facts and messages emerging from the Democratic Republic of Congo
 WASH Poverty Diagnostic, which provide a basis for further awareness raising, planning, and
 discussions with sector stakeholders, are the following:




       Fact 1: Drinking water quality is low across the Democratic
       Republic of Congo and responsible for negative health outcomes.

       Poor water quality is a core service gap at the heart of the Democratic Republic of
       Congo’s WASH challenges. Low quality of supply and treatment, low levels of
       sanitation access, fecal pollution of the environment, as well as unsanitary handling
       and storage of drinking water by households conspire to cause widespread
       contamination. The WASH Poverty Diagnostic shows that pollution of water with
       E. coli at point of use is common across improved and unimproved sources, is high
       in the capital Kinshasa, and near universal in some rural areas. This contributes to
       extraordinarily elevated levels of water-related disease and child malnutrition and
       thus represents a direct threat to human health and development in the Democratic
       Republic of Congo.



 Message 1: Prioritize water quality in line with the new SDG targets. The new WASH SDG
 targets emphasize quality of access. Eliminating water contamination is the most important
 aspect of this. Water quality needs to be prioritized at all levels, from the normative-
 regulatory to programs and project implementation. Water quality should be a focus of the
 expected new water ministry and regulator. Donor interventions should explicitly target
 water quality instead of only access, as contaminated “improved” facilities are part of the
 problem. Approaches integrating water with sanitation improvements are critical to reduce
 cross-contamination. Monitoring of water quality must become more common and
 integrated into projects, facilitated by simple, cheap new testing technology, such as the
 one used by this diagnostic. Until reliable infrastructure is in place, fail-safe interventions
 directly targeting water quality, such as point-of-use treatment, may help alleviate health
 impacts among the most vulnerable.

 Message 2: Strengthen cross-sectoral coordination around the core issue of child malnutrition.
 Child malnutrition is one of the most serious long-term health threats to which poor water
 quality contributes, along with other key factors such as food security and education. Focusing
 on child malnutrition can be a cross-sectoral rallying point for a forward-looking, consensus-
 building approach to maximizing the impact of WASH interventions. A new WASH Poverty Risk




WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                     xvii
         Model (PRM) developed by this diagnostic shows where in the Democratic Republic of Congo
         children can benefit most from WASH improvements.




              Fact 2: Access to sanitation is lagging behind access to water and is a
              particularly grave health risk in urban areas.

              Access to improved sanitation is significantly lower than access to water. Handwashing
              and safe disposal of fecal sludge, as targeted by the SDGs, are virtually unknown.
              This is a particularly public health risk in densely settled, rapidly growing cities, such
              as the capital Kinshasa, which has recently suffered an unprecedented cholera
              outbreak. Decades of public inaction have seen the number of urban dwellers without
              improved sanitation rise from barely 6 million in 1975 to over 30 million today.



         Message 3: Break with decades of inaction in urban sanitation. A comprehensive solution to the
         urban sanitation problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo is unlikely in the medium term
         due to limited financing and absorption capacity. However, it is critical to lay the foundation for
         larger-scale future action by resolving institutional fragmentation and breaking with decades of
         public inaction. The new Water Law foresees a ministerial decree to fix “norms, responsibilities,
         and organization of the development, management, functioning, and financing of public
         sanitation.” This is an opportunity to re-order policy leadership, clearly assign implementation
         responsibility to municipal level, and pilot well-defined, replicable projects targeting a clear
         local impact and commencing a cycle of institutional and service improvement. Communication
         programs to better convey the health threat of unsafe WASH should be an integral part of any
         such pilots.




              Fact 3: Inequalities in WASH access persist between major cities,
              marginal urban areas, and rural zones.

              In the Democratic Republic of Congo, location is a critical determinant of improved
              water and sanitation access. The poor in major cities tend to have better access
              than the non-poor in marginal towns and rural areas. This is due to network effects,
              as well as the concentration of public investments on key agglomerations. While
              concentrating scarce resources can be efficient, a consequence is the perpetuation
              of the weakness of disadvantaged institutions and service areas. Improving the
              quality of supply in fast-growing major cities will remain critical, but achieving the
              universal access target of the SDGs will be impossible without a more balanced
              and effective approach in peri-urban areas, secondary towns, and the vast rural
              hinterlands.



         Message 4: In the urban WASH sector, seize the opportunity to leverage complementary
         investment channels that can help respond to the growing needs of an expanding urban
         population. The new Water Law not only supports the reform of the national utility with its
         emphasis on decentralization and cost recovery, but also allows underserved urban areas to
         be targeted more directly through alternative investment channels beyond REGIDESO. The law
         supports investments through decentralized provinces, allows delegated management models


xviii	                                                                     WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country
 with private or public operators, and recognizes user-managed autonomous schemes. This
 ends REGIDESO’s privileged legal position, heightens competitive pressure, and increases
 investment opportunities. Donors should provide support to piloting alternative, decentralized
 investment channels.

 Message 5: In the rural WASH sector, re-organize and strengthen provincial WASH departments.
 The EVA Program has reached up to 10 percent of the rural population with WASH interventions,
 but its NGO-driven implementation model has struggled to sustain its impact and scale up
 further. Sustainability has been a particular concern with up to 80 percent of intervention sites
 not maintaining the improved sanitation target at first revisit. To increase absorption and
 sustainability, local government institutions—now formally empowered through the Water
 Law—must build their capacity. In a country of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s size,
 a scale-up toward the SDG universal access targets cannot be realized without a sustained
 strengthening of local governments. This should be reinforced with better prioritization of
 intervention sites, continued cost control, a wider array of technologies (including small piped
 schemes where appropriate) and cross-sectoral interventions to achieve maximum impact at
 minimum costs.




       Fact 4: The new Water Law creates a legal basis for addressing
       long-standing institutional weaknesses.

       The new Water Law and associated Water Policy provide a specific legal framework
       for the WASH sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo for the first time. This
       framework gives a strong basis for major institutional reforms including a dedicated
       water ministry and regulatory authority, the decentralization of WASH investments,
       the separation of asset ownership and delegated service provision, the recognition
       of autonomous systems managed by user associations, and the principle of at-cost
       tariffs. This presents an opportunity to start addressing long-standing sector
       weaknesses, such as institutional fragmentation, over-centralization of service
       provision, lack of regulation, and the absence of cost recovery, which have constrained
       services.



 Message 6: Strengthen institutional ownership of the new Water Law to maintain its momentum.
 Implementing the new Water Law and Policy will require wide-ranging changes to an entrenched
 sector structure. This is difficult not only due the size, complexity, and inertia of the Democratic
 Republic of Congo’s vast state apparatus, but also the ongoing constitutional crisis that has
 diverted political energy away from ambitious reforms. To maintain the momentum of the law,
 a dedicated implementation unit should be supported within the Ministry of Energy and Water
 Resources. This unit should draw up concrete proposals to prepare the institutional
 reorganization, draft the decrees envisaged in the law, advise provincial governments and
 counterparts on its implications, mediate conflicts arising from its application, resist attempts
 to circumvent the law, support pilot investment projects in line with the law’s innovations, and
 act as core future water ministry and proto-regulator. The issue of water quality could be a
 natural first thematic focus.

 Introduction

 The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Poverty Diagnostic (WPD) in the Democratic Republic
 of the Congo is part of a global initiative with the objective of improving the evidence on
 the linkages between WASH and poverty, as well as identifying opportunities and bottlenecks
 in the sector. Following the structure of all WASH WPDs, this diagnostic aims to answer four
 core questions:

    •	 Who and where are the poor and bottom 40 percent of the national distribution
       (consumption)?

    •	 What is the level of access and quality of WASH services experienced by the poor and
       bottom 40 percent as compared to the non-poor and the top 60 percent?

    •	 What are the linkages and synergies between WASH and other sectors?

    •	 What are the WASH service-delivery constraints and potential solutions to improving
       services to the poor and bottom 40 percent?

 To answer these four core questions, the WPD has undertaken an unprecedented review of
 the existing literature and data (see appendix D for a list of surveys reviewed), complemented
 by in-depth original research. The WPD interviewed dozens of key sector stakeholders, held
 21 focus group discussions with men, women, and adolescents across the country, and carried
 out household surveys and water-quality testing in Kinshasa, the city of Kindu, and rural small
 towns in South Kivu and Equateur provinces. The WPD survey interviewed more than 6,000
 Congolese households and tested more than 3,500 water samples to obtain quantitative
 evidence linking household poverty, child anthropometric outcomes, and WASH access and
 quality for the first time in the Democratic Republic of Congo context.

 The methodological approach of the WPD stressed cross-sectoral links from the start, in
 particular with the health sector, due to the high relevance of health impacts of poor water,
 sanitation, and hygiene on long-term human development. The WPD worked with World Bank
 health teams in the Democratic Republic of Congo to collect additional data through health
 surveys in North and South Kivu, as well as an international team from the London School of
 Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), Overseas Development Institute (ODI), and University
 of Florida (UF) to develop new risk models. The outcomes of these collaborations are captured
 in chapter 3 and in the conclusions of the diagnostic.

 By answering the four core questions, the WPD aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of
 the current state of WASH in the Democratic Republic of Congo and strategies for improving
 outcomes, in particular for the poorest. As noted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a
 recent analysis, investment in the water and sanitation infrastructure of the Democratic
 Republic of Congo is a key channel for enhancing the inclusiveness of growth in the country
 (IMF 2015a). The service gaps in the WASH sector present a clear opportunity to improve the
 quality of life of the population in one of Africa’s most rapidly growing economies.

     As the ambitious new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim for universal access
     to safe water and sanitation, raise the bar for the WASH sector, the Democratic Republic of
     Congo exemplifies the breadth and depth of the challenge. The present report aims at providing
     a data-driven diagnostic to inform the way forward.

    •	 The Democratic Republic of Congo is among the five poorest countries in the world,
        whether measured by poverty rate or number of poor. The Democratic Republic of
        Congo is thus at the heart of the World Bank’s mission to end extreme poverty.

    •	 Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is a leading contributor to multidimensional
        poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    •	 Despite a slight improvement in poverty rates between 2005 and 2012, the total
        number of poor has increased by 7 million during the same period, towering to a total
        of 45 million.

    •	 Rapid demographic growth—the second highest in Africa—has driven the increase
        in the total number of poor and puts extreme pressure on the country’s derelict
        infrastructure.

    •	 A striking characteristic of the Democratic Republic of Congo is that poverty is
        almost as high in urban (62.5 percent) as in rural (64.9 percent) areas, and smaller
        cities tend to be much poorer than the largest cities of the Democratic Republic of
        Congo.

    •	 The pervasive nature of poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo confounds an
        easy prioritization of pro-poor interventions. The new Sustainable Development
        Goals (SDGs) aim for universal access to basic amenities such as WASH, which will
        pose a major challenge for the allocation of scarce resources in the short term and
        require unprecedented investments to achieve in the long term.




 The Democratic Republic of Congo has the third highest poverty rate in the world and
 concentrates the fifth largest number of poor people within its borders. Measured by the
 purchasing power parity adjusted international poverty line of USD 1.9 per day, only Burundi
 and Madagascar have a higher poverty rate (figure 2.1). More poor people live only in
 Bangladesh, China, India, and Nigeria (World Bank 2016b). The Democratic Republic of
 Congo is thus at the heart of the challenge to ending extreme poverty and boosting shared
 prosperity globally.

     The high and pervasive poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo manifests itself across
     the spectrum of human development. In spite of improvement over the past decades, the
     Democratic Republic of Congo continues to rank at the bottom of the United Nations (UN)
     Human Development Index and other indicators of multidimensional poverty (OPHI 2016).
     The Democratic Republic of Congo has particularly low life expectancy and high child mortality.
     Life expectancy in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains well below international
     comparison: 57.2 years for men in 2014 and 60.1 years for women (World Bank 2016c).
     While infant and under-five mortality declined, improvements fell short of the Democratic
     Republic of Congo’s Millennium Development Goal and mortality rates remain high at 5.8
     and 10.4 percent, respectively.


     Evolution of Poverty in the Democratic Republic of
     Congo Since 2005: The Scope of the Challenge
     Since 2005, the poverty rate has decreased slightly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but it
     remains among the highest in the world. The population living below the poverty line decreased
     by 5.3 percent (figure 2.2) since 2005 when measured relative to the national poverty line and
     adjusting prices for regional differences. This decrease in the poverty rate was more marked in
     rural areas (−5.6 percent) than urban areas in general (−4.1 percent) and the capital Kinshasa
     in particular (−3.5 percent), where poverty decreased less, but from a lower base. Both the
     intensity of poverty, as measured by the poverty gap, and inequality, as measured by the Gini
     coefficient, have also decreased slightly (figure 2.2).1 The share of the poor defined according
     to the international standard of individuals living below USD 1.90 per day declined from
     94.3 percent in 2005 to 76.9 percent in 2012.

     The relative political stability and gradual normalization of the security situation after 2002
     was the primary driver of this progress. The end of active warfare in much of the country and
     the election of a new national government in 2006 allowed the return of millions of internally
     displaced people, the revival of commercial and agricultural activity and resumption of some
     public services (IMF 2015, 5). An attractive macro-environment with high prices for Congolese
     mineral exports and sharply falling inflationary pressure supported high economic growth, as
     well as expanding government spending, up to 2014 (IMF 2015, 38; World Bank 2009, 9).

 A pronounced shift from low productivity subsistence agriculture toward industry and services
 reinforced the positive trend in poverty rates (IMF 2015b, 14).

 In spite of a decrease in the poverty rate, the number of poor people in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo actually increased significantly to 45 million due to rapid population growth.
 In 2012, 7 million more Congolese lived below the poverty line than in 2005. Indeed, while
 the poverty rate fell in most provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of
 poor increased everywhere except in Orientale and North Kivu. Although these regions
 remained affected by insecurity throughout the period under review, the fact that poverty did
 not increase could be attributed to a number of factors, including easier access to trade with
 and through Eastern Africa, revival of artisanal mining, the presence of large contingents of
 UN troops, and aid-funded nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

 The rise in the number of poor is driven by the second highest fertility rate in Africa. In 2015,
 the Democratic Republic of Congo had a total fertility rate of 6.6 children per woman, behind
 only Niger, and a population growth rate of 3.2 percent, undermining the per capita impact of
 the relatively fast, natural resource-driven GDP growth of 6.5 percent over the past decade.
 Fertility varies from 5.4 children per woman in urban areas to 7.3 in rural areas. Fertility also
 varies by province, from 4.2 in urban Kinshasa to 8.2 in Kasaï Occidental (map 2.1).

 The rapidly growing population and fast-paced urbanization add pressure to weak or nonexistent
 infrastructure, especially in the water and sanitation sector. The population in Democratic
 Republic of Congo is expected to more than double by 2050 and the Democratic Republic of
 Congo will be one of the nine countries contributing to half of the global population growth over
 2015–50 (UN 2015).2 This growth has direct implications in terms of infrastructure and service
 delivery in a country that is already experiencing a large infrastructure gap and struggling to
 deliver basic services.3 Urban population growth has been particularly overwhelming and
 largely unplanned. Over the past 20 years, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s cities have

     grown at 3.9 percent, almost twice the global average. The capital Kinshasa has grown at
     4.4 percent in the past 20 years and will remain among the continent’s three largest megacities
     by 2030 (UN 2014).

     In the face of this rapid population growth, achieving not just a reduction in poverty rate but in
     the total number of poor would require an even faster economic expansion or its more effective
     translation into opportunities for poorer Congolese. Un- and under-employment remain key
     sources of poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo, especially in urban areas, where low
     human capital and a business climate ranked among the worst in the world hinder the growth
     of businesses. While the mining sector has driven gross domestic product (GDP) growth, it has
     been less successful in terms of job creation and income generation. Capital intensive in
     nature, mining employs less than 8 percent of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s labor force
     even if artisanal workers are counted (IMF 2015, 18, 30).

     Looking toward the future, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s prospects of diversifying its
     economy and investing in human capital through education, health, and basic services such
     as  WASH, appear to be narrowing. Many of the key drivers of the Democratic Republic of
     Congo’s post-civil-war growth are under threat. Residual armed conflict continues to fester in
     eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and a constitutional crisis due to the delayed presidential
     election threatens the legitimacy of the government and broader peace. Prices for key exports
     of the Democratic Republic of Congo remain significantly below their levels in the early 2010s,
     putting pressure on the economy and government budget.

 Spatial Distribution of Poverty in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo
 Poverty is high across all former 11 provinces, none of which achieved a poverty rate below
 49 percent. While no clear provincial patterns emerge, the highest poverty rates tend to occur
 in the forested northwest and inaccessible central Democratic Republic of Congo, in particular
 Bandundu, Equateur, and the Kasais. Kinshasa has a lower poverty rate and inequality than
 most provinces, yet its large population also leads to a high absolute number of poor and by
 far the highest density of poverty (table 2.1).

 After the recent administrative reorganization into 26 smaller provinces, Kinshasa will be the
 province with the single highest absolute number of poor people: over 4 million (map 2.2).
 A similar combination of high numbers of poor people with comparatively low poverty rates
 occurs in the new Haut-Katanga province that is centered on Democratic Republic of Congo’s
 second city Lubumbashi, the Atlantic province Kongo Central, and the densely settled Kivu
 provinces in the east. By contrast, the new provinces of Kwilu and Lomami (map 2.2) are
 examples of areas with both high poverty rates and a high number of poor. Other provinces,
 such as Sankuru, are extremely poor but relatively sparsely settled.

 A striking characteristic of the Democratic Republic of Congo is that poverty is almost as high
 in urban (62.5 percent) as rural (64.9 percent) areas once differing price levels are adjusted
 for.4 The fact that most poor people still live in rural areas is thus not primarily caused by
 relatively higher rural poverty rates, but simply due to the still predominantly rural distribution
 of the population in general.

 While urban poverty is nearly as high as rural deprivation overall, urban poverty rates do differ
 by city size as shown in figure 2.3. While the poverty rate is comparatively low in the capital and
 megacity Kinshasa (53 percent), it is higher in other major cities (63 percent), and in excess
 of even rural poverty in more marginal, minor cities (81 percent).5 Even the lower poverty rate
 in Kinshasa still implies that more than half the capital’s population live in poverty, an
 extraordinarily high and growing number of poor people.

     This is an urbanization that “cannot be characterized as economically dense, connected, and
     livable” but is instead “crowded, disconnected, and costly for households and firms” (World Bank
     2016a, 33). The elevated urban poverty found in Congolese cities suggests these are examples
     of a “concentration of poverty rather than productivity” resulting from agglomeration due to a
     “push of rural instead of the pull of urban areas.” Congolese cities, especially the more
     marginal ones, exhibit high and entrenched poverty because “urbanization in labor-abundant,
     capital-deficient areas will not generate the same economic dynamism” as in areas where
     “labor and capital assets are more balanced” (Bryceson 2009).

 The spatial distribution of poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo poses a central
 challenge for the allocation of scarce resources. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 noted recently, in the Democratic Republic of Congo “the poorest provinces are not the
 prime recipient of public resources” (IMF 2015, 9). There are strong incentives and
 established dynamics favoring a prioritization of major urban centers, in which investments
 have comparatively high returns. Moreover, while poverty rates may be lower in major
 centers, the absolute number of poor is not only high, but densely concentrated and rapidly
 rising. Yet, neglecting rural areas and marginal towns risks perpetuating privation where it
 is most severe and, at least for now, most common. The pervasive nature of extreme
 poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo confounds an easy prioritization of pro-poor
 interventions.

 In response to this challenge of public resource allocation across space, the World Development
 Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography counseled a flexible mix of universal institutions,
 connective infrastructure, and spatially targeted measures to help countries manage an
 equitable transition toward a modern, connected, and productive society. In the area of basic
 infrastructure, such as WASH services, the report advised a “spatially blind” approach.
 Governments should provide basic “amenities […] to everyone, regardless of place” so that
 “people in the least fortunate places do not have to wait […] until their nations reach high
 income levels” (World Bank 2009). This recommendation is based not just on a moral argument
 for equity, but a conviction that universal access to basic services is the “bedrock […] of an
 effective integration” in which people are pulled to cities by agglomeration economies in an
 efficient manner, rather than pushed out of their rural homes “by the lack of schools, health
 services and public security” as is happening in many areas of the Democratic Republic of
 Congo (World Bank 2009).

 These insights give the new universal access targets of the UN SDGs an economic foundation,
 yet in the context of the Democratic Republic of Congo WASH sector such targets will remain
 illusory without a better understanding of the specific service constraints and underlying
 institutional bottlenecks in the provision of safe water and sanitation.

     resulting in a lower Gini coefficient than might be expected.
 2.	 The UN estimate that during 2015–50, half of the world’s population growth is to be
     concentrated in nine countries: India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo,

     contribution.

     the Logistics Performance Index in 2014 with only Somalia faring worse. Similarly,
     Democratic Republic of Congo’s electricity access rate (9 percent) is far below Sub-
     Saharan Africa’s average rate of 31 percent and there are significant disparities
     between urban and rural areas, where access rates reach just 1 percent. The current
     level of investments in cities is far below the amounts required to address the
     problems. A 2010 World Bank study of the urban sector estimated investment needs
     in urban areas at 16–17 percent of central government expenditures, or USD 12 per
     capita, three times the actual investment level.

     poverty rates than Kinshasa.

 Level and Quality of Water and
 Sanitation Access for the Poor

                                           Key Points

    •	 Access to improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services is low in
        the  Democratic Republic of Congo. Improved water facilities are available to
        52 percent of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s population, while less than
        29 percent have access to improved sanitation.
    •	 Rapid population growth has caused a large increase in the total number of Congolese
        lacking access to improved WASH services.
    •	 Access to improved water is much higher in urban (81 percent) than in rural areas
        (31 percent), but lower than it was in the 1990s, and wide access variations exist
        between major and marginal urban areas. The urban–rural gap is more compressed
        in sanitation due to low overall access.
    •	 In a context of pervasive service shortfalls, the poor in the Democratic Republic of
        Congo have significantly less access to improved water and sanitation. Among the
        almost two-thirds of Congolese living below the national poverty line, access to
        improved water and sanitation is almost 10 percent lower than among the non-poor,
        respectively.
    •	 The poor in larger urban agglomerations tend to have better WASH services but the
        challenges in urban areas—and particularly secondary urban agglomerations—are
        growing with urbanization.
    •	 Water quality is a major problem across urban and rural zones, and water source
        types. Surveys conducted by the Democratic Republic of Congo WASH Poverty
        Diagnostic (WPD) tested water quality at point of use for fecal matter contamination.
        The results show that contamination is shockingly common, even among households
        with access to piped water in major urban areas, with near universal contamination
        in the rural areas surveyed.
    •	 The overall picture is thus one of particularly dramatic WASH service shortfalls
        among the poorest and rural dwellers, but a pervasive lack of truly safe services
        even among wealthier and urban households.
    •	 The 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for WASH were missed by a wide
        margin. Given current trends and allocations, the even more demanding 2030 SDGs
        seem out of reach. The SDGs can nonetheless serve to inform policies and set
        priorities, particularly with respect to water quality.




WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                             11
      The Democratic Republic of Congo’s Hydrological
      Resources: Water Rich but Service Poor
      The Democratic Republic of Congo is defined by water, from the Congo basin that shapes
      its territory and gives it its name, to the important rainfall this tropical country receives.
      The Democratic Republic of Congo is extraordinarily blessed with water resources,
      possessing over 50 percent of Africa’s surface water reserves and almost a quarter of the
      continent’s internal renewable water resources (UNEP 2011). With annual average rainfall
      in excess of 1,500 millimeters (map 3.1), the Democratic Republic of Congo benefits from
      10 times the precipitation of countries such as Niger, and 50 percent more than neighbors
      such as Tanzania and Zambia (World Bank 2016). The daily volume of water the Congo
      River discharges into the Atlantic could supply all Congolese with sufficient water for
      seven years.1

      In spite of plentiful hydro-resources, access to safe drinking WASH remains low in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo, both in absolute terms and relative to regional averages.2
      Moreover, the past decades have seen few improvements, and in some aspects, even
      declines in WASH services. The poor have even less access to improved WASH services
      than the population in general, and this access inequality is reinforced by profound
      differences in services between the comparatively well supplied capital Kinshasa,
      disadvantaged secondary cities, and rural areas that lag even further behind.

 The Evolution of WASH Services: Modest Access
 Improvements Overpowered by Population Growth

 Low Access to Improved WASH
 Improved water facilities are available to 52 percent of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s
 population, less than 29 percent have access to improved sanitation and only 3 percent of
 households have handwashing facilities with soap (UNICEF and WHO 2015). Thus, even though
 improved water access is low, use of improved sanitation facilities is dramatically lower still.
 These access rates are substantially below the Sub-Saharan averages, and even compared to
 its nine direct neighbors,3 the Democratic Republic of Congo suffers from second lowest rate
 of improved water access and fourth lowest rate of sanitation access as map 3.2 illustrates
 (UNICEF and WHO 2015).


 Stagnating Service Expansion Failing a Growing Population
 Democratic Republic of Congo has made only “limited or no progress” and missed the 2015
 MDG of halving the population proportion without access to improved drinking water and basic
 sanitation. Access of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s population to both improved water
 and sanitation has risen by barely 3 percent since the first democratic elections in 2006, as
 outlined in figure 3.1.

 Moreover, rapid population growth has caused an increase in the total number of Congolese
 lacking access to safe water and sanitation facilities by more than a quarter since 2005 to over
 35 million and 53 million, respectively (World Bank 2016). As with poverty levels, minor
 advances in the percentage of access have been overwhelmed by population growth, leading
 to an increasing number of Congolese without safe water and sanitation facilities.


 Urban Versus Rural Access
 Access to improved water sources is much higher in urban areas than in rural zones:
 81  percent access in the former compared with only 31 percent in the latter (UNICEF and
 WHO  2015). This  urban–rural gap is one of the fundamental characteristics of improved

                                           water supply in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and reaching universal access targets
                                           under the SDGs will not be possible without improving supply not just in the rapidly growing
                                           cities, but the vast, remote rural hinterlands (map 3.3). In light of continued population
                                           growth, an expected 38 million rural dwellers will require access to reach universal improved
                                           water supply by 2030.4

 The access rate to improved water in cities remains lower than it was in the 1990s, though has
 recovered from its nadir at the end of the most intense phase of civil conflict in the mid−2000s.5
 Rural access had also declined during the conflict years, but recovered faster and now
 surpasses access rates of the 1990s.

 While access to improved water is overall much better in urban than rural areas, smaller towns
 are doing worse than larger cities. The capital and megacity Kinshasa has higher access to
 improved water in general, and piped water specifically, than other large cities (above 300,000
 inhabitants), and smaller towns lag still further behind (figure 3.2). In fact, Kinshasa’s
 performance is on par with that of other African capitals, but there is a significantly wider gap
 with other urban areas than in comparable countries (appendix B). The rapid growth of
 the urban population has also meant that in spite of a recent access rate improvement, the
 number of urban dwellers without improved access has increased by half a million in just the
 past eight years.6 To reach universal improved access by 2030, and taking into account
 expected urban population growth, an expected 26 million additional urban dwellers will
 require coverage.

 In the sanitation sector, access is lower overall and differences between urban and rural areas
 more compressed than in the water sector (figure 3.3). The long-term aggregate trend
 indicates nearly equivalent access rates of approximately 28.5 percent in urban and 28.7
 percent in rural areas, with a slightly negative urban trend and strongly positive rural access
 improvements over the past decade (UNICEF and WHO 2015). The latest available nationally
 representative survey qualifies the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) aggregate estimates,
 showing urban access still approximately 6 percent higher than rural access, though also
 reflecting a faster access increase in rural areas (2007 and 2014 DHS). Virtually all facilities
 are on-site as there are practically no functional sewer networks. Open defecation is
 significantly more common in rural areas, though remains below 20 percent even there.
 Differences between cities are less pronounced in sanitation than water access, though
 unimproved facilities appear to be more common in smaller towns.


 Provincial Outliers
 There are important disparities across provinces, most marked in the case of water access.
 In the eastern mountainous areas, such as North and South Kivu, water of relatively good
 quality is typically sourced from protected springs either directly (25.2 percent) or through

      local small networks with reservoirs and standpipes, contributing to very high piped access
      (47.7 percent). These provinces also have comparatively high supply of improved water for
      the poor (map 3.4). In the flatter, drier southern provinces, such as Katanga and Bandundu,
      water is typically taken from unprotected surface water (53.9 percent) or unprotected wells
      (8 percent) at significantly longer distances than in the rest of the Democratic Republic of
      Congo, with associated quality and gender issues. In the central forest areas, such as
      Equateur and Orientale, water is abundant with widespread use of unprotected surface water
      (59.8 percent) and protected springs (18 percent), but there are few improved sources
      overall (less than 33  percent) and thus widespread quality issues.7 Access to improved
      sanitation for the poor is universally low across provinces and districts, with particularly low
      values in the rural, forested areas of the northwest and central Democratic Republic of
      Congo.

      A number of geographic, climatic and historical factors explain the relatively better access to
      improved water in the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Historically, the
      eastern provinces have been a focus for water interventions since the late colonial period. The
      Belgian Indigenous Welfare Fund (Fonds du Bien-être Indigène, FBEI), set up in 1947, prioritized
      improving rural water supplies in the Rwanda-Burundi and Kivu-Maniema areas early on
      (Borgniez 1952, 4, 18; de Raeve 1997, 331). In peri-urban and urban areas, the national utility
      REGIDESO (Service National d’Hydraulique Rurale (National Rural Water Service) also engaged
      early prior to decolonialization (de Raeve 1997, 328).

      Following the demise of colonial institutions, the eastern region remained an area of active
      interventions in water supply, supported by local civil society organizations such as the
      Comité Anti-Bwaki, founded in the 1960s to fight malnutrition, the Institute Social Africaine
      supported by the Diocese of Bukavu in South Kivu, and, from the mid−1970s, the UNICEF
      Rural Water Program, which had its first operational base in North Kivu and later became
      the National Rural Water Service (SNHR). The region has also been a focal area of
      humanitarian interventions in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the past 20 years
      following the massive influx of refugees from Rwanda in 1994 and subsequent civil conflict
      in the region.

 Geographically, the eastern provinces are marked by mountainous terrain providing many
 opportunities for cost-effective gravity-powered piped water systems. Of 452 functional
 autonomous systems in the Democratic Republic of Congo, almost 60 percent were situated
 in the provinces of South Kivu, North Kivu, and Maniema (Tsitsikalis 2014). The eastern
 provinces close to the border with Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania, are also more
 accessible than central and northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo, facilitating
 construction and spare-part supplies.

                                        local community involvement combined with long-term interventions by aid-funded
                                        nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the acceptance of the need to pay, which is
                                        critical for systems requiring treatment or pumping.

                                        More Ambitious New Sector Targets
                                        Whereas the MDGs aimed to half the population without improved access by 2015, the new
                                        United Nations (UN) SDGs for 2030 set more complex and ambitious targets. In the new
                                        framework, technically “improved” water sources, such as covered wells or standpipes, which
                                        were the final target under the MDG framework, are merely the lowest of three tiers of water
                                        access. The second tier, “basic water,” requires the water source to not only be technically
                                        improved, but also be within 30 minutes of the household. The highest tier, “safely managed
                                        water,” refers to water sources that are not only technically improved, but on premises, readily
                                        available, and free of contamination. For sanitation, the new SDG Target Tier also goes beyond
                                        the prior MDG aim of non-shared improved facilities and in addition requires a handwashing
                                        facility with water and cleansing agent, as well as safe disposal of fecal matter. The SDG target
                                        is for universal access to the highest tiers of water and sanitation by 2030.

                                        The Democratic Republic of Congo missed the 2015 MDG targets, and access to even the
                                        lowest tier of improved water stands at barely half the population for water sources, and less
                                        than a third for sanitation facilities (map 3.2, figure 3.1). The situation is even more dramatic
                                        for the higher access tiers targeted by the SDGs. Figure 3.4 illustrates the difference between
                                        current levels of improved access to water and sanitation, basic water, and estimated safely
                                        managed water access, as well as comparing sanitation tiers. The relevant definitions are

 the SDG target indicator, are extremely rare. Fewer than 2 percent of households nationally
 have improved toilets and handwashing facilities. As there are presently no systematic services
 to safely dispose fecal matter in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the sanitation SDG target
 indicator is lower still. In other words, over 98 percent of households currently do not meet the
 SDG sanitation target. Basic water access is also significantly lower than improved access. For
 the highest SDG tier of safely managed water, even optimistic upper-bound estimates show
 very low current levels, barely 4 percent nationally (figure 3.4, with definitions in box 3.1).8

 The Democratic Republic of Congo WPD carried out representative field surveys, including
 water quality testing, in selected locations, providing an additional snapshot of access to the
 SDG target of safely managed water across a spectrum of specific urban and rural settlements
 (see appendix C for details on the survey design and methodology). Figure 3.5 gives the
 details of individual site results. Even in Kinshasa, safely managed water access barely reaches
 27 percent, and is virtually unheard of in other cities, towns, and rural hamlets. This underlines
 just how ambitious the SDG targets are in the Democratic Republic of Congo.


 Water Quality: A Universal Problem in the Democratic Republic
 of Congo
 Water supply infrastructure differs greatly between urban and rural study sites, but one issue cuts
 across and is a critical obstacle to safely managed access in the Democratic Republic of Congo:
 water quality. Across field study sites, very different water supply infrastructure was observed.

                                        While in remote rural hamlets in Equateur even improved sources, such as covered wells and
                                        protected springs, are lacking, some larger rural settlements, such as Tchonka in South Kivu,
                                        boast piped schemes and thus high improved and basic water access (figure 3.5). More typical
                                        are small towns, such as Basankusu in Equateur, and regional centers, such as Kindu, the
                                        capital of Maniema province, where substantial proportions of the population have access to
                                        improved sources, generally through a mix of covered wells, protected springs, and standposts
                                        from small piped schemes. Kinshasa stands out with its dense and widespread piped supply.
                                        In all cases, however, water quality is a major concern and key contributor to low safely managed
                                        access (figure 3.6).

                                        The WPD surveys tested water quality at point of use for E. coli bacteria, an indicator for fecal
                                        matter contamination, which can lead to “severe and sometimes life-threatening disease”9
                                        (WHO 2011, 124). The World Health Organization (WHO) set an objective of zero E. coli per
                                        100 milliliters of water as “the goal for all water supplies,” which “should be the target even in
                                        emergencies” (WHO 2008, 107).

                                        Point-of-use contamination with E. coli is shockingly common and cuts across location and
                                        supply technology (table 3.1). Even among households with access to piped water in the

 relatively well-served capital Kinshasa, more than a third of water samples were contaminated.
 More than half of water samples drawn from non-piped sources in Kinshasa were contaminated.
 In the city of Kindu, small hamlets in rural Equateur, and a cross-section of rural areas in South
 and North Kivu, E. coli contamination was even higher. While piped water sources tend to
 perform better, the problem of highly prevalent fecal contamination clearly cuts across location
 and technology. Even technologies that are commonly regarded as high quality, such as piped
 water, may not achieve positive health impacts if the water distributed is not properly treated,
 or if unhygienic storage and handling lead to recontamination prior to consumption.

 A high prevalence of point-of-use drinking water contamination is facilitated by very low levels
 of household treatment prior to consumption in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According
 to the latest DHS (2014), less than 2 percent of household with access to unimproved water
 sources treat their water in any way. For households relying on improved access, less than
 7 percent treat their water.

 The water quality and treatment data illustrates how unsafe even improved sources generally
 are in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As chapter 4 details, fecal contamination of water
 supply constitutes a major public health threat.


 Beyond Water Quality: Static or Deteriorating Service Quality
 While water quality is a priority concern both in terms of SDG targets and actual health impact,
 other measures of “access plus” also suggest static or deteriorating quality of access. Private
 water connections have become relatively rarer: in effect a downshift in quality of access that
 goes counter to the safely managed SDG target with its on-premises goal (figure 3.6). In fact,
 the slight increase in the overall access rate to improved sources seems to be driven by public
 piped sources, such as standposts and neighbors’ piped connections, partly at the expense
 of private connections. On a more positive note, surface-water sources, such as lakes, rivers,
 ponds, and canals, seem to have been gradually displaced by improved facilities.

 The time to water source, which is a critical part of the new SDG access definitions, has
 remained near constant at approximately 35 minutes after dropping slightly from 2001 to
 2007 (figure 3.7). In a comparison with 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, this is the seventh
 longest average fetch time, in spite of the relatively favorable hydrological conditions (Pickering
 and Davis 2012). To reach basic water targets of sources within 30 minutes fetch time,
 improving this parameter will be important.

      Access and trends in the type of sanitation facilities are concerning, in particular with respect to
      open defecation, handwashing, and the lack of a functional service chain for the safe disposal
      of fecal matter. Not only does unimproved sanitation continue to be widespread, but the
      percentage of Congolese practicing unhygienic open defecation appears to have increased
      over the past decade, rising from around 10–11 percent in 2001–07 to 12–13 percent in
      2012–15 (figure 3.8), though this remains moderate in regional comparison.

      The reversal in open defecation trends has not yet been reflected in the JMP trend estimates,
      and occurred despite a decade-long effort to reduce the practice through the Ecoles et Villages
      Assainis ([EVA] Healthy Schools and Villages) program.

      Handwashing with soap is also low—the fourth lowest among 29 African countries listed in the
      most recent 2015 JMP report—and has declined in recent years (figure 3.9), though data from
      the early 2000s is lacking.

      A further grave sanitation-related problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the widespread
      lack of a functional service chain for the safe disposal of fecal matter. There is no piped
      sewerage of scale, even in the largest cities of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and also no
      wastewater treatment. For the predominant on-site solutions, professional emptying and

 transport of accumulated fecal matter remains rare, and no safe public disposal or treatment
 sites exist. In other words, even improved latrines that safely contain fecal matter in the short
 term generally cannot be considered safe from a public health perspective, because
 accumulated fecal matter ultimately overflows or is emptied and unsafely dumped in unregulated
 disposal sites.

 Thus, not only is a limited increase in improved WASH access rates over the past decade
 being overpowered by population growth, but quality of access is at best static and by some
 measures deteriorating. Water quality, time to water source, on-premises access,
 handwashing with soap, open defecation, and safe disposal service chains for fecal matter
 constitute huge challenges far beyond the past MDG targets of improved access. Moving
 toward the more ambitious SDG targets will require enormous new efforts.


 WASH Access and Poverty

 Low Access for the Poor and Pervasive Service Shortfalls
 In a context of pervasive service shortfalls, the poor in the Democratic Republic of Congo have
 significantly less access to improved water and sanitation. Among the almost two-thirds of
 Congolese living below the national poverty line, access to improved water is only 48.9 percent,
 and improved sanitation facilities are available to only 16.6 percent; both values are
 approximately 9 percent below the access of the non-poor. As illustrated in table 3.2, access
 increases with household expenditure level, and higher-quality services are also more common
 among better off households. For instance, piped water on premises is three times more likely
 among the top 60 percent (T60) than it is among the bottom 40 percent (B40) of households
 by expenditure level.

 Notably, however, more than a quarter of the top 1 percent of households by expenditure
 level use unimproved water sources, and a majority use unimproved sanitation. This
 indicates that even among the better off, factors such as infrastructure constraints and
 cultural norms limit access to improved facilities. In other words, unsafe, low-quality access
 to water and sanitation services affects the poor more, but it is not a condition that is
 limited to the poorer sections of Congolese society. Instead, use of unimproved WASH
 services is pervasive across almost all expenditure groups in the Democratic Republic of
 Congo.

      Viewed from the perspective of asset wealth, an even more stratified picture emerges.10
      As table 3.3 highlights, access to improved water is more than 40 percent higher among the
      T60 than the B40. The top 10 percent by asset wealth have an access rate to improved water
      in excess of 95 percent.

      While access to improved sanitation is also more stratified when categorizing households by
      asset wealth rather than expenditure level, overall access remains lower and more compressed
      compared to water. Even among the top 10 percent by asset wealth, over 30 percent do not
      have improved (non-shared) toilets, again highlighting how pervasive sub-standard access to
      safe water and sanitation is in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

      To the extent that “access plus” indicators are available in existing data, these reinforce the
      evidence that the B40 have worse access to services. For example, less than 10 percent of the
      B40 have handwashing facilities, while twice as many of the T60 do. Less than 1 percent of
      the B40 treat water before use, while 6 percent of the top 60 do so. More than two-fifths of the
      B40 travel over 30 minutes for water compared to only one-third of the T60. At the national
      level, the inequality in improved access by expenditure level has persisted since 2005. In
      sanitation, access inequality even increased as the highest deciles pulled away from the rest
      (figure 3.10).

      The overall picture is thus one of particularly dramatic WASH service shortfalls among the
      poorest, but a pervasive lack of improved services even among higher expenditure and asset-
      rich households. Access to safe sanitation, in particular, is at dramatically low levels even
      among the richest top 10 percent of households. In the context of pervasive shortfalls,
      households below the poverty line are doing worse still. The B40 are significantly less likely to

 use improved WASH services, and less likely to use higher quality services, and this inequality
 has not improved since 2005, indeed, in sanitation it appears to have worsened.


 Better Services for Urban Poor
 The poor in larger urban agglomerations tend to have better WASH services. Inhabitants of
 larger cities tend to have better access to improved services than small-town and rural
 households at the same level of income. As figure 3.11 illustrates, near universal access
 to safe water in Kinshasa means households below the poverty line in the capital have
 higher access to improved water than households above the poverty line in other urban
 areas. In turn, poor households in urban areas have more access than non-poor rural
 households.

 A similar pattern is observed in sanitation, although the high prevalence of public toilets in
 Kinshasa (technically improved, but counted as unimproved by UNICEF and WHO [2015] due
 to sharing) means that the poor in other urban areas appear better served than in the capital.
 However, the poor in the capital and other urban areas also do significantly better in terms of
 improved sanitation than the rural non-poor.

 Rural areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo appear to be inherently disadvantaged in
 terms of WASH service access. The average rural dweller not only has fewer resources to afford
 improved facilities, but in more remote rural areas factors such as complicated logistics, fewer
 economies of scale, less knowledge, and weaker institutions negatively impact access
 independently of available household resources.

 For example, the national urban water utility REGIDESO is traditionally focused on service
 delivery in Kinshasa, where it is headquartered. This urban-centric service-delivery strategy
 was reinforced during the civil conflict of the 1990s and 2000s when many of the water supply
 systems outside the capital became dysfunctional. Today, 50 percent of REGIDESO’s sales
 points and 60 percent of its annual revenue are in Kinshasa alone and donor investments have
 tended to reinforce a focus on major cities (see chapter 5). By contrast, not only is there no
 comparable state institution organizing rural supply, but providing improved WASH to the thinly
 spread rural population across the vast Democratic Republic of Congo is also inherently
 difficult.

      Such inherent rural disadvantages—be they institutional or other—are clearly reflected in the
      statistics showing better access for urban poor than rural non-poor, and logistics regressions
      provide further evidence that location and poverty have separate access effects (appendix F).


      Trends by Location and Asset Wealth
      While overall progress in increasing access to improved services has been limited, trends
      have diverged significantly between different urban and rural areas and wealth groups.
      Concentrated investments in Kinshasa’s water supply appear to have consolidated and
      raised access to improved water in the capital to near universality over the past 15 years
      (figure 3.12), though as has been seen, service quality problems have persisted
      nevertheless (figure 3.5).11 A rebound in improved water access among the urban and rural
      B40 after the end of the most intense civil conflict seems to have given way to stagnation
      in the past 10 years. Instead, the rural T60 seem to have achieved better access over the
      past decade.

      By contrast, the low level stagnation of safe sanitation access appears to have affected urban
      and rural areas and various wealth groups similarly, with the potential exception of the rural
      B40, which witnessed an increase of 7 percent between 2007 and 2014, possibly due in part
      to the EVA Program (figure 3.13).


      WASH, Gender, and Children in the Democratic
      Republic of Congo
      No marked differences are observed in terms of access to water and sanitation by female-
      headed household, but water-related responsibilities continue to be primarily carried by women
      and girls. While female-headed households had greater access to improved water and lower
      access to sanitation in rural areas in 2007, leading to a similar gap at the national level, by
      2012 there is virtually no gender difference in terms of access to water and sanitation
      by  female-headed households, even when considering poverty and wealth distribution

 (see appendix F). On the other hand, a marked gender difference is seen when it comes to
 water-fetching responsibilities, with women and girls primarily carrying the load, reflecting
 social norms (figure 3.14). Beyond the time implication of this responsibility, tasks such as
 water fetching or walking to public toilets put women at risk of physical and sexual violence,
 which is prevalent in a fragile country such as Democratic Republic of Congo (Gonsalves,
 Kaplan, and Paltiel 2015; OHCHR 2014).12

      Conclusion
      A close analysis of the available data on WASH access in the Democratic Republic of Congo
      reveals a number of major policy challenges in view of the new universal SDG access targets.
      The majority of the population and vast majority of those lacking access to improved water
      remains rural. The question of rural access is closely linked to that of access for the poor,
      because it is the rural poor in particular who suffer from extremely low access to improved
      water, while the urban poor tend to profit from generally better supply in cities. Universal
      access, as targeted by the SDGs, will not be achieved without major efforts to improve water
      supply in rural areas where it has traditionally lagged.

      Although improved water access is overall higher in cities at present, it is eroding in the face of
      rapid urban population growth. In the next 15 years, urban areas are expected to add twice as
      many new inhabitants as rural areas (UN 2014). Major investments will be required simply to
      retain current access rates in cities.

      Urban areas are also characterized by large access inequalities between Kinshasa and other
      major cities and smaller urban agglomerations. In general, secondary and tertiary cities have
      significantly lower improved access and should be given more attention in light of their present
      disadvantage and rapid growth.

      Quality of access—in particular water quality—is a major concern that cuts across location and
      source types. As is recognized by the new SDGs, if human health and development are the
      ultimate aim, access to technically improved water is not meaningful if it is not easily available
      and truly safe to drink. Unfortunately, the available evidence suggests that improved sources
      are often located far from households, and contamination of water is extremely common both
      in urban and rural areas.

      Much of the urban water access advantage relative to rural areas vanishes once access is
      understood as water supply that is not only technically improved, but also close by and safe to
      drink. Results of the WPD survey in the provincial capital of Kindu illustrates this: Kindu has
      improved access of 84 percent, close to the average of urban improved access in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo. However, this drops to 56 percent for basic water, that is,
      improved water within 30 minutes of a household, and to below 1 percent for safely managed

 water as few households have continuously available sources on premises and fecal
 contamination is extremely widespread (figures 3.5 and 3.6). In terms of safely managed
 water, Kindu is thus not much different from remote rural hamlets in Equateur.

 A renewed focus on quality of supply by the SDGs may redirect attention to larger cities, which
 are less advanced in terms of service quality, as the earlier focus on improved water had
 suggested (figure 3.15). Moreover, cities tend to be easier to invest in due to stronger
 institutions, pre-existing infrastructure, easier access, and the more concentrated, rapidly
 growing population. Nevertheless, the rural access problem will persist and a major challenge
 for the coming years will be to prevent the gap between urban and rural areas in terms of
 access to safely managed water to become as large as it has for improved water. As over
 95 percent of Congolese currently lack safely managed access (figure 3.4), and taking into
 account rapid population growth, reaching the SDG targets by 2030 may require upgraded
 water sources for, by then, up to over 100 million Congolese (figure 3.15).

 In the sanitation sector, improved access is woefully inadequate in both urban and rural areas.
 A positive access trend in rural areas over the past decade has not reached a scale necessary
 to provide improved facilities to the majority of the population, and the particularly problematic
 practice of open defecation has stubbornly persisted and even increased. In the dense, rapidly
 expanding urban areas, an access rate stagnating below 30 percent is nothing short of a public
 health crisis, which, as chapter 5 will detail, the current institutional structure is unable to cope
 with. The shift toward a more qualitatively oriented definition of sanitation under the SDGs,
 which seeks to include handwashing and safe disposal of fecal matter, further increases the
 stakes. Fewer than 2 percent of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s population have access
 to the highest SDG sanitation tier. In light of this, the SDG target of universal access in just
 15 years is truly ambitious.

 This challenge is sobering, but as chapter 4 will outline, the enormous impacts of unsafe water
 and sanitation on health and human development only highlight the importance of achieving
 the SDGs, which should not only be a moral but an economic obligation for policy makers.

          hygienically separate human excreta from human contact.  While technically “improved”

          nevertheless provide contaminated water.

          still shows a negative trend for the past decade. However, individual surveys including DHS

          access rates that JMP has not yet reflected due to its particular methodological approach.

          E.coli and with less than a full day of interruption in the past two weeks in the best
          performing WPD survey site was applied, creating upper-bound national estimates.

          water as if they would pour themselves a glass to drink.
      10.	This is primarily because expenditures were adjusted by regional purchasing power, that is,
          effectively reweighted in favor of more rural and marginal areas in which a franc buys
          more than in more urban areas. Thus, for instance, the T60 by household expenditure is
          60 percent rural, whereas the T60 by asset wealth is only 47 percent rural. It is likely that
          the greater urbanity of the top deciles by wealth drives the higher service access.

          toilet in Khayelitsha, South Africa, which has an estimated 5,600 toilets in 800 separate
          locations. According to their study, the average round-trip travel distance to and from a
          toilet is 210 meters; at six trips per day and 2–5 minutes per trip, this suggests an assault
          risk exposure time of 15 minutes per woman per day. This results in 635 sexual assaults
          per year, creating USD 34 million in assault-related social costs.  The direct annual cost of
          operating the township’s toilets is USD 6 million, thus the combined annual social cost
          associated with the current allocation of toilets is USD 40 million. According to an April
          2014 report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
          (OHCHR) sexual violence remains “extremely serious due to its scale, systematic nature
          and the number of victims” (OHCHR 2014). With more than 40 percent of the B40 traveling
          over 30 minutes for water, this consideration of gender vulnerability induced by poor WASH
          is of primary importance in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

 WASH, Nutrition, and Health:
 The Foundations of Long-Term
 Development

                                           Key Points

    •	 A silent emergency to which water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) is a key contributing
        factor is placing Democratic Republic of Congo’s poor and rapidly growing population
        at risk of permanent disconnect: widespread malnutrition.

    •	 Malnutrition is particularly common among Democratic Republic of Congo’s children
        (43 percent in 2014) and has been shown to have irreversible negative effects on
        physical and cognitive development.

    •	 WASH is closely linked to malnutrition, stunting, and related health problems, such
        as diarrhea, ranking among the top five risk factors associated with death and
        disability in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    •	 New evidence by the WASH Poverty Diagnostic (WPD) demonstrates a significant
        reduction in the risk of anthropometric failure among children under five with access
        to uncontaminated safely managed water.

    •	 Food-security focused interventions have been estimated to address only 20 percent
        of the stunting burden. With WASH as one of the key contributing factors to
        malnutrition, the sector can play a key role in addressing the other 80 percent.

    •	 The nexus of WASH and nutrition highlights important priorities for policy makers:
         	 The new Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) focus on quality of WASH services
        °



           is of critical importance for what matters most: human health. Contaminated
           improved facilities are a part of the problem.

         	 Cross-sectoral interventions incorporating high-quality WASH along with factors
        °



           such as food security, maternal education, and natal care are likely to have most
           impact on health.

         	 Fail-safe interventions directly targeting water quality—for example, point-of-use
        °



           treatment—may help alleviate health impacts among the most vulnerable until
           infrastructure is in place.




WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                              33
      Malnutrition: A Silent Emergency
      Malnutrition in Democratic Republic of Congo is appallingly high for a country well endowed with
      natural resources. In spite of its vast and largely untapped arable land, combined with important
      water resources and a favorable climate allowing several annual harvests, food insecurity and
      malnutrition are rampant in Democratic Republic of Congo. The data from the latest national
      survey (Demographic and Health Survey [Enquête Démographique et de Santé] [DHS-EDS]
      2014) reveals that 49 percent of under five year olds in the Democratic Republic of Congo
      suffer from some type of anthropometric failure, with a staggering 43 percent chronically
      malnourished (figure 4.1).1 Close to 23 percent are severely and 8 percent acutely malnourished.

      Malnutrition in the Democratic Republic of Congo is pervasive across wealth quintiles, with only
      the richest doing significantly better. The prevalence of stunting in Democratic Republic of
      Congo is rather uniform across the wealth distribution with only the top quintile significantly
      less stunted than the other wealth groups. Notably, however, the poorest quintile was the only
      one to see stunting increase after 2007 (figure 4.2). The WPD survey showed just how
      widespread anxiety about nutrition is. Even in the capital Kinshasa, almost 60 percent of the
      non-poor had worried about not having enough to eat over the past 12 months, and over
      75 percent of the poor. In the provincial capital of Kindu, close to 73 percent of the non-poor
      had suffered the same anxiety, and over three-quarters of the poor.

 While child malnutrition is common across the Democratic Republic of Congo, important spatial
 variation can be observed. Stunting is more prevalent in rural than in urban settings (figure 4.2)
 and important spatial disparities exist between and within provinces. While under five stunting
 in Kinshasa is relatively low, at 15 percent in 2014, it towers at 53 percent in the North and
 South Kivu. The survey conducted by the WPD also documented important variations even at
 municipal level. While the capital’s central commune of Kinshasa has a stunting rate of only
 6 percent, up to 20 percent of under five year olds in the peri-urban commune of Kimbanseke
 are stunted.

 Malnutrition is an acute health risk and can also have long-term negative effects. Stunting is a
 powerful risk factor for disease and death and is associated with 53 percent of infectious
 disease-related deaths in developing countries (Schaible and Kaufmann 2007). The risk of
 dying is increased 1.6-fold in a moderately stunted child and by more than 4.1-fold in a severely
 stunted child (Black et al. 2008; Caulfield et al. 2004). Malnutrition can also have long-lasting
 negative physiological effects including “a reduced capacity for manual work […] poor mental
 development and school achievement as well as behavioral abnormalities” (Martins et al. 2011)
 and “even malabsorption of drugs needed to combat diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis, and
 malaria, which often coexist with malnutrition and diarrhea”(Guerrant et al. 2008). This risks
 long-term disadvantages for affected individuals, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s
 case of extremely widespread malnutrition, the country as a whole.


 The Link Between WASH, Health, and Malnutrition
 Concern about WASH lies at the very origin of the discipline of public health. John Snow’s
 famous discovery of a fecally contaminated well as the source of a major cholera outbreak in
 London in 1855 is often cited as the start of public health as a concern of public policy. Low-
 quality access to WASH has since been linked to many disease outcomes, including diarrhea,
 parasite infections, and malaria (Prüss-Ustün et al. 2014).

 The link between WASH and malnutrition has emerged as a particularly insidious one. Three
 biological mechanisms have been identified that link unsafe WASH to malnutrition and its
 negative health effects (Cumming and Cairncross 2016, 95):

    “(1) Via repeated bouts of diarrhea (Briend 1990; Checkley et al. 2008; Petri et al. 2008;
    Richard et al. 2013);
    (2) Soil-transmitted helminth infections […] (O’Lorcain and Holland 2000; Prüss-Üstün
    and Corvalán 2006; Hall et al. 2008; Ziegelbauer et al. 2012); and
    (3) A subclinical condition of the gut, referred to variously as tropical enteropathy (Baker
    and Mathan 1972; Humphrey 2009), environmental enteropathy (Fagundes-Neto et al.
    1984; Korpe and Petri 2012) or, most recently […] environmental enteric dysfunction
    (Crane, Jones, and Berkley 2015; Haghighi, Wolf, and Durie 1997; Humphrey 2009;
    Keusch et al. 2014).

 In each of these pathways, enteric pathogens and associated infections that inhibit nutritional
 uptake are transmitted through contaminated water and unsafe sanitation (see appendix G
 for the WASH–Nutrition pathways). Empirical research has demonstrated the link between
 WASH and health outcomes in the field both at village and cross-country level. Duflo (2015)
 and colleagues show that the provision of integrated water and sanitation improvement
 programs at the village level has a substantial impact on reducing the incidence of diarrhea
 in that village. Danaei et al. (2016) highlight unimproved sanitation as one of the leading risk
 factors for stunting in a cross-country study in 137 developing countries.

 Anemia—low levels of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that negatively impact child growth
 and development—is also related to poor WASH and reinforces direct malnutrition effects.
 Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) reinforces negative effects on cognitive development during
 infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and is associated with faltered growth


WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                   35
      (Soliman  2014) and malnutrition (Ngure et al. 2014). Anemia has been connected to
      WASH through the familiar pathways of environmental enteropathy and helminth
      infections, as well as the water-related disease malaria. Environmental enteropathy not
      only reduces nutritional uptake directly, but impairs hemoglobin production through
      inflammation effects (Ngure et al. 2014). Helminth parasites not only compete for
      nutrition, but contribute to anemia through blood loss, while malaria parasites destroy
      red blood cells directly. The incidence of anemia is high in Democratic Republic of Congo.
      In 2014, the rate of anemia in infants aged between 6 and 24 months was as high as
      43 percent, on par with that of stunting.2

      As would be expected based on known biological mechanisms and international evidence,
      unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene are closely related to under-five morbidity and mortality in
      the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indeed, WASH is one of the top five risk factors associated
      with death and disability in Democratic Republic of Congo (IHME 2015).3 According to the
      latest national survey (DHS-EDS 2014), diarrhea was the cause of 15 percent of deaths of
      under five year olds in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The same survey indicates that
      prevalence of diarrhea in children under five was close to 20 percent in an urban setting, and
      16 percent both nationally and in rural settings.4 While food insecurity is the leading factor,
      unsafe WASH access is a contributing risk that further weakens nutritional and health outcomes,
      and thus the foundations of early childhood development. As can be seen in figure 4.3, this
      risk is especially high in earlier years of life (years lived with disability, YLDs). The Democratic
      Republic of Congo is above the average for Africa in terms of disability-adjusted life years
      (DALYs) attributable to unsafe WASH.5

      Water contamination is found to be high in areas of high incidence of anthropometric failure in
      the Democratic Republic of Congo. The household survey and water quality testing done as
      part of the Democratic Republic of Congo WPD confirm a high level of E. coli contamination in
      areas with high anthropometric failure, in particular in provincial sites outside Kinshasa
      (figure 4.4 and table 4.1).6

      In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a reduction in the probability of anemia as well as malaria
      is consistently and significantly associated with improved access to water and sanitation
      (appendixes M, N, Q, R, and S). This result, based on national survey data (DHS-EDS 2014),
      shows that improving WASH in the Democratic Republic of Congo has a significant effect on
      anemia and its negative impact on child mortality and early childhood development, which
      aggravate similar effects stemming from malnutrition. While the results indicate a correlation
      rather than a causal pathway, it could suggest that improved water and sanitation facilities are
      likely reduce helminth and malaria infection by limiting water contamination by worms and
      mosquito larvae.



      Improved WASH Is Not Enough: The Importance of SDG WASH
      Targets for Nutrition and Health
      While improved WASH facilities significantly reduce the risk of anemia in the Democratic
      Republic of Congo, no statistically significant association between improved water and
      malnutrition itself is evident in recent national survey data (DHS-EDS 2013-14). Regression
      analysis using the 2014 DHS data shows the expected negative direction of the effect of
      improved water on the risk of stunting and other anthropometric failures (composite index
      of anthropometric failures, or CIAF), but the effect is not statistically significant, unlike
      other contributing factors such as the gender of the child (boys appear to be more
      exposed), the education of the mother, length of breastfeeding (in months), location (new
      provinces), and wealth7 (appendixes H, I, J, K, L). As outlined above, it appears that
      standard improved water sources significantly reduce anemia, possibly by limiting helminth
      and malaria infections, but do not protect significantly against fecal contamination related
      malnutrition.

                          This result is not surprising given the high rate of fecal contamination of improved water
                          sources demonstrated by the WPD survey and very low access to safely managed sanitation.
                          It is unlikely that improved water would significantly impact malnutrition if it is not, in fact,
                          free of fecal contaminants. Similarly, improved sanitation is unlikely to lead to strong positive
                          effects on malnutrition or properly protect improved water sources from contamination if
                          even households with improved facilities do not have access to safe disposal of the
                          temporarily contained sludge, if overall access levels are so low that cross-contamination
                          from other households is likely, and if handwashing with soap after toilet use is almost
                          unknown.

                          The insufficient protection improved water sources provide against malnutrition is aggravated
                          by the extremely low level of point-of-use water treatment, which has clear protective effects.
                          According to the latest DHS-EDS (2014), less than 2 percent of household with access to an
                          improved water source treat their water in any way. Only two provinces have treatment rates
                          over 4 percent (Kinshasa and Katanga), while the rest of the provinces hover between 1.0 and
                          3.8 percent. With the exception of Kinshasa, where boiling is the prevalent method of water
                          treatment. Treatment with bleach/chlorine is the preferred method of treatment in Democratic
                          Republic of Congo (figure 4.5).

 Looking at the correlation between CIAF or stunting and water treatment shows that all
 treatments, with the exception of letting the water settle, are associated with a reduction of
 anthropometric failures. Treatment by boiling and chlorine/bleach is most strongly associated
 with a negative correlation, in part due to their relative prevalence of use compared to the other
 techniques. Regardless of the age group considered, with any water treatment the odds of
 stunting/wasting/undernutrition are significantly lower (table 4.2). This confirms that renewed
 attention to water quality and water treatment, and the delivery mechanism and behaviors
 required for sustained and systematic use is warranted to address malnutrition in Democratic
 Republic of Congo, as long as the available infrastructure does not reliably deliver safe water
 and sanitation.

 While improved water is not enough to achieve significant protective effects, data collected
 by the WPD confirms that access to safely managed water (SDG tier 3) and improved
 sanitation reduce the probability of stunting and anthropometric failures by about 5 percent
 in children under 5.8 The household survey data collected in Kinshasa with water-quality
 testing confirm that access to truly safe WASH (that is, inclusive of the quality factor not
 accounted for in other surveys available) does significantly improve children’s nutritional

      status (appendix P).9 Access  to safely managed clean drinking water helps to reduce
      children’s probability of stunting by 4–5 percent on average, which is both economically and
      statistically significant. Access to improved sanitation also reduces the probability of
      anthropometric failures in the same range. Interestingly, household wealth does not seem
      to matter much, whether measured by a wealth index or an expenditure per capita measure
      based on the Survey of Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking (SWIFT) methodology.10,11
      Such results are indicative of the potential role of water quality as an equalizer. If safely
      managed, uncontaminated water can be made available, the probability of anthropometric
      failures in general, and stunting in particular, can be reduced regardless of poverty status.
      Although SDG targets for safely managed WASH are extremely ambitious, they are clearly a
      necessary step beyond improved access for the outcome that matters most: human health
      and development.


      Cross-Sectoral Interventions to Target the
      WASH–Malnutrition–Health Nexus
      Cross-sectoral interventions with safe WASH as an integral element will be critical to alleviate the
      malnutrition crisis that threatens the Democratic Republic of Congo’s future. The United Nations
      Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Synergy framework on malnutrition considers four key dimensions:
      food security, childcare practice, health, and WASH (that is, “adequate environment”).12 The
      fundamental idea is that substantial interactions and synergies exist among these dimensions.
      The Democratic Republic of Congo, survey data (DHS-EDS 2014) shows that 41 percent of
      children under 24 months have inadequate access to all four of these dimensions, with access
      to adequate WASH most lagging.

      The WPD’s analysis of the latest national data for the Democratic Republic of Congo shows how
      WASH interventions may enhance improvements in other key dimensions of the UNICEF
      framework (appendix V). While an average child with an adequate supply of food is only 0.5
      standard deviations (SD) taller than a child not adequate in any dimension, a child adequate in
      both food and care is 0.7 SD taller while child adequate in food and WASH/environment is 1.2
      SD taller.13 Indeed, for the bottom 40 percent of the wealth distribution (B40), access to food
      alone is not sufficient for a significant impact on height-for-age, but must be accompanied by
      access to another of the three dimensions. These results suggest that although in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo access to adequate food is of paramount importance in
      nutritional outcomes, particularly in poor households, meeting additional conditions such as
      safe WASH access is critical to achieving a statistically significant improvement in child height
      compared to no access. Including WASH in malnutrition interventions is thus critical in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo.

      Direct undernutrition interventions, even when scaled up to 90 percent coverage rates, have
      been estimated to address only 20 percent of the stunting burden (Bhutta et al. 2013). As
      one of the key complementary determinants of better nutrition outcomes, the water and
      sanitation sector can help address the other 80 percent. The latest Global Nutrition Report
      (IFPRI 2016) estimated the thresholds of a set of key determinants—water and sanitation
      along with calories, education, and female empowerment—which are needed to reduce
      stunting to 15 percent.14 These thresholds can serve as a starting point for countries to
      inform their targets and policies as well as to mobilize partners toward common goals across
      sectors.15 Table 4.3 presents the thresholds identified and gaps between thresholds needed
      to reach a predicted stunting rate of only 15 percent, and actual values in the case of the
      Democratic Republic of Congo.

      While the Democratic Republic of Congo has vulnerabilities across the six drivers, the gaps in
      access to improved water and sanitation are particularly wide. While food security (per capita
      calories in food supply) remains a major issue with a gap of 28 percentage points compared
      to the threshold, the gap in the area of water and sanitation are also wide. Countrywide,

 sanitation presents a gap of over 40 percentage points, while in rural areas the gap is important
 for both water and sanitation, respectively a gap of 36 and 44 percentage points, to reach a
 predicated stunting threshold of 15 percent. As noted in chapter 3, access to truly safe water
 is significantly lower still than data on improved WASH access suggests.

 Cross-sectoral approaches that include WASH in malnutrition interventions are increasingly
 piloted. One such example is the WASH in Nut (or WiN) program developed in the context of
 food-security emergencies in the Sahel region which targets nutrition/feeding centers and
 children suffering from severe malnutrition. Organized around a “minimum WASH package,”
 the WASH in Nut (or WiN) strategy is a tool targeting, in a specific and integrated way, mothers
 and severely malnourished children, from health infrastructure to communities.16 The WASH in
 Nut strategy is now endorsed in the Humanitarian Action Plans of eight countries in the Sahel
 and, more recently, by the Democratic Republic of Congo (WASH Cluster 2015).

 The strategy is being progressively extended to non-emergency approaches with the objective
 of  enhancing nutrition outcomes in countries with a high malnutrition burden. A further
 expansion linking this humanitarian approach to those undertaken in development could help
 achieve greater and more sustainable outcomes. If WASH is an underlying driver of nutrition,
 nutrition can also be a vector to improve WASH outcomes through other sectors and delivery
 mechanisms, particularly in hard-to-reach vulnerable populations in which single-sector
 interventions may not be cost-effective.

 Protecting the basics: WASH interventions targeting nutrition and health must place particular
 emphasis on ensuring high water quality efficiently. Building infrastructure that can deliver truly
 clean water and a fully safe sanitation chain is a long-term project. In the short run, “fail-safe”
 stop-gap interventions, such as treatment at point of use, may also be considered as part of
 nutrition-focused projects, especially in vulnerable areas in which high-quality infrastructure is
 not yet cost-effective. Evidence suggests that point-of-use treatment can achieve take-up rates
 of up to 70 percent and reduce child diarrhea by 20–40 percent (Arnold and Colford 2007;
 Clasen and Edmondson 2006; Fewtrell et al. 2005; Kremer, Ahuja, and Zwane 2010; Sobsey
 2002; Waddington and Snilvsteit 2009). Such interventions may also minimize recontamination
 in the home, a well-known cause of water quality degradation even in the best-case scenario of
 access to clean piped water. While not sufficient alone, point-of-use water treatment can be a
 cost-efficient WASH intervention to protect key nutritional outcomes in under-five-year-old
 children, thereby protecting Democratic Republic of Congo’s richness, that is, its people and
 potential for shared prosperity.17

      Cross-sectoral nutrition- and health-focused interventions that integrate WASH should
      balance cost-effectiveness with a focus on severity of needs, which are concentrated in
      certain provinces. From a needs perspective, risk to children’s health is particularly
      high  in Equateur, Orientale, Kasaï Oriental, Kasaï Occidental, and South Kivu. A new
      WASH Poverty Risk Model (PRM) developed in the context of this diagnostic combines
      key “susceptible factors” and “exposure factors” most relevant to the incidence of
      diarrhea. A description of PRM and main results can be found in appendix X.18 The PRM
      analysis shows that while all children in all regions would benefit from water and
      sanitation improvement, children from the provinces of Equateur, Orientale, Kasaï
      Oriental, Kasaï Occidental, and South Kivu would experience the highest heath risk
      reduction in response to water or sanitation access improvements. (See map 4.1 for a
      map on improvement in water and appendix X for those related to sanitation.) As Box 4.1
      further highlights, the factors influencing malnutrition risks are complex and may also
      vary with local factors at the sub-province level such as closeness to mining sites or
      political violence.


      Implications of the WASH–Nutrition Nexus for
      Policy Makers
      The nexus of WASH and nutrition highlights important lessons for policy makers. First, the new
      SDG focus on the quality of WASH services is of critical importance to address the major
      health problem of WASH-related diarrhea and malnutrition. Contaminated improved facilities
      are part of the problem, contributing to acute and long-term negative health effects in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo. Fail-safe interventions directly targeting water quality, such as
      point-of-use treatment, may help alleviate health impacts among the most vulnerable until
      adequate infrastructure is in place. Second, cross-sectoral interventions incorporating high-
      quality WASH along with factors such as food security, maternal education, and natal care are
      likely to have most impact on health. Finally, a careful analysis of risk factors can help direct
      interventions to areas of highest impact.

       Box 4.1: The Complex Influences on WASH Quality and Nutrition: Fragility and Mining

       The quality of water and degree of malnutrition are influenced by a complex array of factors, not always at
       household level. The impact of political violence and economic activity are important examples.

       Fragility remains an issue with lasting implications in the Democratic Republic of Congo, including for public health.
       The effects of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s protracted instability extend beyond the direct casualties of
       organized violence, and include many less visible consequences. Using the data from the Armed Conflict Location
       and Event Data Project (ACLED), different variables were constructed to capture the incidence of violence.a The
       results show that the distance from the closest headquarters of an armed group is positively correlated with
       anemia and malaria, meaning that children living closer to armed groups face a significantly higher likelihood of
       being anemic or suffering from malaria. The results are not significant for stunting or anthropometric failures
       (appendix Q).b While this analysis captures only a small aspect of the overall tragedy of political violence in the
       Democratic Republic of Congo, it indicates how state fragility can impact and complicate public health crises.

       The importance of mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s economy is another factor affecting water quality
       and malnutrition in many areas of the country. Democratic Republic of Congo is a resource-rich country and mining
       represents a sizable and growing share of the country’s GDP.c In a context of low governance, this economic
       bounty has faced little environmental regulation and monitoring. In a 2011 report, UNEP estimated that around
       15 tons of mercury are used annually in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s artisanal gold mining operations, the
       second largest source of mercury emissions in Africa (UNEP 2011). This is of particular concern for populations
       relying on unprotected water sources. While no data exists on the contamination resulting from mining activities,
       we used a dataset on the localization of mining permits granted by the Congolese government to proxy for mining
       sites.d Map T.1 in appendix T shows the proximity of these sites to rivers in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

       The results show that stunting is indeed higher in areas close to mining activity (appendix T). Controlling for
       other key variables (wealth, mother education, gender, breastfeeding, and others), close to 50 percent of
       children under five living in household less than 5 kilometers from a mining site are stunted, whereas children
       living further from such sites are comparatively less stunted (below 40 percent). Children under five living
       closest to mining sites also tend to have less access to improved sanitation and are less likely to have
       access to improved, basic, and safely managed water than children residing further away. While these results
       fall short of proving a direct relationship between unsafe mining and malnutrition, they do indicate the
       existence of negative socioeconomic and environmental dynamics impacting nutrition (appendixes T and U).
       The reliance by poor populations on unsafe natural resource extraction combined with the persisting gap in
       access to improved WASH infrastructure exemplifies the extreme vulnerability of those populations to
       additional contamination of their water resources, warranting further attention and research to expand on the
       anecdotal evidence already flagging this concern.e
       a. Using the ACLED database, several conflict/violence variables are constructed namely: number of strategic events (battles, strategic development
       and non-violent transfer of territories) within a 10–50 kilometer radius; the number of events with violence against civilians within a 10–50 kilometer
       radius; the number of the strategic events with fatalities; and the number of the civilian events with fatalities. The variables are defined as the number
       of events in the 12 months prior to the beginning of the survey and the five years prior to the beginning of the survey. The correlations among the
       variables are high. Additionally a variable using the distance to the closest military headquarters is included in the analysis.
       b. Other variables, such as the number of events with facilities, are less stable across specifications. For instance, taking a quantile perspective, the
       younger age group 6–23 months), the three lower quantiles of height (20th, 40th, and 60th) show a positive correlation with the number of events
       with fatalities in the prior five years within a 10 kilometer radius. With military action endogenous, one of the possible reasons could be that relatively
       better-off areas are more desirable targets for warring factions (see appendixes 16–18 for all results).
       c. Mining production accelerated from 2007 onward and mining exports more than doubled between 2009 and 2014. Mining and oil represented 97
       percent of the country’s exports and 33 percent of GDP in 2014. Mining is only one of the extractive and forest-based activities with potential implications
       for water quality. We focus on mining due to its visibility, important contribution to Democratic Republic of Congo’s growth, and data availability.
       d. It is possible, however, that some concessions have remained unexploited.

WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                                                                                   43
      Notes
      1.	 Stunting and the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failures (CIAF) are used to capture
          the overall extent of undernutrition among children. Stunting is a cumulative measure of
          both acute and chronic undernutrition and tends not to vary instantaneously in response
          to acute conditions, such as diarrhea or measles. This makes it a preferred indicator of
          aggregated deprivation over time. The composite index of anthropometric failure (CIAF) has
          been proposed (Svedberg 2000) and used (Nandy et al. 2005) to provide an unequivocal
          statement on the direction and degree of change in undernutrition over time which is
          useful in a context of high vulnerability, such as Democratic Republic of Congo. CIAF allows
          the analysis to systematically capture the different combinations of anthropometric failures
          (that is, including wasting and underweight in addition to stunting). Still, stunting is the
          main contributor to CIAF in Democratic Republic of Congo and captures more than 80
          percent of children with anthropometric failures.
      2.	 Anemia testing is only conducted for children aged 6–59 months.
      3.	 The risks by cause analysis looks at the total burden of deaths by risk factor and how risk
          factors affect 21 broad cause groups. Data used to estimate cause-specific mortality for
          the 2013 Global Burden of Disease come from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies,
          maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14,244 site-years
          (years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013. Data from 35,620
          epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases. Cause-
          specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble
          Model strategy Global Burden of Disease Pediatrics Collaboration (2016).
      4.	 The indicator capture the incidence of diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey in
          children below 59 months of age.
      5.	 YLD is an abbreviation for years lived with disability, which can also be described as years
          lived in less than ideal health. This includes conditions that may last for only a few days or
          a lifetime. It is measured by taking the prevalence of the condition multiplied by the
          disability weight for that condition. Disability weights reflect the severity of different
          conditions and are developed through surveys of the general public. DALY stands for
          disability-adjusted life year. It is a metric that allows researchers and policymakers to
          compare different populations and health conditions across time. DALYs equal the sum of
          years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). One DALY equals one lost
          year of healthy life. DALYs allow the estimation of the total number of years lost due to
          specific causes and risk factors at the country, regional, and global levels (IHME).
      6.	 Interestingly, while stunting is high, wasting and underweight are lower, even in areas of
          high contamination (table 4.1). This could suggest that while children suffer from regular
          food insecurity and shortfalls (as reflected by the high number of respondents worried
          about not having enough to eat, see above), they are not suffering from acute malnutrition.
          Rather, high stunting reflects an aggregated effect of inadequate dietary intake and
          infectious diseases over time that reduce metabolic requirements and increase nutrient
          loss, compounded by the effects of poor water quality and unsafe sanitation. A separate
          paper on issues related to nutrition, WASH and poverty will expand the analysis using the
          Democratic Republic of Congo WPD survey data.
      7.	 A typical DHS Wealth Index excluding the WASH variables is used.
      8.	 Safely managed water refers to a definition of access that is improved, on premises,
          continuous and E. coli free. The water testing at point of use was conducted for a sub-
          sample of households interviewed for the Democratic Republic of Congo WPD.
      9.	 Limitation in data in the case of Kinshasa prevented the inclusion of breastfeeding and
          mother education in the regression analysis. Other control variables used in the previous
          analysis of DHS data were included. The analysis will be expanded to the other sites
          covered by the Democratic Republic of Congo WPD survey where the missing controls are
          available.
      10.	While the wealth index is significant—reducing the probability of stunting/anthropometric
          failure as expected—in some specifications, coefficients are very small when this is the
          case.

 11.	 Developed by the World Bank, SWIFT stands for Survey of Well-being via Instant and
      Frequent Tracking. SWIFT collects data from samples that are representative of underlying
      populations of interest. SWIFT applies a series of formulas/algorithms, as well as the
      latest ITS technology, to cut the time and cost of data collection and poverty estimation.
      For example, SWIFT does not estimate poverty from consumption or income data, which
      is time-consuming to collect, but uses formulas to estimate poverty from poverty
      correlates, which can be easily collected. The 2012 LSMS for Democratic Republic of
      Congo was used to define the variables required to relate poverty estimates to the
      expenditure based measurement; that is, to define imputed log per capita expenditure.
 12.	 The adequate environment (WASH) measure is based on adjusted definitions adopted by
      WHO/UNICEF JMP as part of the monitoring of the SDGs. They include components
      on:  access to improved drinking water;  access to improved sanitation;  adequate
      handwashing practices; and adequate disposal of child’s feces. Given that it is not only
      the child’s immediate environment, that is, the facilities in the dwelling unit, but also
      those in the immediate neighborhood which affect the degree of exposure to pathogens,
      community-wide access to improved sanitation is also explored. Further details on the
      econometric model and definition used can be found in appendix V.
 13.	 The coefficient estimate for food and environment is based on only 11 observations (0.4
      percent of the sample), but the food and health estimate is based on 74 observations
      (2.4 percent of the sample). That is, the average height-for-age z score (HAZ) for children
      with access to food and health is 0.4 SD.
 14.	 This 15 percent stunting cutoff is arbitrary but does correspond to the approximate
      stunting prevalence in 2015 for 100 million stunted children, the World Health Assembly
      (WHA) target for stunting in 2025 (IFPRI 2014).
 15.	 The underlying driver thresholds are calculated by fitting a line to a cross-plot of stunting
      and each of the underlying drivers using data from all countries that have available data
      for all six underlying drivers. The threshold for, say, available calories per person per day
      is determined by the calorie level above which we would estimate a stunting rate, on
      average, of less than 15 percent (2,850 calories). This is done for all six underlying
      drivers. In total, 98 countries were included in the definition of those thresholds, including
      Democratic Republic of Congo (IFPRI 2016).
 	    Note: Several studies provide estimates that link stunting to a range of underlying drivers.
      Smith and Haddad (2015) analyzed variation across a number of countries over time,
      while Headey and Hoddinott (2014) and Headey (forth­      coming) analyzed variation within a
      given country over time.
 16.	 The strategy is centered on mainstreaming a WASH “minimum package” in humanitarian
      programs. This strategy recommends three main groups of activities: improving WASH
      conditions in nutrition centers and reducing the risks of nosocomial infection among
      children who receive treatment; providing a hygiene kit and giving advice to families in
      order to improve treatment and reduce risks of relapse; improving the WASH environment
      in communities at risk of undernutrition to prevent new cases (Regional WASH Working
      Group 2012). The WASH in Nut strategy was developed over several years after the
      2005 food crisis, but received a “push” from the crisis in 2011–12 and was then
      formalized.
 17.	 While no recent study on the cost effectiveness of water treatment exists, a WHO/UNICEF
      study postulates that household water treatment can pay back USD 60 for every USD 1
      invested (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme 2005).
 18.	 A self-standing report on the Poverty Risk Model (PRM) analysis for Democratic Republic
      of Congo is also part of the delivery package of the Democratic Republic of Congo WPD.
      The relative risks are not estimated in each setting due to insufficient context-specific
      literature for the various model parameters, but national level data is used to inform the
      model. This approach is consistent with conventional burden of disease analyses. WASH
      exposure factors include household access to water, sanitation, community sanitation
      coverage, and hygiene; susceptibility factors include whether the child in underweight,
      received vitamin A and Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) in the case of diarrhea. Further
      details on the model can be found in appendix X.

 WASH Service-Delivery
 Constraints and Potential
 Solutions

                                             Key Points

    •	 A new Water Law and an associated Water Policy (2015/16) provide momentum
        and a legal basis to address long-standing institutional weaknesses in the water,
        sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
    •	 In  a context of state fragility and poor governance, three major institutional
        weaknesses have plagued the sector: institutional fragmentation, weak capacity,
        and a bias toward specific institutions and services. These general challenges have
        manifested differently across subsectors:
        °°   At national policy level, sector leadership has split between seven ministries,
             reducing the efficiency and coherence of policy making and implementation.
        °°   In urban water, the public utility (the National Urban Water Distribution Agency,
             [REGIDESO]) has struggled to reform, achieve cost recovery, and expand beyond
             its historic service centers. Alternative supply models have been slow to develop.
             Urban access has thus eroded overall and inequality between major and minor
             cities persisted.
        °°   In urban sanitation, a decades-long vicious cycle of weak, fragmented institutions
             and no investments has led to a lack of any public services for the rapidly growing
             urban population.
        °°   In rural WASH, institutional fragmentation and weak capacity has been partly
             compensated by a major, decade-long donor-financed program implemented
             by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To scale up and sustain its impact,
             however, more effective involvement of provincial governments will be needed.
        °°   A cross-cutting service gap arising from these institutional weaknesses has been
             widespread contamination of drinking water with fecal bacteria across urban and
             rural areas.
    •	 The impact of the new Water Law and Policy on these institutional challenges is
        potentially profound:
        °°   A dedicated water ministry, regulator and re-ordering of the sanitation sector
             could decisively reduce fragmentation and provide stronger leadership on issues
             such as water quality.
        °°   The principle of at-cost tariffs could improve cost recovery at REGIDESO and
             other providers.

             °°   Investments in marginal urban areas could be boosted by the law’s support for
                  decentralization, delegated management, and autonomous systems.
             °°   Decentralization of responsibility for WASH could strengthen local government
                  participation.

        •	 The core challenge will be to maintain momentum and transform these opportunities
             into real change in the face of an entrenched sector structure and precarious political
             climate.




      The Legal Framework: A New Water Law
      For decades the Democratic Republic of Congo lacked a specific law governing the water and
      sanitation sector (Landu 2010, 22; WSP 2011b). This changed with the promulgation of the
      new Water Law on December 31, 2015. The new Water Law sets out a legal and institutional
      framework for the WASH sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo in line with the decentralizing
      thrust of the 2006 Constitution. Implementing the new Water Law will require broad-ranging
      and complex reforms to adapt the currently centralized, fragmented, biased, and ineffective
      institutional structure to its vision of a decentralized, coherent, and more evenly balanced
      WASH sector.

      The Constitution outlines the distribution of responsibilities in the WASH sector. It assigns
      exclusive responsibility for national planning, the conservation of natural resources, and
      legislation on hygiene to the central government (Article 201, §33 and §36e/h). In contrast,
      the provinces are given exclusive responsibility for the organization of public services (Article
      204, §10) and production of water (Article 204, §26). Overlap is introduced by shared
      responsibilities, which include the vaguely defined management of water and forests (Article
      203, §16), hydrology programs (Article 203, §11) and the prevention of epidemics (Article 203,
      §17). Ultimately, the central government remains predominant as Article 205 renders null and
      void any provincial laws not in line with national legislation.

      The new Water Law follows the Constitution’s guidance by centralizing WASH policy making and
      regulation and decentralizing asset ownership and service provision. The law gives central
      government the power to set the national water policy (Articles 12 and 71), to regroup
      responsibilities for public water services under a single water ministry with wide-ranging powers
      over policy, standard setting, and financial support of rural water services (Article 15), as well
      as a regulatory authority to monitor norms and set tariffs (Article 75). Provincial governments,
      local authorities, or user associations are assigned the role of asset owner (Articles 72–73),
      are responsible for investments (Article 76) and required to delegate service provision to
      public or private entities (Article 78), which are to charge cost-based tariffs. These are major
      changes that will be difficult to implement as the sector has been notoriously fragmented,
      asset ownership and investment decisions have been concentrated in central agencies, such
      as the national utility REGIDESO, alternative providers have not been recognized, and below-
      cost provision has been the norm.

      The Water Law does address the sanitation sector in 8 of its 126 Articles, confirming core
      principles, but leaving a detailed specification of responsibilities to a future ministerial decree.
      The law confirms the principles of decentralized asset ownership and delegated management
      for public sanitation (Article 96), and allows for a role of provincial and local governments. Yet
      the distribution of responsibilities is not detailed and no regulatory authority or single ministerial
      body is foreseen to give coherence to the fragmented subsector structure. At least, the
      potential for significant change is contained in the law, with Article 97 referring to a future
      ministerial decree to resolve these wide-ranging issues.

 A National Water Policy has been drafted by the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and
 aims to translate the provisions of the law into actionable policy.1 The policy (Politique Nationale
 du Service Public de l’Eau, PNSPE) specifies the law’s provisions, detailing the responsibilities
 at the various levels of government, recommending service options for urban, peri-urban, and
 rural areas, and outlining the future of sector agencies. The policy reiterates the unification of
 the water agenda in one ministry, foresees the transfer of the National Rural Water Service
 (SNHR) from the Ministry of Rural Development to the new Water Ministry, and calls for the
 assets of the urban utility REGIDESO to be transferred to the provinces, with the once
 monopolistic state utility becoming a delegated service provider “like any other” (MEWR 2016).

 By contrast, the law’s vagueness about sanitation is matched by uncertainty at the policy level.
 In 2013, the Directorate of Hygiene in the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) issued the National
 Sanitation Policy (PONA), and the Ministry of Environment, Conservation of Nature and Durable
 Development (MECNDD) issued the National Basic Sanitation and Hygiene Policy (PNHAB).
 While the former is ostensibly focused on collective and the latter on household sanitation,
 there are numerous overlaps (see table 5.5) and the two ministries are in a barely concealed
 rivalry. Neither of the policies has been implemented substantially in practice.

 A major challenge confronting the water sector today is the practical implementation of the
 promising new law and policy in the face of an entrenched sector structure. In the sanitation
 sector, the new law is less clear about core issues such as the distribution of responsibility,
 thus not yet providing a clear basis for the reform of the sanitation sector. Ministerial decrees
 will be required to fill in the details.


 The Present Institutional Structure and Its
 Major Weaknesses
 The new Water Law’s impact on the institutional structure is potentially profound. It could
 improve coherence and reduce fragmentation, creating one sector ministry, one regulator, and
 a clear distribution of responsibilities between central and decentralized levels, as well as
 providing guidance on the future role of key institutions such as the national utility REGIDESO.

 Yet, to date, the law’s provisions remain largely on paper and the institutional structure of the
 Democratic Republic of Congo’s WASH sector continues to be characterized by three interlinked
 challenges: a strong degree of institutional fragmentation, major capacity gaps, especially at
 decentralized level, and a strong bias toward specific institutions and thus particular types of
 services. The delay in the law’s implementation has been due not only to the size, complexity,
 and inertia of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s vast state apparatus, but also the 2016
 constitutional crisis of presidential succession that has diverted political energy away from
 ambitious reforms.


 Institutional Fragmentation
 The WASH sector remains highly fragmented, split between seven ministries, as well as the
 former state monopoly for urban water provision REGIDESO (table 5.1). This fragmentation
 reduces the efficiency and coherence of policy making and implementation by dividing related
 tasks over multiple ministries. For instance, overall water policy rests with the Ministry of
 Energy and Water Resources (MEWR), but rural water issues are still assigned to the Ministry
 of Rural Development, the urban utility is owned by the Ministry of Portfolio and operates largely
 independently, and sector coordination is formally led by the National WASH Action Committee
 (CNAEHA) within the Ministry of Planning. No single agency is in the position to monitor the
 evolution of the sector or to carry out capacity for overall sector planning and coordination

 Not only are responsibilities divided, but in many cases, they are also not clearly defined or
 overlapping. For instance, broad responsibilities over the sanitation agenda are claimed by the

      MECNDD as well as the MPH. Both ministries have issued sanitation policies that are formally
      distinct but effectively overlap, which is further complicated by the Ministry of Infrastructure
      which also has responsibility for urban drainage and sanitation infrastructure. Competition for
      scarce finance encourages duplication and lack of coordination as agencies strive to extend
      their funding sources, thus entrenching fragmentation.


      Capacity Gaps
      A second major challenge in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s WASH sector are capacity
      gaps, especially at decentralized level. A 2011 report of the World Bank-administered Water and
      Sanitation Program (WSP) noted “the lack of capacity to effectively disburse funds and
      implement projects at scale” as the “key constraint” in the WASH sector. After decades of
      political conflict, lack of capacity has become a feature of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s
      socioeconomic structure, affecting the WASH sector not only directly, but indirectly through a
      “lack of supporting infrastructure, logistics, and economic services” (WSP 2011a, 9).

      Even long-standing, operationally minded institutions such as the public utility REGIDESO and
      National Rural Water Service (SNHR) “suffer from a serious shortage of qualified personnel”
      (UNEP 2011, 23). These sector capacity gaps are particularly grave in institutions that do not
      have WASH as primary focus (for example, MECNDD) and at the decentralized, provincial level.
      This is a critical problem as the Constitution and new Water Law shift important responsibilities,
      such as asset ownership and service delegation, to the decentralized level where underresourced
      and inexperienced local administrations struggle to cope.

      The unfinished decentralization process has aggravated capacity gaps. The 2006 Constitution
      defined the Democratic Republic of Congo as a unitary, but decentralized state, and the number
      of provinces has increased from 11 to 26, yet the decentralization agenda remains incomplete
      (figure 5.1). Provincial revenues have consistently been below the constitutionally mandated
      share, and national ministries have continued to intervene directly at provincial level. Along
      with the weak institutional capacity and limited accountability of provincial authorities, this has
      contributed to impeding the delivery of basic services and diminished the benefits of
      decentralization.

      Capacity is particularly low in newly created provinces without established administrative
      centers. For instance, the new province of Tshuapa, which extends across a land-area three
      times the size of Switzerland, is to be administered from the new provincial capital Boende,
      situated in remote territory hundreds of kilometers from the previous province’s capital. The
      creation of effective administrations in these new provincial capitals has not progressed far.
      As the PNSPE puts it, “today, few provinces and decentralized entities dispose of the technical
      and financial capacities to assume this role of managing the water needs of the population
      effectively” (MEWR 2016, 15).

      Funding and Service Bias
      The third major institutional challenge in the WASH sector is the strong bias of the limited
      availability of finance toward particular institutions and thus specific types of services. In an
      overall divided, underresourced, and low-capacity sector, investments have predominantly
      focused on just two institutional channels: the urban water utility REGIDESO and the “Healthy
      Schools and Villages” (Ecoles et Villages Assainis [EVA]) program, which is led by the United
      Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the MPH. The vast majority of funds over the past
      decade has been absorbed by REGIDESO and the EVA program (figure 5.2).2

      The concentration of funding has been driven by external financing. In the past, approximately
      90 percent of sector investments have been externally funded (WSP 2011b, 21–31).
      In 2015, the government allocated USD 13 million to the sector (Ministère du Budget 2015)
      compared to approximately USD 85 million by donors.3

                                           Concentrating sparse funds in this manner has a strong justification: If a key problem is sector
                                           fragmentation and absorption capacity, and given almost universally high needs, the
                                           concentration of funding on established institutions and major cities can be seen as a rational
                                           choice of donors and policy makers seeking maximum impact by working with the relatively
                                           best-equipped counterparts in accessible locations.

                                           A consequence of this strategy, however, is a focus on subsectors and geographic areas that are
                                           already better served, and a perpetuation of the weakness of disadvantaged institutions and
                                           service areas. The urban sanitation sector has particularly suffered from this self-reinforcing
                                           effect by which institutional weakness discourages funding, which in turn perpetuates
                                           institutional weakness. As figure 5.2 illustrates, minimal funding has been directed at urban
                                           sanitation even though improved sanitation access is less than half of improved water access
                                           in urban areas, and the public health threat at least as high as in rural areas.

                                           Funding bias effects are also at play within subsectors and institutions. Most importantly, the
                                           strategy of the national water utility REGIDESO’s has been to prioritize reform and the restoration
                                           of its financial position through a focus on its traditionally strongest service areas in Kinshasa,
                                           Lubumbashi, and Matadi, and within these centers, on richer, more central neighborhoods. In the
                                           capital, for instance, 48.7 percent of households in the central, well-off commune of Kinshasa
                                           have access to safely managed water (the top Sustainable Development Goal [SDG] tier) while only
                                           1.2 percent in the poor commune of Kisenso do (WASH Poverty Diagnostic [WPD] survey 2016).


                                           Governance and State Fragility
                                           Weak governance is abetted by institutional fragmentation, capacity gaps, and service biases
                                           that disrupt accountability relationships, thus contributing to weak services, especially for the
                                           poor (World Bank 2004). Splintered sector institutions lead to diffuse responsibilities making
                                           it more difficult for citizens to effectively voice demands to the state. Providers that
                                           either  enjoy  near-monopolies (for example, traditionally REGIDESO) or are largely absent

 (for example, in urban sanitation), tend to be difficult to call to account by clients or even policy
 makers. Capacity gaps further undermine providers’ ability to act accountably.

 WASH governance and thus services are also hampered by more general constraints associated
 with state fragility. As the World Development Report 2004 (WDR) noted, when “governments
 do not run well, they cannot sustain the institutional arrangements and accountability
 relationships that yield good services” (World Bank 2004). The Democratic Republic of Congo
 has suffered from a long history of colonial exploitation and post-colonial misrule during which
 “corruption and patronage became established as socially accepted cornerstones of the
 Congolese political tradition” (Matti 2010, 48). Corruption “remains widespread and is taking
 a heavy toll on public service capacity to deliver key services” (World Bank 2013). In
 Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, the Democratic Republic of Congo
 was among the 20 worst performing countries in 2015. Even “at the central level, public
 institutions have been shattered by decades of neglect, mismanagement, corruption and war”
 (World Bank 2016c, 1). The development of institutions at decentralized level was inhibited
 because “the central government dominated the execution of power during both the colonial
 [period] and the second republic” (World Bank 2016c, 1).

 The decentralization called for by the Water Law has the potential to bring sector agencies into
 closer proximity to the people they are meant to serve. This, however, would require that priority
 be given to developing and funding processes for effective and accountable local service
 provision, which are largely inexistent today, even if it may initially bring heightened
 implementation risks. A realistic approach to such reforms will have to take the political
 economy incentives of sector actors into account if it is to be successful (for example,
 competition for control of funding sources).

 Governance and political economy issues loom over every aspect of the WASH sector. They
 are a key factor in the low performance and capacity gaps outlined above, as well as more
 specific problems, such as procurement risks and high overhead costs, that bedevil projects
 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While there is no easy solution to the existing
 sociopolitical disincentives to effective collective action, addressing the underlying
 institutional-reform needs cannot be avoided. As the WDR put it, “if organizational failures
 are the result of deeper weaknesses in institutional arrangements […] direct attacks on the
 proximate determinants (more money, better training, more internal information) will fail”
 (World Bank 2004, 58).

 Institutional fragmentation, capacity gaps, service biases, and governance are general
 challenges in the WASH sector, yet manifest differently across urban and rural areas and water
 and sanitation. The following sections will provide a more detailed subsector analysis to
 pinpoint service bottlenecks, especially for the poor, and then conclude by identifying possible
 next steps and recommendations.


 Urban Water: In the Shadow of REGIDESO
 The urban water sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo appears to have performed
 relatively well at first glance. Improved access is above 80 percent of the urban population
 and funding has been far in excess of finance available for the rural or sanitation sector
 (table 5.2).

 Yet, a closer look reveals a more problematic picture. The total number of urban dwellers
 without access has been rising rapidly over the past decade, precipitated by rapid population
 growth. The quality of supply has stagnated at low levels or even deteriorated. As detailed in
 chapter 2, there has been a marked shift from piped on premises to less convenient public
 sources, and pollution of water with dangerous fecal matter is widespread. Urban access
 remains stratified by income and particularly by location, with Kinshasa and other major
 cities having better access than marginal urban areas.

      While the current urban population without improved access is below 5 million, over 25 million
      presently lack safely managed services targeted by the new SDGs, and taking into account
      expected urban growth, almost 50 million will require safely managed coverage by 2030 to
      reach the SDG universal access target.

      These trends and inequalities are directly related to the institutional structure of the urban
      water sector. The former monopolistic urban water utility REGIDESO has continued to
      dominate the urban water subsector and has been the near exclusive recipient of investment
      funding over the past decade (figure 5.2). Yet, REGIDESO has struggled to achieve financial
      sustainability, keep up with demand in its core centers, and extend services to more marginal
      urban areas.

      In the urban water sector, the funding and service bias resulting from the incomplete rehabilitation
      of REGIDESO is the most pressing institutional problem. While REGIDESO has successfully
      expanded access in core cities, the population has expanded even faster, service quality
      remains unsatisfactory and full cost recovery has remained elusive. The utility’s strategy to
      prioritize investments in core cities to create profit centers that could then finance service
      expansion in more marginal urban areas has not yet succeeded and effectively created a
      structural bias against peri-urban zones and minor cities.

      The new Water Law and SDGs are an opportunity to not only accelerate REGIDESO’s reform,
      but to target underserved urban areas more directly through alternative investment
      channels. While investments centered on REGIDESO will remain critical to cover the rapidly
      growing population in Democratic Republic of Congo’s major cities, the new Water Law has
      ended its monopoly and created a legal basis to work directly with provinces and alternative
      autonomous operators to target peri-urban areas and marginal cities more directly. Across
      approaches, however, it is clear that service quality and, in particular, the prevention of
      currently widespread water contamination must become a new priority across the entire
      urban sector.

      The next subsection aims to give a concise overview of the historic context, institutional
      structure, and constraints in urban water, complemented by recommendations for next steps
      in the conclusion of this chapter.

 Historical Context: The Rise and Decline of REGIDESO
 Urban water supply in the Democratic Republic of Congo has long been dominated by the
 national utility REGIDESO. While it has lost its former monopoly, it remains the only public entity
 in the water sector with a national presence, structured organization, significant technical
 capacity, and the ability to generate large revenues. Its entrenched, yet weak, position explains
 many existing service biases and bottlenecks in urban water, and its future role under the new
 Water Law will be critical in determining whether the urban population, and the poor in particular,
 will benefit from improved services.

 REGIDESO was established by Royal Order in 1933 by the colonial government. At the time,
 there were five existing urban water distribution stations in Congo. Expansion of the
 urban  water supply began in earnest after World War II. In 1953, REGIDESO supplied
 17 cities with 18 million cubic meters of water (Borgniez 1954, 3) and, by 1959, urban
 supply had been expanded to 48 cities, distributing 35 million cubic meters of drinking
 water annually along 3,700 kilometers of pipelines (de Raeve 1997, 328). After
 independence from Belgium in 1960, REGIDESO became a state-owned enterprise with a
 monopoly in urban water supply.4 The company was operated in a strictly centralized
 manner, with all critical administrative, financial, and technical functions based in
 Kinshasa. By 1974, REGIDESO was supplying 55 urban centers and 125,000 private
 connections with water. During the early 1970s the company achieved a small surplus or
 broke even on its operations with government and donors financing capital investments
 (WHO and IBRD 1974).

 In the 1980s REGIDESO continued to expand its services and was still considered one of the
 most successful African water utilities. The utility eventually supplied 94 out of the then 164
 agglomerations above 5,000 inhabitants (Landu 2010, 22, 32). However, the accelerating
 decline of the Congolese economy and deterioration of the sociopolitical environment toward
 the end of the Mobutu regime in the 1990s, as well as the subsequent civil war, precipitated
 the downfall of the company.

 In the wake of the Second Congo War in the early 2000s, 34 REGIDESO centers were fully out
 of service, and the performance of those still in operation had greatly deteriorated (World Bank
 2008). Access to piped water in urban areas had halved from 1990, water production fell to
 239 million cubic meters per year (versus a peak capacity of 375 million), non-revenue water
 rose to 39 percent, only 49 percent of bills issued were collected, and operating costs reached
 166 percent of revenues (Kamanda 2009; Tribeche 2015, 15; World Bank 2008, 2–3).

 REGIDESO’s diminished financial performance was driven by an average tariff below production
 cost, overstaffing, high energy costs, fraud encouraged by weak controls and political interference,
 and the non-payment of water bills by state institutions. The latter accounted for 43 percent of
 REGIDESO’s billings in the mid−2000s (World Bank 2008). The decline of REGIDESO occurred
 in a period of rapid population growth and urbanization, which heightened the service crisis.
 The population of Kinshasa alone rose from 1.5 million in 1975, to 3.6 million in 1990,
 6.1 million in 2000, and 11.6 million in 2015 (UN 2014).


 Institutional Constraints in Urban Water: REGIDESO’s Difficult
 Reform and Structural Bias
 The rehabilitation of REGIDESO has been at the center of efforts to improve urban water supply
 since the return of a fragile peace in 2003. Following a number of multi-sector emergency
 interventions that restored strategic parts of the existing piped water infrastructure, the World
 Bank took the lead in launching a comprehensive urban water sector reform and infrastructure
 investment project centered on REGIDESO, the so-called “Programme de Redressement.”
 The  International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group supported this

      endeavor with an original grant of USD 190 million in 2009, and additional financing of USD
      166 million in 2016. Labeled Projet d’Alimentation en Eau Potable en Milieu Urbain (PEMU), it
      is the single biggest investment in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s WASH sector today.

      The PEMU project anticipated three phases to progressively extend water supply from the urban
      centers to the margins. The first phase aimed to restore REGIDESO’s financial equilibrium
      through a private operator–driven internal reform combined with infrastructure investments
      focused on the three most established and profitable service centers (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi,
      and Matadi). To achieve profitability in these core centers, the reform aimed to improve revenue
      collection and reduce overstaffing.

      It was planned that once financial equilibrium was restored, the second and third phases would
      expand service improvements to the next largest (Kisangani, Bukavu, Likasi) and finally all
      REGIDESO centers by 2020. More marginal centers would be rehabilitated “using cash
      generated in the profitable centers through a cross-subsidy” (World Bank 2008, 38). Eventually,
      the project foresaw that “in the medium to long term urban water supply services in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo will have to be decentralized and may eventually be entrusted
      to independent regional utilities” (World Bank 2008, 39). The project has since made progress
      in Phase 1, but failed to attain the more ambitious Phases 2 and 3.

      Over the past seven years, this flagship reform program has had a positive impact on the utility
      and water services, in particular in the three core urban centers. Facilitated by major donor
      investments, a strong increase in active connections (+24.4 percent), water production
      (+29.9 percent), and metering rate (+20 percent) was achieved, as well as a cost recovery ratio
      that is now closer to break-even. The legal status of REGIDESO was changed from a state
      enterprise to a commercial firm in 2010. Though it remains fully owned by the Congolese state,
      key management positions were contracted out to a private firm in 2014 under a services
      contract that is linked to a performance contract with the government.

      These improvements have come at a high cost, however, and key financial and performance
      targets have remained elusive. Project disbursements on hardware alone amounted to over
      USD 3,600 per connection made, over USD 630 per household member gaining access, and
      over USD 140 per beneficiary.5

      As table 5.3 illustrates, the utility has also lagged on key financial and performance targets and
      continues to perform worse than its peers in the region. Non-revenue water has remained
      stubbornly above 40 percent and the bill collection rate around 70 percent, compared to
      project targets of 29 percent and 97 percent respectively. Moreover, despite the significant
      growth in water production, the population within REGIDESO’s perimeter has grown faster still.
      The fact that REGIDESO has struggled to keep up with population growth is reflected in an over
      20 percent decrease in piped on-premises access in urban areas since 2000 (UNICEF and
      WHO 2015).

      Despite the reduction of staff per 1,000 connections, achieved largely through an expensive
      World Bank-financed retrenchment program, it remains far above its peers and, perversely, the
      cost of staff as a percentage of sales has gone up. This was largely due to “uncontrolled
      increases of the remaining staff’s remuneration” at the very time that the utility was pursuing
      a financial turn-around (World Bank 2016b, 43). The retrenchment disproportionately affected
      technical supervisors and operational staff, and shifted the staff mix toward older, increasingly
      generously rewarded management (Tribeche 2015, 20).

      REGIDESO’s financial rehabilitation has also been undermined by the difficulty encountered in
      getting state institutions to pay official water bills. As of late 2015, public arrears amounted to
      close to CGF 85 billion (approximately USD 75 million). The refusal to pay public water bills is
      effectively subsidized by donor grants and creates a major gap in REGIDESO’s finances as public
      institutions still constitute 22 percent of billings (World Bank 2016b). This is illustrative of the
      only partial political commitment to reforming REGIDESO, which is also reflected in the nature of

 of REGIDESO in the hands of political appointees with limited accountability (Tribeche 2015, 32).

 Struggling to achieve financial viability and to keep up with population growth, REGIDESO has
 remained focused on its core centers, and the initial vision of a gradual expansion of investments
 to all 94 service centers and eventual creation of independent regional utilities has remained
 elusive. In fact, the administration of the utility has moved toward greater centralization with a
 recent consolidation of revenue and expenditure flows and associated disempowerment of
 provincial departments (World Bank 2016b, 43). While a complementary project financed by
 the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) has targeted secondary cities in selected provinces,
 it has struggled to win greater autonomy for provincial departments, and service provision and
 management attention has remained highly concentrated on major centers.

 By 2014, out of now 97 formal REGIDESO centers, 60 percent of all sales points were located
 in just the “Top 3” REGIDESO cities of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Matadi, generating 75 percent
 of revenues. The “Top 18” centers, shown in map 5.1, generated 95 percent of sales (REGIDESO
 2015). As the map illustrates by displaying other administrative centers in the country, this
 service concentration bypasses urban water supply in many of the more marginal towns of
 the Democratic Republic of Congo, thus leading to the access differentiation in urban areas.
 Moreover, even within its major centers, REGIDESO services tend to be concentrated in
 wealthier districts in line with the historical location of its infrastructure and its revenue
 maximization strategy. In Kinshasa, the WPD survey showed REGIDESO access above 90
 percent in core communes such as Kinshasa, Makala, and N’Djili, but barely 50 percent in poor
 communes, such as Kisenso.

 The concentration of funding on REGIDESO highlighted in figure 5.2 has been important to
 restoring and improving services in rapidly growing major cities, but the strategy of coupling
 improvements in core cities to service amelioration in the decentralized provinces and marginal
 urban areas has not come to fruition. REGIDESO has retained a highly centralized administration
 and structural bias toward major centers, and even within these has been slow to expand

      services to poorer peri-urban areas in line with its revenue maximization strategy. The almost
      exclusive concentration of finance on REGIDESO has thus also entrenched service inequalities
      in urban water.

      Service inequalities related to the REGIDESO’s strategic priorities have been reinforced by
      operational decisions. REGIDESO’s tariff schedule, for instance, has been regressive as the
      average price of water from standposts was up to four times more expensive than for private
      connections (FINAGESTION 2014, 11; REGIDESO 2015, 5) and initial connection costs
      have  been high. Laudable attempts to expand standposts have not yet reached significant
      scale. In 2014 there were only 1,600 functional REGIDESO standposts across the country
      and fewer than 100 in Kinshasa (Tsitsikalis and Prie 2014). There is presently no coherent
      standpost strategy across REGIDESO centers and, in many cases, household connections are
      converted to public standposts to increase short-term revenues.

      REGIDESO has started to address some of these challenges. In particular, the utility has
      committed to a progressive tariff reform and incipient social connections program. Ultimately,
      however, such operational measures can only improve services where REGIDESO has an
      operational presence. As long as its structural service bias toward major cities persists, more
      comprehensive, pro-poor services will be constrained.

 While investments through REGIDESO will remain critical to cover the rapidly growing urban
 populations in major centers, these investments need to be complemented by alternative
 approaches where REGIDESO does not reach effectively. After a decade of focusing almost
 solely on major centers and the failure to achieve the original vision of a decentralized
 REGIDESO, complementary investment channels are needed to help correct structural service
 gaps. The new Water Law has created the legal basis for such complementary approaches by
 shifting asset ownership and responsibility for service delegation to provinces, and allowing
 the possibility of third-party private, public, or user-managed operators.


 The Rise of Autonomous Water Supply Schemes: A Pro-Poor
 Alternative?
 As REGIDESO has struggled to extend services over the past decades, autonomous water supply
 schemes have risen to become a critical part of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s urban water
 infrastructure, in particular for the poor in peri-urban areas, small towns, and densely populated
 rural areas. Independently run piped systems today meet the needs of millions of Congolese
 in the gap REGIDESO has left, and which point-sources and other alternatives could not fill. As
 figure 5.3 illustrates, the rise of urban autonomous schemes appears to have coincided with
 the surge in demand during the period of REGIDESO’s decline and rapid urbanization since the
 fall of the Mobutu regime in the late 1990s.

 By late 2014, some 520 autonomous networks existed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, of
 which approximately 80 serve urban households in peri-urban expansion zones of cities
 (Tsitsikalis 2014, 21). Urban schemes have been expanding particularly rapidly since 2007,
 funded by external partners and supported by local NGOs. In Kinshasa alone, more than 40
 autonomous schemes today supply an estimated 500,000 people with water, a number
 expected to double by 2018 through an investment program financed by the French Development
 Agency (Bédécarrats 2016).

WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                                   65
      Autonomous schemes are important pro-poor suppliers of water in urban areas, because they
      have been disproportionately set up in impoverished peripheral neighborhoods that lack
      REGIDESO supply. Prices tend to be higher than REGIDESO, but lower than available alternatives,
      such as bottled water. In Kinshasa, the cubic meter price in autonomous schemes is
      approximately USD 2.1 per cubic meter compared to USD 0.35 per cubic meter for REGIDESO
      private subscribers and USD 1.54 per cubic meter for the small number of REGIDESO
      standpipes (Bédécarrats 2016, 10).

      These prices generally allow autonomous schemes to achieve full cost recovery (Bédécarrats
      2016, 10). By contrast, REGIDESO sells to private consumers at a loss (FINAGESTION 2014),
      which contributes to its structural deficit, low-quality service, and inability to reach more of
      the steadily growing urban consumer base. Moreover, the typical model of discrete per-volume
      pricing at standposts also suits many poor households with limited and unstable incomes
      better than REGIDESO’s model of monthly bills.

      Autonomous schemes are particularly common in Eastern Congo, and in the peri-urban areas
      of large agglomerations such as Kinshasa, Lubumbashi-Likasi and Mbuji-Mayi (map 5.2). While
      in mountainous Eastern Congo, rural gravity schemes providing unmetered water to private
      connections are predominant, the (peri-) urban schemes of southern, central, and western
      Democratic Republic of Congo have different characteristics.

      Typically, peri-urban schemes “operate with a 100−150m deep borehole […] a generator-
      powered submersible pump, an elevated reservoir, offices and distribution pipes supplying
      from 10 to 45 standpipes as well as connections for schools and health centers. Each system
      is designed to supply from 10,000 to as many as 40,000 people” (Bédécarrats 2016, 2).

 One reason for the growth of autonomous schemes is relatively low investment costs, which
 have been estimated at approximately USD 35–50 per beneficiary compared to over USD 140
 in recent REGIDESO projects. However, services offered by urban autonomous schemes are
 typically more limited. As peri-urban schemes primarily supply via standposts, average
 consumption has been estimated at just 6 liters per capita per day.

 The majority of autonomous systems (more than 80 percent) are administered by local community
 structures (Tsitsikalis 2014). In peri-urban areas, a popular model has been dubbed “ASUREP”
 (in French, Association des Usagers des Réseaux d’Eau Potable; in English, the Users Association
 of Drinking Water Networks). Each ASUREP administers one piped scheme and is an independent
 non-profit organization under Congolese law. Strong local ownership is achieved by an elected
 general assembly that oversees an elected board, which in turn recruits a management team
 locally. The ASUREPs are organized in an incipient federation (Fédération des associations des
 réseaux d’eau potable, FEDASU), which aims to represent the ASUREP’s interests and provide
 technical support services. At present, however, primary technical assistance is still provided by
 the (externally funded) NGO, Action Développement et Intégration Régionale (ADIR) in the cities
 of Kinshasa and Mbuji-Mayi. It has had a key role in setting up ASUREPs, monitoring their
 performance, and intervening directly, if necessary. A similar role has been played by other
 NGOs across the country.

 While this autonomous system model has been locally successful, challenges remain. First,
 upfront investment costs and crucial technical support through NGOs, such as ADIR and
 others, remain reliant on external support. While this is typical for the Democratic Republic of
 Congo’s water sector as a whole, it does raise the question of how the model could be scaled
 up and how sustainable it will be.

 A second issue is the relatively high running costs that arise from expensive energy and the
 lack of economies of scale. This is problematic as it may make the ASUREP model less
 suitable in areas of the country that are poorer than Kinshasa, and lack its high, accessible
 water table. While 9 out of 13 autonomous schemes constructed five years ago by the Belgian
 Development Assistance in South Kivu and Maniema are still functional (CTB/DGCD 2016), a
 DfID funded autonomous systems pilot in Mbuji-Mayi was considered a failure with only 4 of 11
 systems functioning at the point of project closure (DfID 2012).

 A final risk to autonomous schemes is their relationship to REGIDESO. The legal recognition of
 the autonomous systems in the new Water Law was a big step toward safeguarding autonomous
 systems from asset expropriation and state predation. Even so, and though many autonomous
 schemes are currently serving areas in which REGIDESO has no effective presence, if both
 ASUREPs and REGIDESO “continue to extend their service areas, they will increasingly find
 themselves in competition” (Bédécarrats 2016, 12). This may put ASUREPs in a difficult
 position, especially as REGIDESO continues to price its water below cost.

 Competition is not inevitable, however, and a fully autonomous role of these small systems may
 only be transitional. These “two actors could find a common interest in collaborating [for
 instance,] the ASUREPs could purchase water wholesale from REGIDESO and distribute it in
 areas where they are more efficient” (Bédécarrats 2016, 12). As citywide networks expand,
 coordination will become critical. To date, however, a strategic plan or explicit agreements are
 lacking.

 In spite of these unresolved challenges, peri-urban autonomous schemes have been a pro-poor
 success story in urban water supply of the Democratic Republic of Congo. They provide a low
 cost solution to basic water supply when citywide infrastructure is not financially or technically
 feasible. This makes them particularly suitable for small towns or peri-urban areas that are not
 reached by existing networks. The key challenge will be to successfully extend this model
 beyond the present core areas, to make the support organizations less dependent on external
 financing, and to coordinate investments into autonomous schemes with larger-scale suppliers,
 in particular REGIDESO, to avoid duplication and conflict.

      Implications for Pro-Poor Services in Urban Water
      Inequalities of improved urban water access in the Democratic Republic of Congo are not
      primarily within, but between major and marginal urban areas. Most urban poor without
      access live on the margins of large centers and in smaller cities. The primary challenge for
      pro-poor water services is thus to correct the structural bias, which is a direct consequence
      of REGIDESO’s historic focus on major centers, and the traditional weakness of alternative
      urban supply models due to its past monopoly. The partial success of REGIDESO’s reform
      since 2008 has fallen short of financial sustainability and a decentralized service expansion
      to smaller cities. The rise of autonomous schemes has been encouraging, though still
      lacks scale.

      A systematic improvement of services for the poor is thus not simply a matter of evolutionary
      operational fixes, more structural changes are necessary. Operational improvements at
      REGIDESO, such as standpost construction, tariff adjustments (for example, to bring standpost
      tariffs below those of household connections and end the presently regressive cross-subsidies),
      gradual expansion of existing networks, and service quality improvements of course continue
      to matter in light of the new SDG targets and fast urban growth in core REGIDESO centers. Yet
      to reach the poor in marginal urban areas, a new push for decentralized, alternative investments
      is necessary. The achievement of the Water Law is that it creates a legal basis for decentralized
      supply, opening complementary financing channels through provincial counterparts and third-
      party operators. This allows more direct investments in marginal areas that REGIDESO is not
      reaching.


      Urban Sanitation: Where to Begin?
      Urban sanitation is the WASH subsector with the lowest improved access, the weakest
      institutional structure, and the least funding. Even optimistic estimates put the urban access
      to improved sanitation rate in the Democratic Republic of Congo at a mere 28.5 percent and
      show a decline since 2000 (table 5.4) (UNICEF and WHO 2015). In the absence of systematic
      interventions, the absolute number of urban dwellers lacking improved sanitation has risen
      dramatically from barely 6 million in 1975 to over 30 million today. This is expected to double
      again by 2035. Poorer households tend to have worse access, but access to safe facilities is
      low even for the top 60 percent. Access to safely managed sanitation targeted by the SDGs
      is below 4 percent, as very few households have improved private toilets with handwashing
      facilities and safe disposal of feces. This is nothing less than a public health crisis, reflected
      in high rates of diarrhea and malnutrition among urban children.

 Funding for urban sanitation has remained minimal. Total disbursed and committed financing
 has been less than USD 50 million for the period 2005–20, 20 times lower than in urban
 water. Many factors have conspired to lead to this outcome: the lack of sector policy leadership,
 the absence of institutions capable of planning and absorbing investments effectively at the
 local level, the hidden impact of poor sanitation which limits political pressure and facilitates
 collective inaction, the paralyzing scale of needs and the complexity of Democratic Republic of
 Congo’s urban areas that range from semi-rural towns to the megapolis Kinshasa. The dominant
 question in urban sanitation is thus: where to begin?

 The subsector has been trapped in an informal, low-outcome equilibrium unable to overcome the
 collective action problem of poor sanitation. It will require public efforts to initiate new solutions.
 While a comprehensive solution to the urban sanitation problem in the Democratic Republic of
 Congo is unlikely in the medium term, it is critical to lay a foundation for larger-scale action at
 the city level by resolving the prevailing institutional confusion and by breaking with decades of
 public inaction with well-defined, replicable pilots focused on priority areas. Such pilots should
 improve the sanitation service chain to achieve significant local impact. At this stage, on-site
 sanitation will remain dominant. Piped sewerage may be viable only for the densest central
 areas and would have to overcome high costs and limited OandM capacity even there.

 The most suitable public counterpart in the Democratic Republic of Congo to implement locally
 appropriate and demand-responsive sanitation solutions is the municipal level, which is currently
 largely inactive in urban sanitation. Existing policies and the new Water Law provide a basis for
 a decentralized approach and service delegation (Articles 90–96). A ministerial decree may
 further specify responsibilities and standards as foreseen in the law.

 At the start of a renewed effort in urban sanitation, the focus should be on the largest cities. It
 is there that negative externalities of poor sanitation are highest, where synergistic effects with
 existing improved water access can be realized, and where economies of scale may allow a
 role for commercial actors.

 This subsection aims to give a concise overview of the history and institutional constraints in
 urban sanitation, complemented by specific recommendations in the conclusion to break with
 decades of neglect.


 Historical Context: A Century of Inaction

 Urban sanitation has been a neglected problem since colonial times. In 1927, a report by the
 Belgian government cited hygiene and sanitation in urban areas among the biggest public
 health challenges in the colony behind only the fight against sleeping sickness (see also
 appendix Z), pointing out that:

    Hygiene in cities and stations has always been the most neglected problem in the colony.
    The reason can be found in a lack of qualified staff dedicated to planning and implementing
    [sanitation] infrastructure, the lack of coordination between responsible institutions and
    absence of hygiene awareness. (Royaume de Belgique 1928, 28, 30)

 While the colonial government eventually built some sewerage and drainage infrastructure, it
 remained limited to the centers of major cities and began to fall into disrepair after independence.
 In 1974, a World Bank report highlighted the decay, inaction, and regression in the urban
 sanitation sector:

    Sewers have not been properly maintained for the last decade and the few treatment
    plants in existence no longer function […] The institutional situation in sewerage […] is far
    from clear […] there are no institutions comparable with REGIDESO […] In the absence
    of adequate institutions there are no development plans for sewerage. (WHO and IBRD
    1974 iii, 3, 6)


WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                        69
      The national water utility REGIDESO never took a significant role in urban sanitation. Even
      though REGIDESO was judged to be a “strong candidate to take charge of sewerage in the long
      term” (WHO and IBRD 1974), this never occurred due to financial constraints and the utility’s
      pre-occupation with water. Instead, the same set of challenges persisted, as a WHO report
      noted a decade later in the early 1980s:

         In contrast to urban water supply, the other subsectors have practically not developed
         during the past decade […] immediate measures [are] particularly necessary in the urban
         sanitation subsector […] other than the lack of resources, the major constraint to the
         development of urban sanitation seems to be the near total absence of an institutional
         framework. (WHO 1982, 6)

      The establishment of the Sanitation Directorate (DAS) in the early 1980s, now within the
      MECNDD, created a national institution formally responsible for the hygienic disposal of excreta
      and wastewater. However, DAS has been underfunded since its inception and its actions largely
      limited to small-scale interventions with little lasting impact (WSP 2011b, 14). The Sanitation
      Directorate has also remained a marginal concern in a ministry primarily occupied with the
      country’s vast forestry resources and in administrative competition with other state institutions
      such as the MPH.

      In 2006, a World Bank-financed study once more noted the “badly organized and unsuitable
      institutional framework,” “weakness of financial flows,” and “lack of capacity” (IGIP 2006), and
      to date little progress has been made. The latest restatement of the unchanging challenges of
      urban sanitation has come in the sanitation policy DAS itself released in 2013:

         Lack of political prioritisation and lack of an adequate legal and institutional framework,
         alongside weaknesses in basic infrastructure and inadequate financing, make the sanitation
         sector one of the lowest performing in the [Democratic Republic of Congo]. (MECNDD
         2013, 6)

      For a century, while the population of Democratic Republic of Congo’s cities rose by the tens of
      millions, a circular problem prevented progress in urban sanitation: without a capable
      institutional framework, infrastructure could not be financed and maintained; but without
      financing, institutions could not arise and take meaningful action.

      Institutional Constraints in Urban Sanitation: Policy Confusion
      and the Implementation Gap
      The urban sanitation portfolio at national level is split between competing ministries leading to
      confusion in overall planning, regulation, and sector leadership, and lacks implementation
      capacity. From a policy perspective, the unification of planning and supervision tasks in one
      national public sanitation service is a priority. In terms of service delivery, municipalities have
      increasingly been identified as responsible for infrastructure construction, asset ownership,
      and service delegation, yet have not assumed these roles in practice in any major city of the
      Democratic Republic of Congo. The municipal role should be confirmed and meaningfully
      realized through city-based and -owned pilot interventions in priority urban areas.

      At policy level, the main institutional overlap is between the Directorate of Sanitation (DAS) in
      the Ministry of Environment (MECNDD) and the Directorate of Hygiene in the MPH. The two
      agencies have issued competing national policies aiming to place their institution at the center
      of sector leadership (table 5.5). While the practical focus of the MPH remains on rural sanitation,
      where it wields significant resources through the EVA program, its involvement confuses sector
      actors and prevents clear strategic leadership. Institutional overlap is replicated at provincial
      level with horizontal overlaps between provincial divisions of environment and public health,
      which are further complicated by lack of clarity about vertical lines of accountability as provincial
      divisions sometimes report to the provincial and sometimes to the national minister.

 There is more consensus on the principle that municipalities ought to be responsible for
 infrastructure implementation and service delegation, though it remains largely theoretical.
 Under both the MECNDD’s PONA and MPH’s PNHAB, the municipal level has primary
 responsibility for urban infrastructure construction and service delegation. The new Water Law
 also supports, though does not prescribe, municipal institutions as implementing agencies,
 and mandates the separation of asset ownership and service provision. Unfortunately, there
 appear to be no municipal authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo that have actually
 implemented sanitation infrastructure or supported service provision at significant scale yet.

 The creation of capable municipal institutions is of particular importance in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, because urban sanitation has historically not fallen into the remit of the
 urban water utility REGIDESO. Considering its new commercial mandate and focus on achieving
 cost recovery, REGIDESO is not positioned to build up sanitation services that would likely
 require subsidies for a considerable time. Moreover, REGIDESO’s centralized administrative
 structure would be ill-suited to deliver sanitation services outside a few cities.

 In terms of the institutional framework, there are thus clear opportunities for improvement.
 Harmonizing the two competing policies and consolidating institutional leadership in one
 national public sanitation service could reduce inertia and conflict at national and provincial
 levels. In terms of service delivery, the new law and policies support a key role for municipal
 agencies, but these need to be built up as well as given budget and responsibility to realize
 concrete interventions.


 Addressing the Entire Urban Sanitation Service Chain
 The new SDGs shift focus from a single-minded concern about containment of fecal matter in
 toilet facilities, to a more comprehensive approach that aims for a safe sanitation service chain
 from initial containment to safe disposal. The sanitation service chain (figure 5.4) starts with
 the initial separation and containment of fecal matter from human contact. Under the 2015
 MDGs, hygienic separation was the ultimate target and defining characteristic of improved
 toilets. As detailed in chapter 2, barely a quarter of the urban population have improved facilities
 table 5.4, and less than 17 percent of the B40 by asset wealth. This appears driven by the high
 cost of improved latrines, which have been estimated at USD 300–400 for a simple pour-flush

      pit latrine for a household in urban Democratic Republic of Congo and as high as USD 1,400
      for a septic tank (Hutton and Varughese 2016).

      Even the first step of hygienic separation of feces from human contact is thus a financial stretch
      for most Congolese. However, the more stringent SDGs also require its safe management after
      this initial separation. Unless possible on-site, this requires safe emptying, transport, treatment,
      and disposal of fecal matter.

      In dense urban areas, there is no space for consistent and universal on-site containment, and
      the organization of a safe off-site service chain has so far failed due to inaction of the public
      sector. In urban Democratic Republic of Congo, piped sewer systems for off-site treatment are
      virtually unknown. Over 95 percent of the urban population use facilities that first contain fecal
      matter on-site in a pit (82 percent) or septic tank (13 percent). Safe management of these
      sites would require a secure covering of filled pits or their safe emptying and disposal, which
      is relatively uncommon. Poor urban households generally construct latrines themselves or use
      informal masons, leading to low-quality pits. In combination with lack of space and often low
      groundwater, this creates poor conditions for safe on-site containment in urban Democratic
      Republic of Congo. Latrine contents often discharge into their surroundings, in the absence of
      any attempt to empty and safely dispose fecal matter (OPM 2016).

      Demand for professional emptying services is low due to high cost and results in uncontrolled
      discharge. In Kinshasa, the cost of mechanical emptying with trucks is approximately USD 100,
      while manual emptying costs are approximately USD 50. In a survey carried out by the WPD in
      Kinshasa, a third of households with septic tanks and nearly two-thirds with unimproved pits
      have not emptied these in the past five years. When emptying was done, over 65 percent of
      households did so manually.

      Even when emptying takes place, it does not solve, but merely displaces, the public health
      problem, as there are no formal sites for the safe disposal of fecal sludge. A review of six of the
      largest cities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi,
      Kananga, Bukavu, and Kindu) revealed no functional treatment plants nor even formal, safe
      disposal sites. Instead, the excrement of millions is dumped without supervision into the open
      ground or water bodies in and around cities (OPM 2016). Past urban sanitation interventions
      were minor subcomponents in water-focused projects and were generally limited to dispersed
      public latrine systems with no clear link to municipal agencies or disposal options. This did not
      address systematic weaknesses in the sanitation service chain and had no lasting impact.

      The weak sanitation service chain is marked by a set of interlocking constraints that contribute
      to a collective action problem. While the public as a whole would greatly benefit from a safe
      service chain, the costs are too high to be borne individually at every step, and potential benefits
      are undermined by gaps further down the chain. The problem of safe disposal illustrates this:
      without controlled, safe, and accessible disposal sites, uncontrolled dumping of fecal matter will
      continue unabated in Congolese cities. Yet designation of such sites requires public action and
      cannot be undertaken at individual level, and indeed, has even been opposed locally. Emptying
      and transport services remain sporadic and geared toward wealthier households. Without safe
      disposal sites, this merely shifts the public health problem rather than solving it. Similarly, even
      when households invest in hygienic toilet facilities and emptying, these benefits are undermined
      if others continue to dump fecal matter into the shared environment.

 The lack of effective collective action is a direct result of the absence of capable institutions and
 financing, facilitated by low attributability and diminished expectations. Amid a host of other
 problems, public demand for sanitation improvements is low as the negative externalities are
 not as visible as, for instance, those of solid waste. Nor are there recent examples of successful
 public interventions to set expectations.


 Implications for Pro-Poor Services in Urban Sanitation
 The poorest suffer most from collective action problems across the sanitation service chain as
 they lack the means to privately compensate for the lack of public interventions. In urban
 sanitation, the cost of a septic tank is approximately three times the current per capita GDP of
 the Democratic Republic of Congo (Hutton and Varughese 2016). Even if poor households
 invest in expensive on-site solutions, they remain at higher risk off cross-contamination in their
 poorer, denser, and less controlled neighborhoods. Other vulnerabilities associated with
 poverty, such as food scarcity and lack of medical care compound the risks of exposure to
 unsafe WASH facilities.

 Municipal institutions able to take significant collective action must emerge if urban sanitation
 services for the poor are to be improved. Given the lack of space for safe confinement, private
 on-site facilities are not a feasible approach, even if high-quality latrines were widely affordable.
 Traditional, citywide sewer systems are also not realistic in the medium term. At best incipient
 municipal sanitation agencies cannot absorb investments of such complexity, and would lack
 the capacity for operations and maintenance.

 A gradual approach focused on discrete, practical, pro-poor interventions along the entire service
 chain is thus advisable. Options include the construction of safe disposal sites, the
 professionalization of emptying services, support to developing lower-cost latrines, construction
 of local decentralized condominium sewer systems and point-of-use water treatment to fight
 fecal contamination directly. Such incremental steps are more realistic, yet could have
 quantifiable local impact and start a cycle of institutional and service improvement. Box 5.1
 details the case of Kinshasa, which illustrates many of these issues.




       Box 5.1: Urban Sanitation in Kinshasa: A Case Study

       Map B 5.1.1 provides an overview of the known distribution of sanitation technologies
       in Kinshasa.

       Access: The colonial sewer system in central Kinshasa has been dysfunctional for
       decades. Today the majority of the capital’s population relies on shared, low-quality
       latrines. While outright open defecation is low (2 percent), only 21 percent of Kinois
       have access to unshared improved toilets. Of these, less than 7 percent also have
       handwashing facilities as targeted by the new SDGs. Worryingly, even fecal matter
       from improved facilities is generally not disposed of safely due to the weak sanitation
       service chain.

       Containment: Even improved latrines are typically of low quality with fecal matter
       seeping into the ground or water bodies (CNAEA et al. 2015). In the WPD survey of
       seven communes in Kinshasa, over 38 percent of households had never emptied
       their pit, letting it overflow or moving location when it was full.

                                                                          box continues next page




WASH Poor in a Water-Rich Country 	                                                                      73
      Box 5.1: Continued

      Emptying and transport: The dangers of unsafe containment are heightened by the
      limited availability of professional emptying services. There are no public trucks in
      service. Private mechanical emptying services are small scale and expensive
      (approximately 10 companies with 2–5 trucks each). Emptying costs are relatively
      high with even individual manual emptiers charging between USD 50–100.

      Treatment and Disposal: Kinshasa does not have any safe disposal or treatment sites.
      Trucks dump sludge at the confluence of the Yolo and Kalumu rivers, or use a site near
      Ndola Airport (Limete commune). The volume of sludge reaching waterways has been
      estimated to be approximately 400 cubic meters per day (IGIP 2006; OPM 2016).

      Institutions: Unlike other cities, Kinshasa does have a dedicated Sanitation and
      Public Works Agency (Régie d’assainissement et des travaux publics de Kinshasa,
      RATPK), which was created in 2008. Its role is to provide technical support
      and coordination for public cleanliness, vector control, solid waste management, and
      fecal sludge emptying services. RATPK has approximately 200 employees, and
      sanitation is one of five directorates. However, its focus in “sanitation” is almost
      exclusively on solid waste, which is more politically salient. While the overall
      sanitation budget was reportedly USD 15 million in 2016, disbursement was below
      20 percent and no funds were allocated for fecal sludge management. A decree has
      been signed to set up a sanitation fund (Fonds d’assainissement pour la ville de
      Kinshasa, FONAK) with the aim of channeling all investments into one budget under
      the authority of provincial ministers of environment and finance. FONAK is not yet
      operational but, like RATPK, constitutes a potential future implementation vehicle.a

       Mikonga has taken the initiative to build public latrines for approximately 100 daily
       users. The French Development Agency (AFD)-funded Projet de Promotion de
       modalités Innovantes pour L’Accès à l’Eau Potable, à l’assainissement et à l’hygiène
       (PILAEP) project has supported latrine construction in selected health centers.
       A  settlement pond project to be financed by the World Bank’s IDA Urban Water
       Supply Project (PEMU) project did not come to pass due to local resistance and lack
       of clarity about institutional ownership. None of these projects have reached scale
       or attempted to address the entire sanitation service chain systematically.

       Existing plans and possible next steps: Kinshasa would be well suited for new urban
       sanitation pilots, because an incipient municipal institutional structure already
       exists, logistics are comparatively easy, and a number of analyses and strategic
       plans for sanitation interventions are available.

       In 2007, the World Bank financed an extensive sanitation study and action plan for
       Kinshasa which was never followed up (IGIP 2006). In 2013, RATPK with support
       from AFD developed a strategic plan for Kinshasa (Schéma d’Orientation Stratégique
       de l’Agglomération Kinoise, SOSAK) which provides an inventory of urban services,
       including sanitation. This was complemented by a 2015 review of WASH infrastructure
       by CNAEA, the city of Kinshasa, and WaterAid. These documents provide a wealth of
       information that new pilot projects can build on.

       Particularly promising pilot approaches include the following: reviving earlier plans
       for a safe fecal sludge treatment site with clarified institutional responsibility by
       RATPK/FONAK; piloting decentralized wastewater treatment plants in peri-urban
       areas in collaboration with ASUREPs; improving existing waterways in the city to
       drain rain and wastewater more effectively; carrying out a study on the private market
       for latrine construction aimed at improving latrine quality and lowering cost.

 Rural Water and Sanitation: Struggling to Scale
 The rural water and sanitation subsectors are characterized by a low rate of improved access,
 but a moderately positive trend over the past 10–15 years (table 5.6). Despite these positive
 trends, the 2015 Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets were missed. Moreover, even as
 access rates improved, the rural population grew so fast that the total number of rural dwellers
 without access to water and sanitation had increased by almost 10 million since 1990. In the
 case of rural sanitation, open defecation remains relatively moderate in comparison to
 neighboring countries, but has unfortunately increased slightly (UN 2014; UNICEF and WHO
 2015). The top 60 percent (T60) of rural households by expenditure level have significantly
 better access to improved rural water and sanitation than the bottom 40 percent (B40),
 though the difference is significantly more compressed in the sanitation sector due to overall
 lower access across all income and wealth levels.

      The situation appears more dire still when reviewing access in terms of the SDGs. The SDGs
      set more ambitious service quality goals than just improved access. The SDG safely managed
      water and sanitation access is virtually nonexistent in rural areas at below 0.5  percent,
      respectively. While about two-thirds of rural households with improved water access have their
      source within 30 minutes, only 1 percent have one on premises, and only a fraction of these
      has continuous and uncontaminated supply from this source (i.e. safely managed). In rural
      sanitation, less than 1 percent of households have improved toilet and handwashing facilities.

      Funding commitments and disbursements for the period 2005–20 have remained modest
      overall at just over USD 430 million, less than half of funding for urban water. Over 90 percent
      of these funds have been implemented through or in association with the EVA program, the
      main arms of which are directed by UNICEF in cooperation with the MPH and Ministry of
      Education. The program has extended improved water and sanitation services to millions of
      Congolese since its inception in 2008.

      The EVA program has faced three major challenges: it has struggled to sustain results, not yet
      overcome capacity constraints to scale up, and remained too reliant on foreign funding. A core task
      in rural water and sanitation will be to overcome these issues and scale up the impact of EVA. At
      the end of the ongoing, second phase of EVA (2013–17) many of these challenges are beginning
      to be addressed through the development of a post-certification processes and better prioritization
      of intervention areas to improve sustainability, training programs to work toward closing the capacity
      gap, and the adoption of new technologies to reduce costs. The extension of EVA beyond its current
      implementation cycle that ends in 2017 will be critical to allow these efforts to come to fruition.

      The following sections aim to give a concise overview of the history and present
      institutional constraints in rural water and sanitation, leading to the chapter’s conclusion
      with recommendations for next steps.

 Historical Context: The Evolution of an Externally Driven
 Rural WASH Sector
 In the dispersed rural settlements of the Congo, traditional approaches to water supply and
 sanitation persisted for a long time undisturbed by interventions from ever-remote government
 authorities. A 1927 report by the colonial government noted sporadic latrine building in villages
 in “certain places,” but generally found unsatisfactory hygiene practices and an absence of
 safe, potable water even in the colony’s cities. The report also noted that provincial cases of
 amoebic dysentery could “evidentially” be attributed “to the conditions of hygiene, and notably
 the question of water, which remains without solution” (Royaume de Belgique 1928, 16, 28).

 While the colonial government started to invest in the expansion of urban drinking water
 supplies from the 1930s on, little changed in most rural areas. In the final decade of the
 colonial era a report highlighted that:

    [T]he vast majority of the population continues to use their ancestral water points,
    sometimes in the neighborhood of the village, sometimes several kilometers away. These
    difficult to access waterpoints are [typically] situated at the edge of a river or a pond.
    (Borgniez 1952, 5)

 The negative health consequences had also persisted, as was well understood at the time:

    [T]he conditions of water sources are such that they expose users to […] infections,
    either by drinking polluted water or by wading into water in which disease vectors develop.
    Medical statistics give evidence of the importance of mortality and morbidity attributable
    to typhus, dysentery, hookworm, schistosomiasis [and] the spread of malaria. (Borgniez
    1952, 6)

 Systematic public interventions in the rural sector only started after World War II, in particular
 with the creation of the “Indigenous Welfare Fund” (Fonds du Bien-être Indigène, FBEI) in 1947.
 While neither the FBEI nor other actors intervened at scale in rural sanitation, rural water
 supply became a focus of the fund. The FBEI prioritized intervention areas by population
 density, high prevalence of water-borne disease and stably settled populations (de Raeve
 1997, 330).

 In the last decade of the colonial regime, the FBEI supported the construction of approx. 3,000
 protected springs, standposts and wells in selected areas. These interventions supplied at least
 770,000 rural Congolese with improved water, that is, about 6 percent of the rural population
 at the time (de Raeve 1997, 333; WHO and IBRD 1974, 3) Nevertheless, considering the vast
 rural population that remained unserved, the FBEI’s achievements in rural water were still
 judged “far from adequate” after it discontinued its activities in 1964 (WHO and IBRD 1974,
 3). Yet, with its demise, interventions declined even further.

 In the mid−1970s, a study noted that there were “no adequate plans […] for the extension of
 rural water supplies” and “many of the existing systems, simple as they are, have fallen into
 disrepair”. It was pointed out that “before [needed] large-scale development programmes” for
 “rural water supply, sewerage and drainage […] can be undertaken” capable institutions would
 first have to be created (WHO and IBRD 1974, iii).

 Yet such institutions remained elusive. Though formal responsibility rested with the state’s
 Rural Development Office in the Agricultural Department (Bureau du Développement Rural), the
 government gave “low priority […] to rural development” and the “little that has been done in
 this sector since independence has been undertaken mostly by [AIDR], a non-profit Brussels
 based organization, and by UNICEF” (WHO and IBRD 1974, 3-4). In 1977, UNICEF supported
 the creation of a Rural Water Project, which, in 1983, developed into the National Rural Water
 Service (SNHR) in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Although SNHR

      eventually developed a nationwide presence with hundreds of staff, it remained primarily
      externally funded and “in reality most rural water development in Zaire is carried about
      by  [private voluntary organizations] or religious missions” (Warner and Leger 1984). In the
      early 2000s, SNHR’s budget (excluding salaries) was a mere USD 61,000 (UNEP 2011, 36).

      The Department of Public Health (now MPH) also started to intervene in rural water supply,
      but did so only sporadically and at a limited scale (e.g., some 300 protected springs and
      5 wells in 1981–84). A study by WHO at the time also noted that beyond geographically
      limited interventions, primarily by NGOs and UNICEF, potable water is “practically
      inexistent” in rural areas, the availability of latrines “very insufficient” and access
      “probably not exceeding 10  percent” of the population (WHO 1982, 6-7, 9). For larger
      rural settlements, WHO recommended a concerted water and sanitation infrastructure
      construction effort of the Rural Development and Public Health offices in cooperation
      with NGOs, while for smaller, dispersed rural settlements it thought “water or sanitation
      coverage by public means impossible to envisage” and instead recommended “education
      campaigns” (WHO 1982, 8)

      Historically, the institutional framework of the rural water and sanitation sector has thus
      developed slowly and remained highly reliant on external and non-state actors: first the FBEI,
      and later AIDR, UNICEF, and a host of associated national and international NGOs. The role
      of external agencies has only increased as the chaos of the 1990s and early 2000s further
      eroded the capacity of state institutions. External support and non-state agencies will
      continue to play a critical positive role in the sector, but will not be able to substitute for
      functional local government at scale. This is illustrated by the EVA program, which has
      become the most important intervention in rural WASH in the Democratic Republic of Congo
      since its launch in 2008.

      Institutional Constraints in Rural WASH: EVA and the Limits of
      the Externally Driven Approach
      The EVA program is today by far the largest rural WASH program in the Democratic Republic
      of Congo, absorbing over 90 percent of funding in rural WASH (figure 5.2). Due to its unique
      scope and importance, EVA’s institutional structure and challenges are reflective of those of
      the rural WASH sector as a whole. A first phase of EVA was implemented in 2008–12, investing
      nearly USD 100 million, and a second phase for the period 2013–17 is ongoing with a budget
      in excess of USD 150 million.6 Virtually the entire program is externally funded, primarily by
      DfID. Formal responsibility for EVA rests with the MPH and Ministry of Education (MoE), with
      supervisory and coordination roles extending to the deconcentrated provincial offices of these
      ministries. In practice, however, UNICEF manages EVA at national level and execution in the
      field is overwhelmingly done by sub-contracted NGOs and private partners. Under the UNICEF
      umbrella, over 150 local and international partners have been implementing the project
      (UNICEF 2016)

      The aim of the EVA program is the achievement of WASH-related “norms” upon which the
      respective village or school is declared “healthy.” These targeted norms are key water, sanitation,
      and hygiene indicators, and are listed in table 5.7 for villages and schools, respectively.

      In late 2016, the EVA program reported having certified 6,504 villages and 1,720 schools as
      “healthy” since the start of the program in 2008. The program had extended potable water
      access to over five million rural dwellers, improved sanitation facilities to over 4.5 million, and
      handwashing with soap to over 4.2 million. This represents approximately 10 percent of the
      rural population in 2016.7 Over 600,000 pupils gained access to safe water, sanitation and
      handwashing (MPH 2016). The program also reported significantly reduced diarrheal disease-
      related morbidity and mortality in certified villages (UNICEF 2016). Map 5.3 highlights all
      health zones in the country in which the EVA program was active, though generally not covering
      the entire population in each.

 Despite these achievements, the EVA program has faced three key challenges: sustaining
 achieved results; overcoming capacity constraints to scale interventions; and a dependence
 on external funding and expertise for implementation.

 The sustainability of the results of EVA has been low. In a sample of 1,832 certified villages, only
 7 percent maintained all seven norms at the first post-certification visit. While nearly 30 percent
 of villages failed to maintain sufficient improved water access and handwashing, almost
 80 percent did not sustain the improved sanitation norm (MPH 2016). Data from a sub-sample
 of schools in four provinces showed wide variation, with between 15 percent and 75 percent of
 schools maintaining all four school norms and thus their “healthy” status. Repeated post-
 certification visits assisted many target locations in re-gaining their “healthy” status.
 Nevertheless, the sustainability results highlight the risk of rapid erosion of initial gains of EVA
 in WASH access, underlining the importance of quality control among the many implementing
 agencies and repeated reinforcement of initial achievements through post-certification revisits.
 Such revisits have major budget implications, forcing a trade-off between consolidation of
 results and further expansion, and thus constitute a significant constraint on  EVA scale-up.
 Moreover, it remains unclear at what point results can be sustained without further revisits.

 An expansion of the EVA program is critical if SDG targets are to be met, yet the present
 institutional structure is struggling to scale. Although the number of beneficiaries of the EVA
 program over the period 2008–16 is unprecedented in the rural WASH sector of the Democratic
 Republic of Congo, the rural population grew faster still during the same period, even before

      taking imperfect sustainability into account. Scaling further to achieve the SDGs would require
      not just more finance, but the capacity to absorb it. With over 150 partners already engaged,
      UNICEF, MPH, and MoE are struggling to maintain the desired quality and pace of implementation
      (UNICEF 2016). Moreover, a more specific systematic capacity gap of EVA is its focus on point-
      sources and its limited expertise in constructing small piped networks in larger rural settlements
      with a conducive environment (for example, allowing a gravity-fed scheme), which have helped
      millions of Congolese gain access to convenient piped water in the past.

      EVA funding requirements—over USD 30 million per year in Phase 2—are substantial and the
      almost complete reliance on external financing is a key risk to the program. Funding risks
      are particularly high given close to 75 percent of Phase 2 funding is from a single source (the
      Department for International Development [DfID]) and a freezing or non-renewal of funding
      would be difficult to replace. Repeated revisits to sites to sustain results, and increased
      capacity building to create the foundation for larger-scale efforts are critical if progress toward
      the SDGs is to be realistic. In rural areas, there are few WASH programs which are not partly
      supported or at least associated with EVA, and none of comparable scale.

 Key Challenges for Pro-Poor Service in Rural Water
 and Sanitation
 The EVA approach is well suited to achieving pro-poor outcomes within the villages and schools
 it targets, however, reaching smaller and more remote poor communities remains a challenge.
 The EVA program is fundamentally community driven in the tradition of the community-led total
 sanitation approach (CLTS). Thus, EVA promotes the inclusion of the most vulnerable, such as
 female-headed households, elderly, disabled, and the poorest within villages in which the
 program is implemented. However, given the sheer scale of rural WASH needs and the wide
 distribution of rural villages, limited project budgets must prioritize locations that are easier to
 reach, offer at least some economies of scale (that is, sufficient population), and have a basic
 ability to economically sustain interventions. There is thus a clear tension between equity and
 efficiency in rural WASH.

 While to some extent unavoidable in a context of limited resources, it will remain important that
 prioritization of interventions is not seen as a binary choice, and that opportunities to
 differentiate interventions are explored. Thus, while a full-scale EVA intervention with drilled
 wells and sophisticated toilet facilities may not be suitable for a particularly remote, small,
 and poor village, a more limited menu of small-scale actions could perhaps still be considered
 (such as solar disinfection of water, manual drilling, and so on).

 This equity–efficiency dilemma applies only where the program has a presence at all. As
 outlined, the vast majority of the rural population and rural poor are not reached at all due to
 capacity, financing, and sustainability constraints. When needs are so universal, targeting and
 differentiation of interventions is a second-order problem compared to the need to build a
 permanent program capable of operating at the required national scale. Ultimately, the pro-
 poor reach of the EVA program will depend on whether the current externally driven and financed
 program can be transformed into a scaled-up, effective permanent program anchored in
 national institutions and able to deploy the full range of WASH technologies, including small
 gravity-fed water networks, as appropriate.



 Conclusion
 The WASH sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo faces a variety of persistent, structural
 challenges. The overarching issues are the sector’s institutional fragmentation, capacity gaps
 (especially at decentralized level), related systematic biases in funding, and poor governance,
 which collectively undermine the ability of the sector to cope with rapid demographic and
 socioeconomic change.

 The overarching institutional challenges manifest in varied ways at subsector level. In urban
 water supply, the erosion of access and increasing gaps between major and minor cities
 are directly related to the concentration of funds on a REGIDESO that is struggling to
 reform itself and reach beyond its traditional core service centers. The weakness and
 underfunding of alternative supply models and rural institutions has further aggravated
 REGIDESO’s limitations. The institutional fragmentation at national level and absent
 regulatory capacity has prevented a systematic understanding of the scale of water quality
 problems, much less enforcement. Urban sanitation services are nonexistent due to the
 lack of policy leadership disengaged municipalities and non-involvement of the national
 water utility, which limit the implementation capacity of the subsector. While the EVA
 Program has attracted significant funds to rural areas, it has struggled to sustain and
 scale up results due to weak capacity of rural state institutions support its NGO-driven
 service-delivery model. Figure 5.5 provides a brief overview of the most central constraints
 and resulting service gaps outlined in this chapter.

      The new Water Law and Policy are no panacea for the varied sector challenges, but provide
      momentum and a legal basis to start addressing many core issues. The impact of the new
      Water Law and associated policy on the institutional structure and associated service gaps
      is potentially profound: A dedicated water ministry, regulator and potential re-ordering of the
      sanitation sector could decisively reduce fragmentation and provide stronger leadership on
      issues such as water quality. The recognition of the principle of at-cost tariffs could improve
      cost recovery while investments in marginal urban areas could be boosted by the shift to
      provincial government responsibility for infrastructure and support for delegated management
      and autonomous systems. Decentralization of responsibility could also strengthen local
      government’s role in donor-financed rural WASH programs. A key challenge going forward
      will be realizing the law’s potential in face of an entrenched sector structure and complex
      political reality.

      Two complementary approaches to implementing the law may be discerned. The first approach
      emphasizes the gradual creation of the administrative, regulatory, and legal structures to apply
      the law in practice. The second approach posits that the law already provides a basis for key
      principles such as decentralized asset ownership, service delegation and at-cost tariffs to be
      realized, and calls for projects to create practical precedents. A sole focus on formal process
      risks losing momentum and entrenching the status quo.

      Government and donors should balance the two approaches. As outlined in the key
      recommendations at the top of this diagnostic, strong support to create institutional ownership
      for the law and the development of required decrees will be critical, but can be combined with
      an operational focus on particularly pressing service needs. Thus, a proto-regulator and
      ministry could help prioritize regulation and pilot projects around core service gaps, such as
      water quality and malnutrition, or the service biases toward large cities. This could imply, for
      instance, combining decrees setting water quality norms and consequences for non-compliance
      with investments to test water more systematically, or support to develop delegated
      management contracts in urban water with province-level investments beyond only REGIDESO.

      A mapping of gaps and challenges thus provides a starting point to unpack the complexity of
      WASH in Democratic Republic of Congo and to prioritize interventions that can respond to
      current and future needs. Chapters 2 and 3 of this diagnostic highlighted the scope of the

 challenge: limited progress in improving WASH access and weak quality of service, in the face
 of rapidly growing demand due to demographic growth and rapid urbanization compounded by
 the country’s size and protracted fragility. Chapter 4 emphasized the cross-sectoral linkages of
 WASH with health and nutrition. In a context of high poverty and malnutrition, addressing the
 lack of safe WASH can play a key role in protecting the foundations of the Democratic Republic
 of Congo’s potential for development. While emergency interventions such as point-of-use
 treatment may provide short-term relief, long-term improvements will depend on fixing the
 institutional weaknesses that underlie the profound gaps in WASH services in the Democratic
 Republic of Congo.

     REGIDESO’s statutes were amended with the ordinance no78−197, and in the context
     of a new public enterprise law (no78−002), which formalized its position as the sole
     urban water supplier. The legal monopoly was further strengthened in 1986 by a
     Ministerial Decree (no0014/DPT-MINER/86) prohibiting the use of natural water, other

 Appendix C
 Democratic Republic of Congo
 WPD Household Survey Design
 and Methodology
 The Democratic Republic of Congo WPD carried out household surveys in seven communes of
 Kinshasa, the city of Kindu (the capital of the province of Maniema), the small town of Tchonka
 (South Kivu), the small town of Basankusu (Equateur) and the two rural hamlets of Bomate and
 Liyata in Equateur province. In each location, water quality tests (E. coli, nitrates, nitrites, free
 and total chlorine) were carried out for a subset of households. Table C.1 gives an overview of
 the survey size and number of water quality tests in each location.

 In contrast to existing surveys (DHS, Enquête 123, MICS), which are only representative at the
 province level, the WPD surveys provide an unprecedented city- (and in the case of Kinshasa,
 intra-city) and village-level view on the full set of water and sanitation variables, including
 estimates of poverty status using the SWIFT methodology (see below) and water quality testing,
 which is not typically part of household surveys.

      A core problem for surveys in developing countries, particularly in fragile states, is the lack
      of a sampling frame. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the last census was conducted
      in 1984 and no detailed administrative data is available. This makes it difficult to select an
      efficient and unbiased sample, which ideally requires a complete sampling frame of the
      population of interest (e.g., a recent census) from which a random sample can then be
      selected.

      Most national household surveys (LSMS, DHS, MICS, etc.) deal with this problem by using a
      two-stage cluster-sampling approach. An (approximate) administrative census is used to draw
      a first-stage sample of clusters/enumeration areas/primary sampling units, and then do a field
      listing of all households within the selected PSU. Finally, a second-stage random sample of
      households within each enumerated PSU is drawn.

      This two-stage cluster-sampling method has three disadvantages: (i) the administrative census
      that is the basis for the first-stage selection of PSUs (e.g., by probability proportional to size;
      PPS) can be quite unreliable; (ii) the process of listing households within selected PSUs before
      the second-stage draw is expensive; (iii) the two-stage sampling is inefficient due to the intra-
      cluster correlation, which is particularly elevated in the case of infrastructure—in other words,
      for the same estimate precision (margin of error), the sample size has to be larger to
      compensate for the loss of information because observations within PSUs are more similar to
      each other than if chosen randomly across the entire area of interest.


      Sampling Strategies in the WPD Survey
      The surveyed households were selected randomly in all sites, except in the small hamlets of
      Bomate and Liyata, in which all households were surveyed in what thus amounts to a village
      census.

      In the sites in which households were selected randomly, different methods of random selection
      were employed depending on the availability of sampling frames from which to draw the
      households. This flexible approach ensured properly randomized unbiased samples while
      minimizing costs. The following random selection methods were used:

        •	 One-stage random sampling based on local census

      This method was used in the communes of Kinshasa and Kasa-Vubu, for which a recent local
      census of households was available. This method does not require additional listings in the
      field, is unbiased and efficient, minimizing the margin of error in estimates, ceteris paribus. The
      household census from which the sample was randomly drawn was carried out after 2013 by
      Manobi for the national utility REGIDESO as part of a World Bank investment project covering
      all households in selected communes. A verification exercise for the census data was carried
      out in a subsection of the communes. The sample was then drawn randomly from the full
      census using a random-number generator.

        •	 One-stage random sampling based on satellite counts of dwellings

      This innovative method was used in the communes of Kisenso, Kimbanseke, and Mont Ngafula,
      as well as in the sites of Kindu, Tchonka, and Basankusu, for which no census was available.
      In a first step, the project used recent (2012–15) satellite images of the survey sites to count
      and geolocate all dwelling units, excluding units likely to be businesses (map C.1, see below
      for details). Each geolocated dwelling was then assigned a random number, and a sample was
      selected through a one-stage random draw.

 The counting and geolocation of dwelling units to compile the sampling frame was done
 manually and took into account a detailed understanding of typical dwelling units in the
 Democratic Republic of Congo in order to account for multiple-household buildings and to
 identify units likely to be businesses.

 A standard “dwelling unit” of one household was defined taking into account that these can
 differ not just between cities, but also within cities, varying from dense inner-districts to peri-
 urban and even semi-rural areas at the outskirts. Consultants counting dwelling units took into
 account architecture (main dwelling versus backroom etc.), building size and features (dwelling
 threshold), roof segmentation, roof design intricacy, and height, building orientation (i.e. parallel
 to road has higher likelihood of being commercial non-dwelling units), site boundary features
 (lack of a fence-boundary wall, especially in peri-urban areas makes it less likely to be a
 dwelling unit), closeness to major streets, street activity and traffic (buildings very close to
 large busy streets are more likely to be commercial). Examples of standard dwelling units are
 given in Figure C.1.

    •	 Two-stage random sampling (Kinshasa communes Kinshasa and Kasa-Vubu)

 This method was used for the Kinshasa communes of N’djili and Makala for which neither a
 pre-existing census nor a satellite count and individual geolocation of dwellings was available
 at the time of surveying. The method is a variation on the two-stage cluster-sampling approach
 described above, i.e. a first-stage definition and draw of clusters, then a field enumeration of
 selected clusters, followed by a second-stage draw of enumerated houses within clusters. As
 noted above, this approach is unbiased, but not as efficient as the one-stage draw methods
 used in the other sites.

      With an out-of-census survey and outdated administrative census, the first stage of the sampling
      strategy was the definition of the primary sampling unit (PSU) for Kinshasa using satellite
      images. Those primary sampling units, renamed remote sensing unit (RSU) to avoid confusion
      with the PSU defined by the National Statistical Office (INS), were defined using four criteria:

        •	 Ranked by size

        •	 Logical and respecting administrative boundaries

        •	 Identifiable by enumerators/surveyors on the ground

        •	 Have descriptive physical characteristics (area, elevation, distance to central business
           district, land use, etc.).

      Multiple sources of data were used: administrative unit boundaries, openstreetmap street
      data, land-use polygons, and satellite imagery. Finally, to allow weighing the first-stage selection
      by population an automated algorithm on satellite imagery was used to estimate the number
      of housing units in each RSU (Figure C.2).

      In the communes, a cluster-sampling approach is used based on the RSUs for those communes:
      selecting 33 percent of said RSUs in a first-stage PPS random selection of the sampling units.
      A listing of all the households in the selected RSUs was then carried out in the field using GPS-
      enabled mobile devices. Finally, a second-stage sample of households was selected, and
      subsequently surveyed.


      Field Implementation
      The survey was implemented by a consultancy firm deploying experienced local survey staff
      moving in teams of two to ensure quality control and security of surveyors. Staff underwent

 detailed training of four days. A first pilot phase in February 2016 included two training
 sessions, and field-pilots to test the questionnaire, water quality tests, anthropometric
 measurement equipment, team, and leadership quality. During the survey implementation,
 surveyor teams were issued with detailed route-plans for the day by the survey leaders who
 supervised through monitoring incoming data and in the field.

 Households that were not present were revisited, and if not available upon revisit (e.g., due to
 the building being abandoned), the household was replaced with another randomly selected
 household.


 The Questionnaire
 The questionnaire was based on standard validated survey questions from surveys such as
 the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which were complemented by specialized questions
 querying further details, SWIFT questions to estimate poverty (see below), as well as
 anthropometric measurements of children under five and water-quality testing. Questionnaire
 length varied slightly by site but was approximately 75 questions long with key sections on
 household characteristics (e.g., number, sex, age of members), health (e.g., incidence of
 diarrhea among children, breastfeeding, disabilities, anthropometric measurements of under
 five year olds), water, sanitation, and hygiene, and issues of general well-being and nutrition.

      The questionnaire was field tested from February to April 2016 to identify and adjust for any
      difficulties in understanding questions.


      The SWIFT Methodology
      The SWIFT methodology was integrated into the questionnaires to allow a rapid evaluation of
      approximate household poverty status. The SWIFT method uses the latest household
      questionnaire that contains expenditure data (in the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
      we used Enquête 123 2012) to create a model that identifies a small set of core questions
      that will allow estimation of the expenditure level (i.e. poverty status) of the household. The
      selected questions are chosen to have the highest predictive value for the household’s
      expenditure level, and the answers to these questions are used to estimate household poverty
      status after the survey. SWIFT is thus a powerful survey instrument that can produce estimates
      of poverty and shared prosperity in a very timely and cost-effective manner.


      Water-Quality Testing
      In each site, a subset of households selected for surveying was randomly selected for water-
      quality testing. Water was tested at point of use, that is, households were asked to pour a
      glass of water as if they would drink it themselves, which was then tested for E. coli contamination,
      nitrates, nitrites, and free and total chlorine using field-testing equipment.

      For nitrate and nitrite testing, Hach test strips were used (Product #: 2745425).1 For
      testing free and total chlorine, Hach Color Disc Test Kits (Model CN-66) were used.2 For
      testing for E. coli contamination, a new, cheap and easy-to-use field-testing kit by Aquagenx
      was used (CTB II).3

 Multi-Sectoral Nutrition
 Framework (Synergy Analysis)

    The multi-sectoral nutritional analysis (synergy analysis) was undertaken by Katja Vinha
    (Consultant, World Bank). A full report of this analysis is available upon request and part
    of the final package of the Democratic Republic of Congo WPD.




 Background and Econometric Model
 Malnutrition is prevalent in Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2013, 29 percent of children
 0–23 months of age were stunted, with higher prevalence rates in the rural than urban areas,
 32 and 21 percent, respectively. Children from households in the bottom 20 percent of the
 wealth distribution were more likely to be stunted than children from households in the top
 20 percent of the distribution, 33 and 15 percent, respectively. Since stunting, a measure of
 malnutrition, is associated with impaired cognitive function, lower economic productivity, and
 adverse health outcomes for self and, if female, for offspring (Victora et al. 2008), understanding
 the interplay of factors associated with stunting is of paramount interest. Furthermore, to
 efficiently focus efforts, it is necessary to identify the factors that in a given context are most
 effective in improving child nutrition.

 In 1990, UNICEF proposed a framework that presented nutrition as a function of three underlying
 determinants of food security, environment, and health, and childcare practices. Skoufias et al.
 (2015) have used an extension of the framework to analyze the correlation across different
 countries and the same methodology is used for Democratic Republic of Congo. The methodology
 allows for the identification of current data limitations, systematically explores the correlates
 and determinants of nutrition, identifies potentially “binding constraints” in reducing malnutrition
 and identifies potential interactions and synergies among different dimensions

 It is important to question whether or not some dimensions contribute more to nutrition than
 others and whether or not there are synergies among the dimensions. That is, it may be that
 having access to two of the four dimensions incurs additional benefit beyond any benefits from
 access to the dimensions in isolation. However, the extant empirical evidence for Democratic
 Republic of Congo provides a very partial picture regarding a young child’s nutritional status
 and adequate access to food security, environment, health, and child care.

 From a policy perspective, it is useful to have an understanding of which dimensions
 are correlated with better nutrition in specific contexts. Furthermore, if there are any
 synergies from access to a subset of the four dimensions, such relationships should
 be included in any potential benefits. The correlations are not only undertaken in the
 national context but also in urban–rural areas separately, as well as for children in the

       Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Framework
       The multi-sectoral nutrition framework classifies the causes of malnutrition into three hierarchical
       categories: the immediate causes, the underlying causes, and the basic causes. Identifying the
       immediate causes of malnutrition, that is disease or inadequate dietary intake, is useful for
       guiding policy actions, especially in situations of crisis. However, disease and inadequate
       dietary intake are the result of a variety of interrelated underlying factors. In the original
       framework, the underlying causes of malnutrition are themselves grouped into the three
       clusters: inadequate household food security; inadequate care and feeding practices; unhealthy
       household environment and inadequate health services. In figure V.1, the original model is
       extended and considers access to a healthy environment and to adequate health services
       separately. This is especially useful given that in many contexts different agencies have
       jurisdiction over infrastructure, such as sanitation and drinking water, and over health. Below,
       the underlying causes are the basic causes which summarize the social, cultural, economic,
       and political context, and the prevailing inequalities in the distribution of resources in society.

 Given that the underlying causes are the manifestation of the basic causes, they are prioritized
 in the analysis. However, any policy to improve nutritional outcomes would, in fact, need to
 address any inequalities or shortcomings in the basic causes.

 The first dimension of nutrition is access to adequate food security. A child is food secure when
 at all times, they have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious
 food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life (Food
 and Agriculture Organization, 2008). The ideal measure encompasses three broad factors.
 First, a comprehensive measure takes into account the availability of food. In general, this
 component measures the supply of food at the national (or regional) level and is based on
 agricultural production and food trade balance relative to the country’s size. Second, the
 measure captures the household-specific and individually specific access to the available food.
 That is, given household’s income and the prices of food at local markets, what range of food
 choices are available to the household, and, within the household, how is the food distributed.
 Third, the measure captures the quality of the actual food choices made by the household.
 That is, it measures whether or not the diet and cooking methods provide all the necessary
 micro- and macronutrients needed for healthy growth.

 The second dimension of nutrition is access to adequate care. This dimension measures the
 ability of the primary caregiver to provide a safe and appropriate environment for the child to
 grow and develop. Ideally, the measure is based on the child’s caregivers’ (i)  knowledge,
 practices, and beliefs regarding childcare; (ii) health and nutritional status; (iii) mental health,
 stress level, and self-confidence; (iv) autonomy and control of resources; (v) workload and time
 constraints; (vi) social support received from family and community.

 The third dimension is access to adequate environment (WASH). The dimension measures the
 child’s exposure to pathogens in the physical environment where they live. The measure is based
 on adjusted definitions adopted by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) and as part
 of monitoring the SDGs. It includes components on: (i)  access to improved drinking water;
 (ii)  access to improved sanitation; (iii)  adequate handwashing practices; and (iv)  adequate
 disposal of child’s feces. Given that it is not only the child’s immediate environment, i.e. the
 facilities in the dwelling unit, but also those in the immediate neighborhood that affect the degree
 of exposure to pathogens, communitywide access to improved sanitation is explored.

 The fourth dimension is access to adequate healthcare. This dimension measures the
 child’s access to skilled medical care to minimize the effects of illness and prevent health
 issues, especially those linked with malnutrition, such as diarrheal diseases. The measure
 encompasses the availability and use of healthcare services for prenatal, birth, and post-
 natal care.

 Contexts matter, such that the effect of lack of access to a specific dimension in one context
 may be quite different than in another context. For example, although access to potable water
 is important for all children, but for those 0–6 months of age who are exclusively breastfed and
 thus not directly consuming any water, such access may not be as important (or even necessary)
 from a purely nutritional standpoint. Alternatively, the interaction of the nutrition dimensions
 may look quite different in rural areas than in urban areas.

 Although the framework is a holistic way of conceptualizing nutrition it is also important to
 acknowledge the limitations of the classification scheme. Prices, knowledge, education,
 and household income all influence components of the three clusters of the framework,
 resulting in some overlap in the measures. The methodology is informative in finding the
 overall relationships, from which more focused and detailed analyses can be carried out to
 further investigate the underlying causes. So, for example, more detailed information would
 be needed to determine whether food inadequacies were due to the cost of food relative to
 income, to lack of information on the importance of diversified diet, or due to some other
 factor. The models estimated in this report are not reduced form models (taking into
 account budget constraints, etc.) as in Barrera (1990), but rather correlations between

       nutritional outcomes as measured by height-for-age Z-scores and having adequate access
       to the four dimensions on nutrition.


       Econometric Model
       To explore the relative importance of the nutrition dimensions and any potential synergies
       among the four underlying determinants and nutritional outcomes, a simple regression model
       is used to summarize the differences in the mean height-for-age among children with access
       to only one or more of the four nutritional dimensions. The analysis is purely descriptive,
       quantifying the correlation between height-for-age Z-scores and simultaneous access to
       adequate levels in more than one of the nutrition dimensions. The following description is
       based on Skoufias et al. (2015) with the modification that access to adequate environment is
       considered separately from access to adequate health care.

       The following econometric specification is estimated:
                                        4            4       4
                HAZ i = α + ∑ β j Aj + ∑                   ∑γ        jk   ( Aj ∗ Ak ) +
                                        j =1         j =1 k = j +1
                 4     4        4

       	        ∑∑ ∑γ                    jkm   ( Aj ∗ Ak ∗ Am ) + γ 1234 ( A1 ∗ A2 ∗ A3 ∗ A4 ) + ε i (V.1)
                j =1 k = j +1 m= j +2


       where HAZi is the height-for-age Z-score for child i, and Ai denotes access to the four adequacies,
       for each child i. Namely, A1 is 1 when the household is adequate in food and is 0 otherwise;
       A2 is 1 when the household is adequate in environment and is 0 otherwise; A3 is 1 when the
       household is adequate in health and is 0 otherwise; and, A4 is 1 when the household is
       adequate in care and is 0 otherwise. These binary variables are constructed without any
       consideration of whether the child has access to adequate levels in the other three clusters.
       It is also important to keep in mind that there are no additional control variables used in the
       regression because the objective here is simply to compare mean values in HAZ among
       children in these different sub-groups defined by the extent to which they have access to one
       or more of the pillars.

       In this specification, the constant term a provides an estimate of the mean value of HAZ
       scores for children without access to adequate food security (A¹= 0), adequate environment
       (A2= 0), adequate health (A3= 0), and adequate care (A4= 0). That is, the expected height-for-age
       for a child without access to any of the four dimensions is:1

       	       E(HAZi |A 1 = 0, A2 = 0, A3 = 0, A4 = 0) = a

       The coefficients bj yield estimates of the increase in the mean HAZ score of children when
       a  child has access to adequate levels in one of the dimensions only (and not the others).
       That is:

       	E(HAZi |A 1 = 1, A2 = 0, A3 = 0, A4 = 0) = a + b1
       	E(HAZi |A 1 = 0, A2 = 1, A3 = 0, A4 = 0) = a + b2
       	E(HAZi |A 1 = 0, A2 = 0, A3 = 1, A4 = 0) = a + b3
       	E(HAZi |A 1 = 0, A2 = 0, A3 = 0, A4 = 1) = a + b4(V.2)

       Specifically, the coefficient b1 yields an estimate of the increase in the mean HAZ score of
       children who have access to adequate food security only (A1 = 1) but do not have access to
       adequate environment, (A2 = 0), adequate health (A3 = 0) or adequate care (A4 = 0). The
       coefficients b2,b3, and b4 have analogous interpretations for environment, health, and care,
       respectively.

 The coefficients gjk yield estimates of the synergies or complementarities associated with
 having access to adequate levels in more than one of the cluster of underlying determinants
 of nutrition. Specifically, the mean HAZ score of children having access to adequate food
 security (A1= 1) and adequate environment (A2= 1) is summarized by the expression:

 	E(HAZi |A 1 = 1, A2 = 1, A3 = 0, A4 = 0) = a + b1 + b2 + g12(V.3)
 The expression for the mean value of HAZ scores of children in households with access to
 adequate food security and adequate environment consists of the sum of three components:
 the first component is the increase in HAZ scores associated with children in households with
 adequate food security only (i.e. b1); the second component (b2) is the increase in HAZ scores
 associated with children in households with adequate environment only, and the third component
 (g12) is the increase in HAZ scores associated with children in households that have access
 to  both adequate food security and adequate environment. Thus the coefficient g12 yields
 information on whether there are additional (extra) gains (or losses) in HAZ scores derived from
 simultaneous access. A significant and positive value of the coefficient g12 implies synergies
 from the simultaneous access to adequate food security and adequate environment in the
 production of child nutrition. The mean HAZ of children from having access to the other two
 adequacies (for example, food and care, or environment and care, etc.) are similarly defined.

 The mean HAZ of children from having access to three components (i.e. adequate food security
 (Ai1 = 1) and adequate environment (Ai2 = 1) and adequate health (Ai3 = 1)) is given by the
 expression:

 	(HAZi |A1 = 1, A2 = 1, A3 = 1, A4 = 0) = a + b1 + b2 + b3 + g12 + g13 + g23 + g123(V.4)

 with the coefficient g123 summarizing the potential synergies from simultaneous access to the
 three components. These are synergies in addition to any synergies from pairwise interactions.

 And similarly the mean HAZ of children from having access to all four components is given by
 the expression:

                                            a + b1 + b2 + b3 + b4 + g12 + g13 + g14 + g23 +
 	(HAZi |A 1 = 1, A2 = 1, A3 = 1, A4 = 1) = 
                                            g24 + g34 + g123 + g124 + g134 + g234 + g1234.(V.5)

 In the above model, in order to estimate the synergies, the indicator variables are non-exclusive,
 such that a child adequate in more than one nutritional dimension will have more than one
 indicator variable equaling one. In order to compare the average heights of a child with certain
 adequacies and a child with no adequacies, all relevant coefficients must be summed up. That
 is, the gj ’s values do not reflect the height differential between those with the adequacy set j
 with respect to children without access to any of the nutritional dimensions.

 Alternatively, it is possible to assign each child to exclusive groupings such that each child has
 only one indicator variable, Bj, equaling one. In this formulation, the coefficient estimates, lj,
 reflect these total height differentials between a child with a given set of adequacies and a
 child with none. Thus, the equation to be estimated can be written as

         a + l1B1 + l2B2 + l3B3 + l4B4 + l12B12 + l13B13 + l14B14 + l23B23 +
 	HAZi = 
         l24B24 + l34B34 + l123B123 + l124B124 + l134B134 + l234B234 + l1234B1234(V.6)

 where only one Bj will be equal to one and the rest will be equal to zero. So, a child adequate
 in food security but nothing else will have B1 = 1 and Bj = 0∀j ≠ 1, and a child adequate in food
 security and environment will have B12 = 1 and Bj = 0∀j ≠ 12 That is, the values of lj give the
 height differential for children with the adequacy set associated with j with respect to those
 who are not adequate in any dimension. When the adequacy groupings are completely
 specified the coefficient estimates from (V.1) can be rearranged to give the coefficient
 estimates in (V.6).2

 The model employed does not allow for causal inferences on the effects of having access to
 adequate levels in the various clusters adequacy components on nutrition nor provide a formal
 test of the UNICEF framework. A more rigorous causal analysis would require the use of
 methods aimed at addressing the endogeneity bias associated with the fact that many of the
 dimensions are to a large extent choice variables (e.g., a parent chooses to care for their child
 in a certain way or take the child to see a health care professional) as well as the inclusion of
 additional control variables aimed at reducing or eliminating the impact of other contextual
 variable omitted from the regression (omitted variable bias).

 Nevertheless, the estimates from the model serve as a useful benchmark for policy in terms
 of highlighting the potential gains that could be accomplished with having simultaneous access
 to adequate levels of various dimensions. This specification allows for the exploration of the

       patterns of correlation between the various adequacy measures and nutritional outcomes as
       measured by height-for-age. That is, the model estimates the correlation between adequacies
       and height-for-age for each set of adequacies based on information in one time period.

 Notes on WASH Variables
 Processing Across Surveys
 The Adjustment to Improved Sanitation
 DHS-EDS 2014, DHS 2007, and LSMS 2012 are used to calculate the adjustment factor for
 improved sanitation based on the average percentage shared of otherwise improved sanitation
 in urban and rural across these years. This is how the JMP makes this adjustment and this
 approach was followed in the present analysis.

 This ratio is then applied to urban and rural households, respectively, with improved sanitation
 (shared and unshared), to obtain the main variable to measure improved sanitation (named
 SanJMP2_imp). The same ratio is applied across all years included in the sanitation analysis
 (DHS-EDS 2014, DHS 2007, and LSMS 2012, LSMS 2005, and MICS 2001). The reasons that
 LSMS 2005 and MICS 2001 are not included in the calculation of the ratio is that for LSMS
 2005, there is some ambiguity in the pit latrine improved/not-improved category, so an estimate
 of improved sanitation is taken by counting pit latrines as unimproved in order to get a
 conservative estimate, but we do not want it to affect the adjustment factor. For MICS 2001,
 no question of shared or not was asked; the 2010 MICS is not used for any main sanitation
 calculations because of ambiguity.

 Two separate variables that show the true (i.e. reported for that year) improved, not shared
 [SanJMP4_imp]; improved, shared status of the household [SanJMP4_shared] have been
 generated. Note that for 2001, SanJMP4_imp represents all improved and SanJMP4_shared
 is missing because this question was not asked.

 In the main calculations of time series and poverty by improved, SanJMP2_imp is used
 (labeled  “adjusted” in the graphs). However, the Human Opportunity Index (HOI) and logit
 calculations use SanJMP4_imp as the improved variable in order to have a binary improved,
 not-improved variable (i.e. shared is considered unimproved here). Similarly, the access plus
 numbers use SanJMP4_imp to show the actual improved/not shared sanitation per year
 (leaving 2001 blank in addition to 2010).


 Differences from JMP
 The Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) uses regression to estimate the improved shared per year
 while the research team choose to calculate it using the numbers for each year, with the only
 cross-year imputation exception being the adjustment for sanitation.

                                          Differences from Global Team
                                          The research team proceeded to calculate sanitation figures with the LSMS 2005, in
                                          spite of the potential for ambiguity identified for improved/unimproved sanitation as a
                                          conservative estimate of improved shared (by fully counting the ambiguous pit category
                                          as unimproved).


                                          Urban
                                          Note that all calculations that are labeled with “urban”; “other urban” are urban areas outside
                                          of Kinshasa.


                                          Shares
                                          Shares are always population shares (never household shares). For example, the rate of
                                          improved access to water (percent) for female-headed households in the first decile is the
                                          population rate living in these households.


                                          Weights
                                          Calculations use the weights provided (household weight × household size) in MICs and
                                          DHS. For LSMS, the weights used are those provided by the Poverty Economist for the
                                          Democratic Republic of Congo. These weights have been corrected to be in line with the UN
                                          population projections.

                                          South Kivu and Maniema show very large changes between 2001 and 2014 in improved

 Note: Improved sanitation is all reported not shared in the reference year 2001 does not include a question for shared, so all improved are considered improved.




 Theory: different surveys are either defining or interpreting covered toilets differently (i.e. the
 same type of toilets are being recorded as both covered or uncovered, depending on the
 survey). Specifically, in MICS/DHS 2001, 2007, and 2014 uncovered is low/covered high;
 in LSMS 2005 and 2012 uncovered is high/covered is low. This is likely due to the lower
 bounds we are observing for LSMS.

 The fluctuation for Maniema follows this trend and may just have a more pronounced fluctuation
 than others as most change from year to year but the national average lessens this difference.

 However, the strange fluctuation in South Kivu is against trend and is a steady increase in
 unimproved. There may be something about these pit toilets that make it harder to classify
 than others (e.g., they are sometimes covered and sometimes not), but this is something that
 the team going into the field should specifically verify.


 Large Difference between Expenditure/Poverty
 Numbers and Wealth Index
 The poverty files provided by the Poverty Economist for the Democratic Republic of Congo only
 have expenditure already adjusted for spatial differences and poverty is also calculated based
 on these spatially adjusted expenditures. Meanwhile, the wealth index that DHS includes does
 not adjust for spatial differences. This likely explains the big differences between the urban/rural
 shares of the B40 when using one versus the other (along with other factors such as the
 wealth index being designed more with urban in mind than rural).

 Overview of Poverty
 Risk Model (PRM)

       The PRM analysis and report was prepared by the University of Florida (UF) and the
       London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) for the World Bank and led
       by Rick Rheingans (UF) and Oliver Cumming (LSHTM). This work is part of the WASH
       Poverty Diagnostic project led by Oxford Policy Management (Rheingans et al. 2016).
       The full report including references is available upon request.



 The primary purpose of this model is to describe how diverse and interrelated risk factors may
 contribute to how the national diarrheal disease burden is distributed between subpopulation
 groups (e.g., between wealth quintiles). We do not estimate the association or causality
 between WASH and these outcomes as the data is cross-sectional and prone to many biases.
 These descriptions are both quantitative (by economic group and setting) and spatial (through
 a series of heat maps showing intensity of risk) in nature. An understanding of the co-distribution
 of these risk factors will be used to identify the most consequential factors or combination of
 factors that require intervention.

 The core PRM model combines key “susceptibility factors” and “exposure factors” that are
 most relevant to the health outcome of interest: diarrhea. The relative risks (defined below;
 see methods) associated with these exposure and susceptibility factors are derived from
 published systematic review based meta-analyses as per conventional practice (Murray and
 Lopez 1997). The relative risks are not estimated in each setting due to insufficient context-
 specific literature for the various model parameters, but national-level data is used to inform
 the model. This approach is consistent with conventional burden of disease analyses.

 It is worth noting that the concept of a “relative risk” is a common and established approach
 in the epidemiological literature (Hennekens and Buring 1989; Levin 1953). It represents the
 level of disease risk among “exposed” individuals, those with a particular risk factor (e.g., not
 having safe drinking water) compared to “unexposed” individuals, those without that risk
 factor (e.g., having safe drinking water). A relative risk greater than 1.0 therefore shows a
 greater risk of a given disease among the exposed versus the unexposed and a relative risk
 of less than 1.0 by contrast shows that the risk factor among the exposed is protective
 against the disease. Relative risk estimates are derived from pooling the effect sizes of high-
 quality studies designed to assess the effect of a given factor on a given disease, such as the
 effect of safe drinking water on diarrheal disease. These studies should be identified using
 systematic review methods (Higgins and Green 2008) that limit investigator bias and the
 pooled effect—an average effect from across included studies—should be calculated using
 conventional and reproducible methods (Higgins and Green 2008) and the methods and
 results should be reported as per conventional best practice (Moher et al. 2015).

 The conceptual framework for the WASH-PRM is explained in figure X.1. The “Exposure Factors”
 section of the figure includes WASH-related elements that influence the risk of diarrheal disease.
 Relative risks are developed from the literature for different levels of these WASH services.
 Relative risks for individual exposure risk factors are combined into a single “exposure index”.

       Note: WASH/Exposure Factors in light green are not included in the Exposure Index.



       The “Susceptibility Factors” section of the conceptual framework addresses individual risk
       factors that have been identified through rigorous evaluations and meta-analyses. Quantitative
       risk estimates for each factor are combined into a single “susceptibility index”. We also include
       explorations of other potentially important exposure factors (shown in light green in figure X.1;
       described in Table 3 in Section 2) that are not included in the core model in this report (listed
       in Section 0). They are not included in the base model due to inconclusive evidence of the
       magnitude of excess risk or lack of data on conditions and behaviors.

       The model further assumes that patterns of susceptibility and exposure patterns differ within
       and between countries based on geography and economic conditions. The patterns and
       correlations between these risk factors are assessed through household survey data in each
       context. Overall, the WASH-PRM assesses patterns of disease risk across economic and
       geographic subpopulations by combining rigorous estimates of the effects of exposure and
       susceptibility factors with country-specific data on the distribution of these risk factors.


       Methods
       Defining Exposure Risk Factors
       As described in the conceptual diagram (figure X.1), we consider water and sanitation as
       “exposure” factors, that is, as independent variables that influence our dependent outcomes
       of interest (diarrheal disease, diarrheal mortality, and stunting).

       Under the MDG target for water and sanitation, access to these two services was classified as
       “improved” or “unimproved”, with progress on improved services contributing to progress in
       meeting the MDG target. This binary classification of water and sanitation into masks a gradient
       of ascending service levels that bring differing levels of health and other benefits. More recently,
       the WASH sector has moved to a ‘service ladder’ approach that better describes water and
       sanitation access as a continuum of ascending levels assumed to bring ascending benefits.
       The new SDG to “ensure access to water and sanitation for all” by 2030 goes beyond
       unimproved/improved to call for safely managed water and sanitation services.

       In understanding the risk posed by inadequate water and sanitation access to different groups,
       it is important to consider multiple service level or “exposure” scenarios which distinguish
       between, for example, improved sanitation and a sewer connection, and allow for different

       Box X.1: Relative Risk and the WASH Risk Index

       What does “Relative Risk” mean?

       Relative Risk (RR) is a concept commonly used in public health and epidemiology to
       quantify how a particular risk factor (for example, having an improved water source)
       may increase or decrease the risk of a specific health outcome, compared to a
       baseline. An RR of less than 1 means a factor is protective in comparison to not
       having it. An RR greater than 1 means that it results in an increase in risk.

       We use RR information on various factors related to childhood health and diarrhea,
       some of which increase risk, while others decrease it. The quantitative estimates of
       RR are drawn from rigorous studies designed to assess causal effects within the
       published literature.

       Developing a WASH Risk Index

       A key part of the WASH-PRM is the development of a WASH Risk Index. This index is
       based on the conceptual model in figure X.1. The index combines quantitative
       information on household WASH and health to quantify the relative risk of adverse
       child health outcomes due to inadequate WASH.

       How is it calculated?

       The index is calculated at the level of the child. The index combines information on the
       child’s household WASH characteristics, individual health vulnerabilities, and the relative
       risk associated with each factor. The RRs for each factor are multiplied together to
       develop a cumulative risk index. Some risk factors (for example, improved water, access
       to vitamin A) decrease risk. Others (for example, underweight) increase risk. It is
       important to note that the weight of each factor is neither equal nor arbitrary. The weight
       of each is based on what the evidence in the literature provides as a relative risk.

       The relative risk scores are combined into an Exposure Index (WASH variables) and
       a Susceptibility Index (health-related factors), and these two indices comprise the
       combined Risk Index.




 relative risks of a given health outcome for each exposure level. Many systematic reviews pool
 different water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions to arrive at a single relative risk estimate
 for all interventions within a given category (water, sanitation, and hygiene) against a single
 counter-factual of “no intervention,” often failing to account for differences in service level and
 the control.

 Two previous efforts to assign relative risks (RR) to various WASH exposure scenarios applied
 literature-based estimates to an ascending level of single and then multiple WASH services,
 but only distinguished between one or two levels of water and sanitation service (Cairncross
 and Valdmanis 2006; Prüss et al. 2002). For the WASH-PRM, we will adopt the exposure
 scenarios and accompanying RR estimates proposed in a recent WHO-led burden of disease
 analysis. These RRs are determined using a meta-analysis based on a systematic review of

 various WASH interventions corresponding to the different exposure scenarios, or service
 levels (Table X.1; Prüss-Ustün et al. 2014)

 We assign exposure scenarios based on the coverage of water and sanitation service levels
 using data from the 2013–2014 Democratic Republic of Congo DHS (See map X.1 for survey
 sites). We define service levels with a desire to align where possible with the World Bank
 Access Plus framework and use three service levels for both water and sanitation (Table X.1)
 that can be combined to describe a number of exposure scenarios with varying degrees of
 diarrheal disease risk (table 3.3).


 Water

 We exclude ‘point-of-use’ water treatment scenarios due to the challenges of estimating
 adequate compliance and the questionable reliability of the RR estimates. We use three
 exposure scenarios from the DHS to estimate water source coverage: unimproved water, off-
 plot or community improved water source, and on-plot improved (including piped) water source
 (Table X.1). Water sources were grouped into scenarios using the DHS household-level data
 and JMP MDG water ladder definitions. Water source coverage was then estimated at the
 cluster (“community”) level using all households and then combined with the child-level data
 and used to calculate the exposure index.


 Sanitation

 We use all three exposure scenarios for sanitation proposed by Wolf and colleagues (Prüss-
 Ustün et al. 2014): unimproved sanitation (including open defecation), improved no sewer
 (on-site), and sewer connection (reticulated, off-site). Each scenario was defined using the
 classification of toilet type and reported household sharing from the DHS household-level data.
 Sanitation coverage was then estimated at the cluster (“community”) level using all households
 and combined with child-level data to calculate the exposure index.

 We derived sanitation definitions in accordance with the JMP MDG sanitation ladder. Category
 A included open defecation and unimproved, any shared improved toilet or latrine and pour/
 flush toilets that flush to “somewhere else.” Category B includes unshared improved toilets or
 latrines and pour/flush toilets that flush to “don’t know where.” Category C includes unshared
 pour/flush toilets that are connected to piped sewer.

                               Scores for the exposure index are calculated individually for each child based on the combined
                               RRs of each water and sanitation access scenario (table X.2; equation X.1). The value for each
                               child is based on the household’s access to water and sanitation facilities. Exposure values
                               are then estimated for each child, then averaged by cluster using survey weights included in
                               DHS datasets. After calculating the exposure index, we then adjusted it to excess exposure
                               risk due to inadequate WASH by subtracting 1.00 from the relative risk value.

                               In addition to water and sanitation scenarios, we present DHS data to characterize disparities
                               in other hygiene factors related to diarrheal disease (table X.3). While these are important for
                               exposure, their contribution to exposure risk has not been characterized through rigorous
                               studies. However, this does not undermine how important they are for limiting child exposure
                               to diarrheal disease.

                               Improved hand washing and safe water treatment are defined using the household-level DHS
                               data (table X.3). A household has improved handwashing facilities if they meet three criteria
                               present in the household-level data in the DHS: (i) having a designated place for hand
                               washing that is stocked with (ii) water and (iii) soap, mud, or ash. Improved or safe water
                               treatment is defined by treating household water with an effective method for decontaminating
                               drinking water.

 Safe or improved child stool disposal is defined using the child-level DHS data. Improved
 child stool disposal is when the respondent reports that the child either directly uses an
 improved toilet facility or child stool is rinsed or disposed into an improved toilet facility
 (table X.3).

 Population density estimates from the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) were used
 to assess the effects of community-level sanitation (Wof et al. 2014). These provide 1
 square kilometer resolution estimates of population density. We used GPW estimates that
 have been adjusted using UN population projections. We overlaid DHS cluster locations
 on GPW population density raster maps and extracted density estimates for each cluster.
 We also calculated “population density without sanitation” as a proxy measure for the
 relative amount of human waste potentially being released into the environment. We used
 the product of improved sanitation coverage and population density as a measure of
 community-level contamination. In order to calculate this variable, population density
 cluster estimates were combined with cluster improved sanitation (Category B and C,
 table X.1) coverage to describe the co-distribution of individual child and community
 sanitation risk (table X.3).


 Defining Susceptibility Risk Factors
 The model includes three risk factors related to susceptibility of diarrheal disease and mortality.

 These include acquisition of susceptibility-related micronutrients (vitamin A), effective treatment
 (for example, oral rehydration), and undernutrition assessed by child weight-for-age (WFA)
 (table X.4).


 Undernutrition

 For undernutrition, we use RRs from Caulfield et al., which estimated the RR of cause-specific
 mortality (including diarrhea) for different levels of stunting (low height-for-age), wasting (low
 weight-for-height), and underweight (WFA).

 We estimate RRs based on WFA Z-scores recorded for under five children in the child-level DHS
 data (table X.4). RRs are assigned to different levels of WFA based on standard deviations (SD)
 below the global mean of the Z-score distribution (−1 to −2 SD, −2 to −3 SD, and less than −3 SD)
 compared to normal (greater than −1 SD). For the diarrheal risk model, we use the estimates for
 low WFA on diarrheal mortality as a likely measure of long- and short-term undernutrition effects.
 We use reported RRs for each level to estimate a piece-wise linear risk function that provides a
 continuous estimate of excess risk as WFA Z-scores decline (table X.4).


 Oral Rehydration Treatment

 There is substantial evidence of the effect of oral rehydration treatment (ORT) on the severity
 and duration of diarrhea. Based on 157 studies, Munos et al. (2010) estimated a 93 percent
 reduction in diarrhea mortality with ORT use (pre-packaged or home remedy). We combine this
 estimate with an estimated probability of receiving ORT, calculated using child-level DHS data
 (table X.4). Data on ORT are only available for children who have had a diarrheal episode in the
 previous two weeks. If analyses were restricted to these observations, the coverage of analyses
 would become very sparse, and likely bias or underestimate the occurrence of diarrhea. Rather
 than including whether a child received ORT for a recent diarrheal episode (during the last two
 weeks), we estimate the propensity for receiving ORT given household wealth quintile, maternal
 education, region, setting, and child age. Values for children without a recent episode are
 imputed using a logistic regression model built on data from children who did have an episode.
 Imputing values for all children results in a more widespread estimate of the likelihood of
 receiving ORT.

 Vitamin A

 Imdad et al. examined the effect of vitamin A supplementation on diarrheal mortality, as well
 as outcomes related to pneumonia and measles. Based on 12 studies with data on diarrhea-
 specific mortality, they estimated a pooled effect of ~30 percent reduction due to vitamin A
 supplementation (RR  =  0.70; CI: 0.58−0.86) among children 6–59 months of age. This
 estimate is incorporated in the susceptibility estimates using child-level DHS data on whether
 or not the child received a vitamin A dose.


 Susceptibility Index

 Scores for the susceptibility index are calculated individually for each child based on the
 combined RRs of each of the three susceptibility factors (table X.5). The susceptibility index
 (SusIndexi) is designed to be proportional to the excess risk associated with all of the factors
 (equation X.2).

 	                            SusIndexi = ∏ ∑ RR j ,k . RiskFactori, j ,k 	(X.2)

 Where RRj,k is the relative risk associated with the jth level of risk factor k. RiskFactori,j,k is the
 level of that risk factor for individual i. For vitamin A supplementation, there is only two levels
 (yes or no) and RiskFactori,j,k serves as a dummy variable. For the other risk factors, the levels
 are continuous. Susceptibility values are estimated for each child subpopulation using
 appropriate survey weights included in DHS datasets.


 Combined Risk Index

 Susceptibility (SusIndexi)and exposure risk (ExpIndexi) are combined into the overall risk index
 (RiskIndexi), which is simply the product of the two indices (Equation X.3). Risk index scores
 are calculated individually for each child under five years of age and then aggregated into
 subpopulation estimates.

 	RiskIndexi = ExpIndexi · SusIndexi(X.3)

 Data Analyses1
 Data on the distribution of diarrheal susceptibility and exposure risk factors comes from
 available DHS surveys. DHSs are implemented countrywide in middle- to low-income countries
 and survey a wide range of health and socioeconomic characteristics. Surveys are released
 with data on geographic locations and include both household- and individual-level datasets.
 Households are selected using stratified sampling methods that require accounting for complex
 survey design. The following sections describe the graphs and figures that will be used to
 display the analysis.


 Density Plots

 These graphs show the distributions of variables of interest using probability densities. The
 area under each curve is equal to one, and represents the relative density of probability that a
 member of the wealth quintile has the corresponding value along the x-axis.


 Concentration Curves

 These graphs show the distributions of outcomes across a ranked cumulative fraction of the
 population, in this study, socioeconomic status. The x-axis shows the cumulative wealth fraction

       from the poorest percentiles on the left, to the entire population on right and shows the fraction
       of a given outcome (y-axis) associated with the population up to each cumulative wealth level.
       This is plotted against a 45° line of equity, where the poorest 40 percent have 40 percent of
       outcomes, extending all the way up the wealth continuum. While they do not show actual
       coverage values for risk factors, they do highlight where disparities in risk factor coverage are
       most prominent.


       Scatterplot Matrices

       The lower half of these figures show a series of pairwise x–y scatter plots showing the co-
       distribution of different WASH risk factors and indices for urban and rural children. The upper
       half shows two-dimensional contour plots of the pairwise co-distributions of variables and
       indices from the WASH-PRM. Many of the individual risk factors are categorical and therefore
       not easily represented. In these cases, scatters show the cluster-level proportions and means,
       rather than individual values.


       Poverty and Economic Status
       Asset-based wealth and consumption metrics both reflect urban and rural poverty differently.
       The differences in both lifestyle and access to assets between urban and rural populations
       can be masked when wealth quintiles are calculated at a national level. Asset-based wealth
       metrics rely on individual goods (such as bicycles) or construction materials (such as thatch
       roofs), which have very different meaning and value in rural versus urban settings. National
       quintiles can obscure the condition of the urban poor, who are grouped into the third or
       fourth national quintiles. While their assets may group them into higher wealth quintiles as
       compared to rural populations, they may not experience a higher standard of living equal to
       their higher ranking. Asset-based indices (as are used in DHS to determine household
       wealth) result in rural households being grouped into the middle and lower national quintiles,
       while urban households are grouped into the middle and upper quintiles. Failing to account
       for urban and rural differences can obscure important underlying patterns between wealth
       and health. We computed national, urban, and rural wealth quintiles, and ranked urban and
       rural households separately by wealth quintiles. The categorization of quintiles for urban
       and rural populations is based on the distribution of the asset scores for the urban and
       rural populations, respectively, rather than the national distribution, thus they must not be
       interpreted as equivalent.


       Geospatial analyses
       One of the key objectives of the WASH-PRM is to show the geographic distribution and co-
       distribution of risk factors and impact. This includes mapping of individual risk factors and
       cumulative measures (e.g., exposure, susceptibility, and risk indices). Our maps identify regions
       that experience high levels of exposure, susceptibility, and diarrheal risk and other important
       outcomes. We show these outcomes at national and regional scales, and for different economic
       levels (B40 and T60).

       We interpolated exposure, susceptibility, and risk indices for the national-level maps, as well as
       for the B40 and T60. We calculated cluster-level averages of the three indices. Using ARCGIS
       10.2.2, we utilized empirical Bayesian krigingto interpolate a high-resolution (5 square
       kilometers) risk surface. Standard kriging approaches use a regression-type linear model to
       predict values at unmeasured locations on a surface using an average of values near the point
       in question. Empirical Bayesian kriging uses the underlying sample distribution to inform the
       model’s priors and covariance functions, whereas most other kriging measures assume an
       underlying Gaussian distribution, which is often not the case in datasets. These high-resolution
       maps provide an initial rapid assessment of important trends in diarrheal disease-related
       factors.

 DALY Burden of Inadequate WASH

 The WASH-PRM estimates the distribution of child diarrhea and enteric infections due to
 inadequate WASH. The estimates also account for variability in child susceptibility through
 undernutrition or lack of medical care. These have been expressed above as measures of the
 risk index. However, in this section these estimates are translated into the more commonly
 used measures of DALYs, developed and used by the Global Burden of Disease project (GBD).

 DALYs are a common health metric that combines both the years of life lost due to a particular
 cause or risk factor with the years lived with disability. For diarrhea and enteric disease among
 children under five years of age, the vast majority (approximately 90 percent) of the DALY
 burden is YLL due to premature mortality. A single DALY can be considered as one year of
 healthy life lost. As a summary measure that can be calculated across diverse causes or risk
 factors, including those that might cause death (such as road traffic accidents) and/or those
 which do not death but may cause chronic disability (e.g., back pain, or trichiasis). As such,
 DALYs permit comparison between diverse health conditions and provide a useful summary
 statistic of disease burden for a given population.

 Here, we use DALYs to provide a summary estimate for the distribution of the enteric disease
 burden attributable to inadequate WASH by subpopulation groups. For this exercise, we use
 DALY estimates from the 2013 GBD which are available online.

 Health burden causes are broken down in the GBD into different categories of communicable
 and non-communicable diseases. Here we use the estimates for diarrheal disease (category
 A.2.1 from the GBD data portal website; see reference and intestinal infectious diseases
 (category A.2.2 from GBD data portal website). It is important to point out that this captures
 the burden of short-term morbidity and mortality, but does not account for any potential of
 enteric infections on undernutrition or long-term consequences.

 We start by translating the WASH-PRM risk index into a DALY burden rate (DALYs per 100,000
 children). The WASH risk index represents the relative excess risk associated with inadequate
 WASH and the first step is to convert it into a measure of overall risk of diarrhea and enteric
 infections (and not just the excess due to poor WASH). This involves recalculating an overall
 exposure index that is not adjusted for the excess risk. This is done by using the original
 relative risk numbers from the literature and not subtracting 1 from the RR to create an excess
 RR. This has the effect of turning the exposure index (risk index) into a measure of the overall
 enteric disease risk, rather than just the portion attributable to inadequate WASH.

 The second step is to convert this revised enteric risk index into a DALY equivalent. We make
 the assumption that the relative distribution of the risk index is an appropriate estimate of the
 distribution of the DALY burden. Using the GBD estimate as our national burden envelope, we
 create a risk-burden multiplier using the following equation:

                                             NatEnterDALY
 	                                RBMult =                       (X.4)
                                              EntRiskIndi
 This establishes a ratio between risk index and DALY burden that maintains the national GBD
 burden estimate. We then use the multiplier to estimate an individual-level expected DALY
 burden for each child. These values can then the aggregated by geographic and economic
 subpopulations.

 	EntDALYi = RBMult · EntRiskIndi                                                           (X.5)

 	WASHDALYi = RBMult · WASHRiskindi                                                         (X.6)

 EntDALYi represents the burden for individual i from diarrheal and enteric infections based on
 the individual exposure and susceptibility variables. The sum of EntDALYi over the population

       is the same as the GBD diarrheal and enteric infection burden. WASHDALYi represents the
       portion of this burden associated with inadequate WASH service levels. As with the GBD
       burden, these individual estimates are rates expressed as DALYs per 100,000 children.

       These burden estimates for individual children are then aggregated to subpopulation levels
       (e.g., region, urban vs. rural residence, and wealth quintile) using survey statistics as above.
       The appropriately weighted means for the subpopulations represent the expected DALYs per
       100,000 children per year. For these measures, we focus on the distribution of the total enteric
       burden and burden associated with inadequate WASH.

            Use of National, Urban, and Rural Wealth Quintiles

            Figure BX.2.1 presents data by wealth quintile in different ways. National quintiles are
            the easiest to understand, with all households being divided into groups representing
            20% of the population. This is a standard way to describe the bottom 20 (B20) or
            bottom 40 (B40), and top 60 (T60). One of the challenges with national groupings is
            that the poorest urban households are often grouped into the middle or fourth quintile
            based on their housing characteristic, which may overstate their wealth. Similarly,
            some of the richest rural households are categorized as the middle quintile.

       We calculate rural and urban quintiles separately by first dividing the population into
       urban and rural and then ranking these two sub-populations by wealth score and
       finally segmenting into quintiles. Separating urban and rural quintiles allows us to
       identify inequalities within the urban and rural sub-populations that might otherwise
       be missed.
