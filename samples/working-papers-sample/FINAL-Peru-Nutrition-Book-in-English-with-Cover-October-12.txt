This book tells the story of how Peru more than halved its high rates of stunting among under-five in less than a decade.


Great minds came together after persistent efforts from civil society to take concrete and affective actions. Widespread
understanding and awareness about the devastating effects of chronic malnutririon was created thanks to a superb
communication strategy. All the while ‘stunting’ remained on the political agenda as a serious human development and economic
issue.


Resource flows and existing programs were reviewed and reformed while budget was reallocated to those areas with the highest
burden problems. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Economy and Finance’s result based approach to spending resources on
nutrition, sectors converged and worked toward a common goal. The importance of real time data and well-functioning systems
was recognized early and action taken.


Parents, local governments, and health professionals were encouraged, using clever nudging techniques, to seek and provide
better nutrition and health services and change behaviour towards better feeding practices for children in their first 1,000 days
of life.


Chronic malnutrition often results in stunted children who will suffer the negative consequences of being stunted, with a stunted
brain being the most devastating consequence. Peru recognized its children are its future, made fighting chronic malnutrition
everyone's business and took long-lasting good governance political decisions.


Peru more than halved its stunting rates in eight years from 28 percent in 2008 to 13 percent in 2016.


This book is about how Peru did that.

   Chapter Snapshot


   •	   In 2005, 28 percent of preschool children suffered from chronic malnutrition. This rate had hardly changed for over
        a decade.
   •	   Poverty, lack of awareness and lack of access to quality social and health services led to particularly high rates of
        stunting in remote, rural areas. Inefficient feeding programs failed to dent this.
   •	   Economic growth, urbanization, women's education and improved access to water helped reduce poverty and
        contributed to reducing stunting rates but these developments alone were not enough.
   •	   The percentage of Peruvians living below the poverty line more than halved from 58.7 percent in 2004 to 22.7 percent
        in 2014.
   •	   Prosperity played a part in Peru's success in reducing stunting but it was targeted policies that played a pivotal role
        in changing mindsets and meals.

Note: This figure illustrates the effects of stunting on white matter tracts. Specifically, diffusion weighted imaging was used to
examine a variety of white matter fibers in a single stunted infant (top frame) and a single non-stunted infant (bottom frame),
at 2-3 months of age. As is apparent, the density and richness of this network of fibers is far more elaborate in the non-stunted
infant than in the stunted infant. It is important to keep in mind that this is but a single (albeit representative) infant. Thus, until
these findings are replicated at the group level, such findings should be considered preliminary. This data was collected as
part of an ambitious program of research taking place in Dhaka, Bangladesh (Charles A. Nelson, Ph.D., Principle Investigator),
supported by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The goal of this work is to examine the effects of biological and psychosocial
adversity on early brain development. Nadine Gaab, Ph.D. and her colleagues are overseeing the MRI portion of this project.

  The GRADE-model suggests that while mothers' education and height turned out to be important explanatory variables, some effects were also associated
with vaccination and pre-natal controls. Little effect was associated with CRED (possibly because of the quality of the counseling). Access to water was also
found to be significant and important while the strongest effect was related to household income and the community or the enabling environment. Mothers'
height and education, as well as birth order were associated with a stronger effect among age sub-groups, similarly, vaccinations (during the first year) and

      Chapter Snapshot


      •	    The launch in 2005 of the CCT program Juntos provided financial incentives to mothers to visit clinics with their
            children in rural areas for health checks.
      •	    The program raised demand for preventive health and nutrition services, encouraging mothers to change health,
            nutrition and hygiene practices.
      •	    The launch of Crecer5 in 2007, the national strategy for combating poverty and chronic malnutrition in children,
            focused on more cost-effective social spending by consolidating health and nutrition programs with an emphasis
            on maternal-child health, birth registration and access to social services.
      •	    Spending focused on "key interventions:" vaccinations to reduce childhood infections, monitoring and promoting the
            growth of infants and young children, as well as feeding and hygiene practices in the family home.
      •	    The government targeted the poorest areas with the highest rates of stunting, set clear targets and doubled
            spending to implement the strategy.

  The term "proxy means test" is used to describe a situation where information on household or individual characteristics correlated with welfare levels is used
in a formal algorithm to proxy household income, welfare or need (Grosh and Baker, 1995).

  The evidence about the impact of the Juntos program on child stunting is mixed. Escobal and Benites (2012) cannot find conclusive evidence about the
association between the decline in stunting and participation in the Juntos program. Sánchez and Jaramillo (2012) concluded that Juntos is associated with
reductions in severe stunting among beneficiary children younger than five, and that the reduction of both moderate and severe stunting was most prevalent
among children of more educated mothers. Similar conclusions were presented in a more recent paper by Sanchez, Melendez, and Behrman (2016) that found
no effects on stunting overall, but large effects on severe stunting for siblings of children who were exposed to Juntos as children younger than three years old.

  1,000 days' window refers to the period between conception and a child's second birthday. This is approximately 1,000 days and is considered as a crucially
important period for brain development and within which stunting is reversible. The 1,000 days are the most critical time for positive impact on a child's
cognitive and physical development.

Result-Based Budgeting allowed for focus on results, value for money and
ringfenced budgets from 2008


   Chapter Snapshot


   •	   Moving to Result-Based Budgeting (RBB) in 2008 was a watershed for investing in nutrition as it created a rigorous
        approach to allocating spending to achieve results in children's health, growth and development.
   •	   Only the most cost-effective and globally proven ways of reducing stunting were allocated money.
   •	   Real time individualized data, as well as regular household and demographic surveys and birth registration, played
        a critical role in evaluating priorities and progress.
   •	   Regional health authorities were rewarded with an increase in their budgets if they achieved development targets,
        including on chronic malnutrition, sanitation and water.
   •	   Stunting became a shared national responsibility and priority across government with public officials trained to
        understand how to tackle the problem.

   The Convenios were supported by the EUROPAN project and established a fixed and a variable tranche. Fixed tranche disbursements were linked to fulfillment
of administrative/logistical processes needed to implement the PAN (including strengthening operational capacities of budget units). Variable tranches
were disbursed against achievements of pre-established targets in coverage (percentage of children with immunizations; percentage of children with CRED;
percentage of children affiliated to SIS, etc.).

     International evidence helped convince stakeholders to prioritize to 2 out of 20 vaccines.

     Chapter Snapshot


     •	   Political continuity in the fight against malnutrition was vital in lowering stunting rates with the issue on the political
          agenda in three successive elections: 2006, 2011 and 2016.
     •	   From 2011, the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS) took charge of coordinating the national
          campaign to curb chronic malnutrition.
     •	   The Ministry launched a new early child development program and closed an inefficient government agency
          responsible for food distribution.
     •	   A new Performance Incentive Fund was created to reward the delivery of a complete package of services to children.

   PRONAA was created in 1992 to provide food assistance to rural and isolated areas. PRONAA typically distributed a food package that included rice, soup,
cereals and vegetable oil (Alcazar, 2007). In 2012 PRONAA was closed due to significant deficiencies that pointed to problems of low coverage and high
inclusion errors, sub-optimal planning, purchasing, delivery and storage processes causing delays and incomplete rations, and a big difference between the
amount of food delivered and the amount effectively consumed by the beneficiaries (MIDIS, 2013). A new program, Qali Warma, was created immediately to
replace feeding programs for school-aged children. It worked in collaboration with local communities and promoted local food diversity. These programs do
not benefit children during the window of opportunity of the first 1,000 days to prevent stunting but they can be helpful in providing implicit transfers to poor
families, encouraging school attendance and providing a vehicle for nutrition for school children.

   Tropical enteropathy or environmental enteropathy is a condition or subclinical disorder believed to be due to frequent intestinal infections. There are
often minimal acute symptoms but there may be chronic problems with absorbing nutrients which may result in malnutrition in children. Environmental
enteropathy results in changes in the intestines, including increased permeability and inflammatory cell build-up within the intestines. These changes result
in poor absorption of food, vitamins and minerals.

Political Commitment
"When malnutrition is so high in your country and you were not informed about it, your
soul rebels and you ask yourself: 'What can I do about it?'" said former Prime Minister Jorge
del Castillo. "I could not accept that more than a quarter of Peruvian children
were in that situation."


Smarter Policies
"The change to result-based management led not only to a better allocation of financial
resources but also to a change in organizational culture not only within MEF but also in
the entities that needed to understand that the goal of the resources we were assigning
had a final purpose: that was to achieve changes in the lives of people," said Rodolfo
Acuña, Director of Public Budget at the Ministry of Economy and Finance.


Changing behaviors
"You realize there is a change in the country, especially when parents talk to you with
pride about how big their kids are today, how they are growing, how strong they are,
how tall they are. That sense of pride shows they value the interventions, that there is
a transformation in the lives od these families," said Carolina Trivelli, the first Minister
of MIDIS.
