       Strategic Framework

       While political support for workforce development (WfD) as an asset for economic
       progress is strong, and the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders are clear, the
       influence of businesses and industries in shaping and implementing workforce
       development priorities is limited. Though the Turkish Cypriot community (TCc) has
       been partnering with international donors to improve its workforce development
       system, assessments are not conducted routinely on the community's economic
       prospects and their implications for skills. Besides, the law does not provide for skills
       upgrades in the informal sector.


       System Oversight

       Equity and efficiency of funding is an issue for the community, as no strong linkages
       exist between the allocation of funds and the performance of service providers.
       Besides, the funding of educational institutions has generally not been supplemented
       by other sources. While competency standards exist for most occupations, the
       community should continue benefitting from European Union alignment, and
       institutionalize clear and attainable standards for domestic quality-assurance systems.


       Service Delivery

       Performance targets for public training providers and corresponding incentives for
       meeting those targets are currently underutilized. Bad performers are not informed or
       incentivized to improve their functioning. The availability and use of policy-relevant
       data is very limited, and monitoring and evaluation are not given the deserved
       attention. Establishing an integrated Management Information System for
       employment and education inputs and outcomes could serve as a first step toward
       developing an evidence-based, strategic-thinking environment for the Turkish Cypriot
       community.

Executive Summary
For the last 50 years, the Turkish Cypriot community (TCc) has remained outside the effective control of the Government
of the Republic of Cyprus (RoC). The community displays typical characteristics and challenges of a small island economy,
and after years of rapid growth and income convergence, it is unlikely to replicate its pre-2009 economic performance in
the medium term. While the overall unemployment rate declined to 8.4 percent in 2013, labor market indicators such as
employment rates and participation have not benefitted enough from the period of high growth and convergence, and
some vulnerabilities have emerged. The community’s public sector, which accounts for about 30 percent of total
employment, provides employees with generous benefits and thereby attracts large number of well-educated Turkish
Cypriots. However, the private sector tends to generate low-paying, low value-added jobs, mostly in small, family-run
firms, making it a fairly unattractive option to the large pool of local unemployed youth, recent graduates, and inactive
people.

Sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, thus, become all the more crucial if the community is to regain the
growth momentum of the early-2000s and address some of the labor market issues described above. Structural reforms
should, among other things, aim to remove barriers to an expanding private sector, and strengthen domestic and external
market competitiveness. To do this, the Turkish Cypriot community needs to better align its workforce and workforce
development (WfD) policies to the needs of the labor market and of the private sector in particular.

The study benchmarks policies and practices in the community’s workforce development system against international
good practices. Specifically, it assesses policies, practices and institutional arrangements, and identifies measures that
contributed to workforce development. The study takes advantage of the World Bank’s workforce development diagnostic
tool, which is part of the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative. The SABER-WfD assessed three
broad functional dimensions of the community’s workforce development policies based on a collection of primary and
secondary evidence on performance in these three areas: strategic framework; system oversight; and service delivery.

The strategic framework dimension is concerned with setting the direction and overall authorizing environment for
workforce development. While political support is strong for viewing workforce development as an asset for economic
progress, and the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders are clear, businesses and industries have limited influence
in shaping and implementing workforce development priorities in the Turkish Cypriot community. Employers are only
involved in defining such priorities on an ad hoc basis. Community administrations have been partnering with international
donors to improve the system, but assessments of the community’s economic prospects and their implications for skills
are not conducted routinely. Besides, laws and regulations make it impossible for informal sector workers to participate
in any skills-upgrading program.

System oversight refers to the standards and quality assurance that guide the functioning of the system. The results reveal
that equity in funding is an issue for the community, as no strong linkages exist between the allocation of funds to
education institutions and their performance. Besides, funding of educational institutions has generally not been
supplemented by other sources. Competency standards exist for most occupations. However, domestic quality-assurance
systems need improvement.

Service delivery refers to how training is conducted to equip individuals with market and job-relevant skills. The influence
of “non-public” stakeholders over training curricula is ad hoc, and almost no incentives exist for public and private service
providers to meet quality standards. The availability and use of policy-relevant data are very limited, and Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) activities are not given the deserved attention. Establishing an integrated Management Information
System for employment and education inputs and outcomes could comprise the first step toward developing an evidence-
based, strategic-thinking environment for the TCc.

The main challenges facing the community in the coming years will be linking WfD to broader socioeconomic goals, and
strengthening mechanisms for funding and quality assurance, as well as M&E programs and policies.

 Box 1--Placing the TCc in the international SABER-WfD context
 The first message coming out of the analysis is that the TCc SABER WfD scores are somewhat lower than one would expect given
 its per capita GDP, but not excessively so. According to an unpublished World Bank report, the Turkish Cypriot community
 registered a score of 2.5 in terms of strategic framework, 2.0 for system oversight, and 1.9 for service delivery, and, in 2008, had a
 per capita GDP of US $15-23,000, measured in constant 2005 US$ . That puts the TCc well below the regression lines in all three
 policy areas, and below countries of similar income levels in the graph.

 Second, the TCC’s scores for strategy are higher than those for the other two functional dimensions—a dynamic seen in other
 economies where the SABER-WfD has been carried out. This pattern is evident from the location of the regression line for the
 strategy dimension in the figure, compared with those for oversight and service delivery. The hierarchy is intuitive: By their nature,
 the actions associated with strategy involve fewer agents and tend to require fewer steps to go from ideas to implementation.
 Moving from a low score to a higher score for strategy is thus more easily accomplished than would be the case for oversight or
 service delivery. For these latter two dimensions, improving scores almost always requires the cooperation of, and contribution of
 information and effort from, more stakeholders with highly diverse interests and priorities. This suggests that a more labor-
 intensive and time-consuming process would be required to agree on action plans and arrangements for implementation. For
 example, setting up a well-functioning qualifications framework—one aspect of oversight in the SABER-WfD framework—calls for
 inputs from employers, curriculum experts, training providers, and skills assessors. It requires agreement on standards and
 procedures for the assessment and certification of skills acquisition.

 Looking forward, and based on international examples through time, TCc policymakers should bear in mind that no score
 stagnates, but raising a score to the next level of performance takes time and continued efforts. Based on a World Bank report

 on SABER studies across the world, we present below the evolution of scores in five select countries: Ireland, Singapore, Chile,
 South Korea, and Malaysia. The scores for strategy, oversight, and delivery all register improvements in the time frame for which
 data are available, often with gains sufficient to reach the next level of performance along the four-point scale (latent, emerging,
 established, and advanced). The workforce development systems of these countries benefitted from systemic improvements in the
 institutions responsible for shaping policies, as well as those responsible for governing the functioning of the system. These
 countries have taken a holistic approach to developing their workforce development systems and have sustained the effort over
 long periods. Singapore took nearly two decades to raise its score for strategy from established to advanced. Korea also took about
 two decades to raise its score for oversight from emerging to established, while Chile and Malaysia each took about a decade to
 raise their respective scores for delivery from emerging to established.

 Scores improve along diverse trajectories, reflecting the influence of specific conditions. That countries take different paths to
 build stronger workforce development systems is consistent with the intuition that country conditions constrain, as well as create
 space for, reform. Chile and Malaysia share similar gains in the scores for strategy and delivery, but Malaysia has made more
 progress in raising its score for oversight. One possible reason is that the country’s more centralized form of government facilitated
 rapid introduction, and successful implementation, of the Malaysia Qualifications Framework. Chile also initiated reforms to
 strengthen its qualifications framework, notably through the Chile Califica project; but given its more decentralized and market-
 driven form of government, it apparently needed more time to build consensus among employers for the creation and
 implementation of a single qualifications framework with wide scope and support. In other words, the Turkish Cypriot community’s
 workforce development system will improve following its own path, based on the specificities of the community’s economy, and
 no particular pattern of evolvement should be considered more or less appropriate.

Framework
In the SABER-WfD framework, workforce development
centers around three Policy Goals: (i) setting a strategic
direction for workforce development; (ii) fostering a
demand-led approach in workforce development; and
(iii) ensuring coordination among key sector leaders and
stakeholders. The ratings for these Policy Goals are
presented and explained below, followed by a reflection
on their implications for policy dialogue.

 the fund by paying 1% of payroll can then apply for grants and financial assistance (up to the amount of the levies paid) to retrain
 and upgrade the skills of their workforce. The HRDC specifies reimbursement rates depending on the type of training organized by
 firms and, generally, large firms are reimbursed at lower rates than smaller firms. In parallel to the HRDC, a Skills Development
 Fund was also established to provide individuals with loans to complete training courses in accredited institutions.
 During the early stages of HRDF implementation, only firms above 50 employees were covered, but by 1995 firms above 10
 employees became eligible for HRDF grants. As of 2008, there were over 10,000 firms/employers registered with the HRDF, and
 the revenues of the fund had increased from RM120 million in 2002 to over RM320 million in 2008. Similarly, disbursement of HDRF
 grants increased from RM160 million per year in 2002, to almost RM300 million in 2008, and the number of accredited training
 places almost doubled over the same period, from 420,000 in 2002 to almost 740,000 in 2008.
 An evaluation of the HRDF initiative carried out by Hong Tan using firm-level data found that the Fund resulted in an increase in
 enterprise training among all firms in the sample, with medium-sized ones benefitting the most from the scheme. At the same
 time, such increase in workers’ training resulted in productivity growth (particularly when the training was carried out on a
 continuous basis and done in parallel to investments in new technology). A further evaluation by Awang et al. (2010) found that
 training programs increased knowledge and skills, and improved positive work behavior; however, the impact on employees’ work
 performance and cognitive skills was limited. Similarly to other evaluations of comparable programs across the world, the impact
 of the HRDF was much smaller among small firms, probably due to their smaller budget for training, and their limited knowledge
 about how to train workers. The sectors with the highest take up rates of the scheme were professional services, scientific
 instruments, machinery and ceramics, while food, beverages, textiles, woods and furniture displayed the lower take up rates.
 Despite the uneven take-up across sectors and the relatively low compliance, Malaysia’s HRDF is generally considered successful,
 especially because of its transparency, its efficiency in reimbursing firms’ claims and the ease with which firms can apply for
 funding and grants. In the recent past, the Government of Malaysia introduced an e-disbursement system (that allows training
 grants to be credited directly into the accounts of selected employers), an e-levy payment system (that allows firms and employers
 to pay HDRF levies online), and a public star rating system that allows firms and workers to rate training providers and programs
 based on their quality and delivery. The most interesting aspect to the HRDF experience lies probably in the “clearing house” and
 information provider roles that the Malaysian Government took on, by pre-approving and accrediting training providers to reduce
 search costs for firm.

Box 4 - Strengthening coordination and clarifying roles of firms and the public sector in WfD
Both Ireland and Chile have successfully fostered coordination between businesses and governments for both strategy and service
delivery. This success is reflected in the advanced scores for strengthening strategic coordination and fostering relevance of training
programs for both countries in the most recent SABER WfD study year. Their experiences show that either party can lead in establishing
such coordination.
In Chile, mining companies under the leadership of the Chilean Mining Council and in collaboration with suppliers and contractors,
training providers, and the government, created a two-pronged sector strategy for TVET to ensure that it served their training needs
(Innovum Fundación Chile n.d.). The first component, a Mining Skills Council (CCM), was financed entirely by participating mining firms
and was created to modernize training in the sector and ensure its relevance through the development of a sectoral qualifications
framework, creation of training packages, accreditation of programs, and research to identify skills gaps. The second component, called
VetaMinera, sought to plug immediate skills gaps by serving in an intermediary role to provide information on occupations in mining
to students, maintain a database of graduates in the sector, and provide a coordinating function to promote the use of industry-
developed standards in training. Based on industry-provided information on training gaps, government funds (totaling almost two-
thirds of the total VetaMinera funding for the initial 2012–15 program duration) are made available to training providers on a
competitive basis to encourage delivery of programs to address industry-identified gaps.
In Ireland, the government created the Skillsnets Training Network Program to use the National Training Fund (sustained through a
levy of employee wages) to overcome coordination and financial barriers to firm-based training while increasing employer funds
devoted to workforce up-skilling and re-skilling. Firms with similar training needs, often in a related industry or region, self-select into
networks and apply for funding through Skillsnets. Network member companies are able to purchase any type of training delivered
through either classroom, on-the-job, or distance learning on a cost-matched basis using Skillsnet funds, while there are provisions for
non-network companies to participate at higher rates and limited state-subsidized places for unemployed individuals. The program
has enjoyed success since inception, currently sustaining 62 training networks with total government contributions of EUR 16 million.

Box 6 - Relevant, Effective, and Lifelong Training: The Role of Data and Monitoring in South Korea
In South Korea, to ensure that the skills taught to the current and future workforce are the right ones, the Ministry of Labor has
been conducting rigorous and periodical human resources- and training-needs surveys by region among businesses since 2005.
These surveys, aimed at providing authorities with the data necessary to plan training programs and make changes to course supply,
include an “establishment survey,” a “training-demand survey among the unemployed,” and a survey among institutions to assess
their ability to provide vocational training to the unemployed. In particular:
x The “establishment survey” is divided into two parts: One targets employees to be trained in-house, and one focuses on workers
     to be trained externally by the firm. These surveys capture both the skills that are likely to be demanded in the near future (i.e.
     the additional-skills requirement) from new workers, but also the type of marginal skills improvements that firms are interested
     in making among their existing workers. Combined, these surveys allow the government to forecast future demand for workers
     by skills level and occupational sector.
x The “training-demand survey among the unemployed” assesses the level of previous professional experience among the
     unemployed, future employment aspirations (as a dependent or self-employed worker), past training experiences (while
     unemployed), and future training needs.
x The survey among institutions that are training the unemployed aims to assess the ability of such centers to meet future demand
     for their services. Currently, more than 700 vocational institutions participate in the survey, with a focus on past training
     achievements, upcoming training plans, and student body.

Second, to ensure that training programs and institutions were still effective, a strict system of performance evaluations has been
set up. To instill some degree of competition among institutions, the evaluations were used to award excellence but, most
importantly, to punish poor performance. About 10% of all institutions evaluated have been shut down every year. The evaluation
process, which has been carried out for up to 1,500 institutes, includes the collection of information on training centers through
trainee-satisfaction surveys, an evaluation carried out by an inspector from Korea’s Human Resources Development Service, and an
evaluation carried out by an inspector of the Ministry of Labor.

Third, to ensure that training provision remained in line with market needs, the government decided to rely even more on the
private sector’s initiative and to adopt a less interventionist approach to skills development. The aim of the government was to
promote privately provided trainings at all levels and to foster “lifelong learning opportunities” for workers. As such, South Korea
further strengthened the incentives system after dropping mandatory training requirements for firms in the mid-1990s and replacing
them with a training levy/rebate system, in the early-2000s. Firms were still required to pay training levies as part of the employment
insurance scheme, with the requirement gradually extended to all firms, including small and medium-sized enterprises. The
categories of training expenses that qualified for a rebate of the levy were expanded significantly to include not only traditional
vocational-training programs, but also pre-service courses, on-the-job training, and skills upgrading, taught in both public and private
centers, internal to firms or externally provided.

Finally, in line with its new objective to provide lifelong learning opportunities to all workers, the Korean government put a large
emphasis on e-learning. E-learning courses are more convenient to attend and complete for older worker, because they provide
more flexibility in terms of time and location, and the government has recognized such courses as a legitimate training expense, one
for which firms could qualify for a levy rebate. The government’s support of e-learning activities paid off very rapidly. Between 1999
and 2006 alone, the share of e-learning training courses rose from less than 3 percent of total training provided in the country to
about 40 percent--a more than fifty-fold increase in absolute terms. The number of e-learning courses totaled less than 20,000 in
1999, and settled at more than one million in 2006. Whether e-learning trainings are as effective as class-based or plan-based
courses in terms of skills development remains to be seen, but surely it has boosted training accessibility in the country.
