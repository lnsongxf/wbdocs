AFGHANISTAN DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
May 2017
Preface


          The Afghanistan Development Update, which is published twice a year, provides a
          comprehensive report of the state of the Afghan economy. It covers recent economic
          developments and outlines the medium-term outlook for Afghanistan. Each edition
          includes a section that provides in-depth analysis on one or more specific focus topics.
          The lack of high-frequency data in Afghanistan makes it difficult to track economic
          activities on a monthly or quarterly basis. Thus, proxy indicators are utilized when
          their quality is deemed satisfactory. Efforts are made to ensure that key analysis and
          forecasts are based primarily on reliable sets of data.
          The Afghanistan Development Update is intended for a wide audience, including
          policy makers, the donor community, the private sector, the community of analysts
          and professionals engaged in monitoring the economy and Afghanistan’s citizens at
          large.
          This report was prepared by Omar Joya, Aman Farahi, Christina Wieser, and Claudia
          Nassif. The authors gratefully acknowledge the useful inputs provided by other
          members of the Afghanistan country team. Ehsanullah Nasiree assisted with the

  Executive summary

             In 2016, violent unrest continued to have a negative impact on the security of
             livelihoods in Afghanistan. The number of civilian casualties increased to
             unprecedented levels, with intensified internal conflict adding to the political
             uncertainty. Business sentiment remained suppressed, with the number of new firm
             registrations having continued to decline over the past four years. Real GDP growth
             increased from 1.1 percent in 2015 to 2.2 percent in 2016, mainly driven by strong
             growth in the agriculture sector. However, the non-agriculture sectors continued to
             exhibit sluggish growth. With Afghanistan’s population growth rate at nearly 3
             percent, an economic growth rate of 2.2 percent implies a decline in per capita
             income.
             The inflation rate increased from –1.5 percent in 2015 to 4.4 percent in 2016, driven
             by the lagged effects of currency depreciation and by a recovery in global food prices.
             As most consumer goods in Afghanistan are imported, global prices and exchange
             rate movements tend to have a significant impact on domestic prices.
             Revenue collection performance has improved significantly over the past two years,
             a reversal from the abrupt decline recorded in 2014. Domestic revenues increased by
             nearly 15 percent in 2016, exceeding the budget target by around 5 percent. However,
             in proportion to GDP, revenues still remain relatively low, at 10.5 percent.
             With an increase in exports and a decrease in imports (due to weaker domestic
             demand), the merchandise trade deficit is estimated to have improved from –36.6
             percent of GDP in 2015 to –33.3 percent in 2016. The large trade deficit continues
             to be financed by foreign aid, with a small surplus expected to be recorded in the
             current account balance in 2016, at around 4 percent of GDP.
             2016 also presented an increase in Afghanistan's humanitarian challenges. Over this
             year, more than 800,000 Afghan refugees returned from Pakistan and Iran.
             Displacements resulting from internal conflict have also sharply increased. With the
             likelihood of continued repatriation and internal displacement in 2017, this situation
             creates an urgent need for the Government to protect and provide basic services to
             these vulnerable individuals.
             In 2017, the economic growth rate is projected to increase modestly to 2.6 percent
             and is expected to gradually increase to around 3.6 percent by 2020. Stronger growth
             in out-years is predicated on improvements in security, the achievement of political
             stability, the successful implementation of reforms, and continued high levels of aid.
             Domestic revenues are projected to increase to 10.8 percent of GDP in 2017. While
             public spending is also projected to increase by a proportionate amount in relation to
             GDP, a nearly balanced fiscal budget may be achieved in 2017 if donor grants come
             in as planned.
             Over the medium term, the Government will continue to face significant fiscal
             challenges. Development and security expenditures are expected to increase, while
             resources are likely to remain tight. Thus, the strategic allocation of these resources
             and their efficient use is critically important.

             In this issue of the Update, the Focus Section discusses how economic stimulus can
             be provided in Afghanistan’s resource-constrained environment. In the context of the
             economic slowdown, Afghanistan faces the difficult dilemma of balancing measures
             to stimulate the economy while at the same time avoiding a further weakening of its
             fiscal position. The fiscal space is already extremely limited, with no room to increase
             public expenditure or to lower taxes. Thus, the Government must implement
             initiatives to maximize the growth impact of fiscal expenditure. First, policies to
             encourage government spending on non-tradable goods from local suppliers will
             ensure that demand taps domestic production, rather than imports. Second, policies
             to improve absorptive capacity will increase the quality, speed of execution and value
             for money of public investments. Third, policies to promote contestable markets in
             banking and construction will stimulate the entry of small and medium-sized firms in
             both sectors. Fourth, polices to increase fiscal space should include measures to
             improve revenue mobilization and to use existing resources more effectively, which
             will release additional resources.

  A. Recent Economic Developments

                     1. Background

The political and              The overall security environment continued to deteriorate in 2016. Taliban, ISIS and
security context               other armed groups have significantly intensified their attacks, with these groups
continues to affect            operating in a number of districts across Afghanistan. As a result, the number of
Afghanistan’s                  reported civilian casualties has also increased to record levels. Around 11,400 civilian
economic and social            casualties, including nearly 3,500 deaths and nearly 8,000 injuries, were reported to
outcomes                       have occurred in 2016. Increasing insecurity further compounds the fragile context in
                               which basic services and development initiatives are delivered and implemented.
                               The deteriorating security conditions and the increased repatriation of Afghans from
                               Europe, Iran and Pakistan have increased pressures related to internal displacement.
                               In 2016, over 800,000 Afghan refugees returned from Pakistan and Iran. An estimated
                               1.2 million Afghans remain in Pakistan, with a further 3 million in Iran, including
                               registered and unregistered refugees. A significant proportion of these individuals
                               could be subject to repatriation in 2017 if regional relations deteriorate. At the same
                               time, the number of displacements resulting from the internal conflict has increased
                               significantly due to the escalation of this conflict, with more than 640,000 people
                               being internally displaced in 2016. Thus, the total number of internally displaced
                               people currently stands at 1.4 million. Given that repatriation and internal
                               displacement are expected to continue in 2017, this situation creates an urgent need
                               for the Government to protect and provide basic services to these vulnerable
                               individuals.
                               In this difficult context, Afghanistan’s National Unity Government (“the
                               Government”) continued to pursue its ambitious reform agenda. On October 4, 2016,
                               the Government presented the new Afghanistan National Peace and Development
                               Framework (ANPDF) at the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan (BCA), which was
                               attended by representatives of around 70 countries and 30 international organizations.
                               At this conference, development aid of US$ 3.8 billion per year was pledged for the
                               next four years. In addition, at the NATO Warsaw Summit in July 2016, security
                               funding of US$ 4.5 billion per year was pledged for the same time period.

Economic recovery      With the withdrawal of international security forces starting in 2011 and with the

insecurity continues   declined significantly. Mean growth plummeted from an average annual rate of 9.4
to curtail private     percent in the period from 2003 to 2012 to 2.1 percent in the period from 2013 to
investment and         2016. In 2016, the growth rate increased to 2.2 percent,1 up from 1.1 percent2 in 2015,
consumer demand        principally due to the strong growth of the agriculture sector. The significant decline in
                       growth since 2012 reflects the        Figure 3: Real GDP growth, 2003-2016

                       2 billion in 2012 to more than

                         seaport, located in southeastern Iran on the Persian Gulf. This port will open a new
                         transit route for Afghanistan, having the potential to become the most important and
                         cost-efficient transit port for the country’s trade. While both the accession of
                         Afghanistan to the WTO and the opening of the Chabahar port could improve the
                         country’s investment prospects, the security environment will determine the extent to

                         over the year, opium production expanded significantly in all regions across the
                         country, increasing by around 43 percent in total, from around 3,300 metric tons in
                         2015 to an estimated 4,800 tons in 2016. This increase was due to the absence of
                         diseases that did not affect production this year, in contrast to previous years, when
                         such diseases had a significant impact.

                         urban areas did not change over this period, despite substantial migration flows from
                         rural to urban areas. Deteriorating living conditions in rural areas were mostly due to
                         the deteriorating security situation and the decline in international spending associated
                         with the withdrawal of international military forces. As a result, labor demand in the
                         off-farm sector declined, with most of the jobs created in the service sector during the
                         pre-transition phase being lost.

                             4.4 percent in 2016. Increases to both food- and non-food prices have contributed to
                             inflationary pressures. Food prices increased from –1.9 percent to 5.7 percent
                             between 2015 and 2016, while the increase in non-food prices was less steep, rising

                                recovered in the first half of 2016 (see Figure 7), domestic prices also started to rise,
                                increasing from 0.2 percent in December 2016 to 4.9 percent in June 2016. In the
                                second half of 2016, however, both world food prices and domestic inflation declined.
                                Thus, the inflation rate dropped from 5.9 percent in July 2016 to 4.5 percent in
                                December 2016.

                     3. External sector

Merchandise trade                The exports of goods increased by around 10 percent in 2016, with their total value
balance improved in              reaching US$ 614 million1 over the year. Exports of fruits, including fresh and dried
2016                             fruits, which together account for almost a third of exports, were the main driver of
                                 the growth in official exports. Improved horticultural performance has resulted in
                                 increases to fruit production over the past two years. While the level of fresh fruit
                                 exports depends on horticultural performance in the current year, the exports of
                                 dried fruits typically depends on the performance in the previous year, due to the
                                 time required for food processing (drying).

                                 On the other hand, the value of imports declined by 13.5 percent in 2016, down to
                                 US$ 6.6 billion. The decline since 2013 is likely due to weakened domestic demand
                                 and to the currency depreciation, which has increased the costs of imported goods.
                                 As a result, the merchandise trade balance (including estimated unofficial trade)
                                 improved, with the deficit shrinking from 36.6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 33.3
                                 percent in 2016.

Box 1. Afghanistan’s trade structure, across partner, has diversified in recent years
In the earlier decade, Afghanistan’s trade structure was highly concentrated around only a few trading
partners. Afghanistan’s largest trade partner, Pakistan, contributed to more than half (56.5 percent) of
Afghanistan’s trade, including both exports and imports. In terms of Afghanistan’s exported products, the
trade structure also remains highly concentrated, with the exports basket consisting of only a few products,
all of which are either agricultural products, or agriculture-related products, such as carpets and rugs.


                               1 The figure refers to “official” trade only. Unofficial exports, including smuggling, are not incorporated.

    A highly concentrated trade structure, in terms of products and/or partners, makes countries more
vulnerable to external trade shocks. Empirical studies show that countries with a less diversified trade
structure experience higher levels of growth volatility, and risk lower growth rates and higher levels of
inequality and poverty in the long-run.
     The trade structure in Afghanistan is now less
concentrated in terms of its trade partners than it was in the Figure 9: Trade partner concentration,

                               due to the lower net inflow of capital into the economy and to the increased tendency
                               for households to hold their savings in US dollars, which result in a decreased demand

reserves increased in           by around 8.5 percent in 2016. In December 2016, foreign exchange reserves stood
2016                            at US$ 7.3 billion, up from US$ 6.7 billion recorded in December 2015. The increase
                                in the reserves is mostly attributable to the decline in imports. The current level of
                                gross reserves is sufficient to cover around 11 months of imports.

percent increase                   9 percent, revenues have increased by about 41 percent. Both tax revenue (excluding
compared to 2015                   customs duty) and non-tax revenues contributed to the increased revenues in 2016. Tax
                                   revenue, which constitutes slightly less than half of total revenues, increased by nearly 17
                                   percent. Non-tax revenue, which constitutes less than a third of total revenues, increased
                                   by 25 percent. However, customs duties increased by only 3 percent over the year, due to
                                   the decrease in imports. Since 2011, the growth of customs duty has been lower than for
                                   any other source of revenue, increasing by only 2 percent in the period from 2011 to 2016.
                                   As a result, the contribution of customs duty to total revenues declined from 31 percent
                                   in 2011 to 22 percent in 2016.

levels                  During the 2014 fiscal crisis, Afghanistan’s revenues declined, arrears accumulated,
                        and spending cuts were enforced. Two years since, the Government has been able
                        to achieve a fiscal balance, with a small surplus, and to rebuild its cash reserves. This
                        has been largely due to improved revenue collection and to the regular disbursement
                        of on-budget donor grants, which increased by nearly 16 percent, to US$ 3.1 billion
                        in 2016. In the case of its discretionary budgets, namely the recurrent and
                        discretionary development budgets, the Government recorded a surplus of Af 11.8
                        billion (or 0.9 percent of GDP) in 2016, compared to the deficit of Af 19 billion (or
                        -1.7 percent of GDP) in 2014. The 2014 fiscal crisis led to a depletion of cash
                        reserves, which declined from an opening balance of Af 21 billion to a closing
                        balance of Af 8.7 billion over the course of the year. The improved management of
                        expenditure and increased discretionary resources (revenues and grants) in the past
                        two years enabled the Government to increase its cash reserves to around Af 21
                        billion by the end of 2016.

               5. Monetary and financial sector developments

Money demand has        The broad money (M2) growth rate, which includes currency-in-circulation and
increased, likely due   deposits in commercial banks, increased to 9.7 percent in December 2016 (year-on-
to higher prices        year), up from the figure of 3.1 percent recorded in the previous year. The year-on-
                        year currency-in-circulation growth rate also increased, from 4.1 percent to 10.3
                        percent, over the same period. The increase in money demand is probably the result
                        of increasing inflationary pressures. In December 2016, deposits in commercial banks
                        grew at an annualized rate of 10.3 percent. Although this is higher than the rate of 3.4
                        percent recorded in December 2015, it remains significantly lower than the rates
                        recorded in the years prior to 2013.

Commercial banks’       Commercial bank loans to the private sector remained flat at around Af 46 billion in
performance has         the period from December 2015 to December 2016. The absence of growth in private
been mixed              sector credit may indicate either a slowdown in private investments, banks’ weak
                        appetite for lending, or both. While the data shows an increase in lending in the first
                        half of 2016, this increase was primarily due to the effects of currency depreciation,
                        which inflated the value of assets held by commercial banks. Given the high degree
                        of dollarization in the Afghan economy, the shares of US denominated deposits and
                        loans are substantial, standing at 68 and 63 percent respectively. However, the quality
                        of banks’ assets improved in 2016. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs)
                        decreased from 12.1 percent in December 2015 to 10.8 percent in December 2016,
                        largely due to collateral repossessions. The banking sector remained profitable in

The financial sector           Commercial banks dominate the financial sector in Afghanistan. Other financial
remains                        services remain underdeveloped, contributing only modestly to financial
underdeveloped and             intermediation. While the banking sector’s assets amounted to 23 percent of GDP in
is characterized by            December 2016, the value of credit intermediated from banks to the private sector
low level of financial         stood at only 3.4 percent of GDP. The banking system remains highly liquid, with the
intermediation                 liquid assets ratio standing at more than 70 percent for the past two years, reflecting
                               the low level of intermediation. The Government has been intensifying its efforts to
                               develop and improve the oversight of the banking sector and to adopt prudential
                               measures to assess its soundness.

B. Outlook and Medium-Term Prospects
Growth is projected     The economic growth rate is projected to accelerate modestly to 2.6 percent in 2017.
to increase to 2.6      While this shows a slight acceleration since 2014, it is still significantly lower than the
percent in 2017         average growth rate recorded in the period from 2003 to 2012, which stood at 9.6
                        percent. The weaker domestic demand and subdued investment sentiment caused by
                        the increased violence and political uncertainty have resulted in lower growth since
                        2014. Industry and services are expected to grow by 2.5 and 2.4 percent respectively
                        in 2017, while agricultural output is projected to grow by 1.5 percent.

WTO accession and       Afghanistan’s accession to the World Trade Organization, the opening of the
infrastructure          Chabahar port in Iran (with this port serving as an alternative, low-cost transit route),
projects could          the initiation of the Trans-Hindukush road connectivity project, and a number of
significantly improve   other national and regional projects could significantly improve Afghanistan’s
prospects for private   prospects for private investment and business activities. In addition, a number of
investment and          important Government reforms in the areas of anti-corruption, revenue collection,
business activities     and private sector development could help build confidence in the economy in the
                        longer term, although their impact in the short term is likely to be limited. However,
                        unless security challenges and political uncertainty are addressed, these reforms will
                        bear little impact on growth.

Growth is expected      The growth rate is expected to gradually increase to around 3.6 percent by 2020.
to gradually increase   Stronger growth in out-years is predicated on the achievement of improvements in
over the medium-        security, political stability, a successful reform progress, and continued high levels of
term                    aid. The poverty rate is expected to remain high due to weak labor demand and
                        security-related constraints on service delivery, despite some positive offsetting
                        impacts from improvements to the performance of the agriculture sector and lower
                        food prices.

A balanced budget is Domestic revenues are projected to increase only marginally in proportion to GDP,
expected in 2017     increasing from 10.5 percent of GDP in 2016 to 10.8 percent in 2017. While this
                     represents a growth of nearly 12 percent in nominal terms, these increases are much
                     lower than those achieved in 2015 and 2016. Expenditures, too, are expected to
                     increase. Total expenditure is expected to increase to around 27 percent of GDP in
                     2017, up from 25.6 percent in the previous year, driven by higher recurrent security
                     spending and higher development expenditure. With donor grants budgeted at 16.8
                     percent of GDP, the overall fiscal balance will be in a minor surplus of about 0.4
                     percent of GDP.

Over the medium         Over the medium term, fiscal outcomes are highly sensitive to the level and modality
term, fiscal outcomes   of aid commitments. Total budget expenditures are projected to increase from 25.6
are highly sensitive    percent of GDP in 2016 to 30.1 percent in 2020. This increase largely reflects the fact
to the level and        that security spending previously undertaken directly by international partners is being

commitments.            current service levels to an increasingly large population and the expenditure on
                        essential infrastructure and the essential maintenance of aid-financed assets recently
                        transferred to the Government. If the Government can sustain recent improvements
                        to compliance and administration, domestic revenues are projected to increase to 12
                        percent of GDP by 2020, although these domestic revenues will still only cover

                               around 40 percent of budgeted expenditures. Thus, Afghanistan will need on-budget
                               civilian aid to a value of about 18 percent of GDP to fund basic social services and
                               development programs over the coming years. Given that part of the increase in
                               public spending is due to the on-budgeting of expenditures that have been funded
                               off-budget, a proportional amount in donor grants should also be delivered on-
                               budget. However, any shortfall in the on-budget delivery of donor grants will
                               exacerbate fiscal pressures and put Afghanistan in an extremely difficult position.

Prices are expected     In 2017, the inflation rate is expected to increase to around 6 percent, with this
to remain stable and    increase driven by the lagging effect of currency depreciation, which persisted
the current account     throughout the first half of 2016. Despite the increase, at this rate, inflation remains
to remain in surplus.   within the Da Afghanistan Bank’s target range. The current account balance is
                        expected to remain in a surplus equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP as a result of the
                        continued influx of foreign aid. With a projected increase in both exports and
                        imports, the merchandise trade deficit is expected to remain at around 33 percent of

                        import bill. Even with optimal revenue policies and administrative settings,
                        Afghanistan’s upper-bound revenue potential stands at only around 17 percent of
                        GDP, due to the undiversified economy and the continued heavy dependence on
                        subsistence agriculture. At this level, this revenue is well short of projected
                        expenditure needs. Given low levels of human capital, substantial infrastructure

C. Focus Section I: How to provide economic stimulus
in a resource-constrained environment
Afghanistan faces dire prospects in its struggle to achieve fiscal sustainability. The long-term fiscal outlook is
discouraging, with current analysis by the World Bank showing that Afghanistan will not be able to meet its
public spending needs without substantial donor funding for the foreseeable future, even in the best-case
scenarios for economic growth. As discussed in the previous Afghanistan Development Update (October
2016), total expenditures are projected to reach a value of at least twice that of projected domestic revenues by
2030, with the potential for domestic borrowing and external concessional borrowing continuing to be limited.
Even in a high-growth scenario involving the development of the extractives sector; the generation of natural
resource rents; a reduction in security costs as a result of improvements to the security situation; and the
implementation of critical reforms to provide cost savings, domestic revenues are forecast to reach only 19
percent of GDP. Even in this scenario, the financing gap (after borrowing) would still only decline to around
12 percent of GDP by 2030 (see Figure 16).

       Afghanistan also faces the challenge of managing a significant economic slowdown. The withdrawal of
international security forces commenced in 2011, with the subsequent security and political transition occurring
in 2014. Since then, the average economic growth rate has declined from 9.4 percent in the period from 2003
to 2012 to around 2.1 percent in the period from 2013 to 2016. With business and consumer confidence
suffering due to the deterioration in the security and political environment, domestic demand weakened, leading
to a deceleration in real GDP growth and an increase in unemployment.
       In this context, the typical fiscal policy response would be to implement measures to stimulate the
economy by increasing domestic demand, either by increasing public expenditure (or transfers) or reducing
taxes. However, deficit financing is not an available option. Given the limited fiscal space and the extraordinary
pressure on fiscal sustainability in Afghanistan, economic stimulus measures will be practically impossible to
implement. Thus, the dilemma that Afghanistan (and many other low-income countries) faces relates to the

need to provide economic stimulus in an environment where resources are extremely limited and/or the current
fiscal trajectory is not sustainable. Obviously, in this situation, increasing the overall level of spending is
impossible. Nevertheless, even in these circumstances, the Government could reshuffle the composition of public
spending to achieve a similar set of objectives, by:
       (i) prioritizing resources for the most important spending needs;
       (ii) increasing the impact of public expenditure by investing resources in sectors where they can have
             maximum impact; and
       (iii) improving the efficiency of public expenditure to achieve cost-savings.

       In order to make informed decisions regarding the prioritization of public expenditure and/or
maximizing the impact of this expenditure, assessment of the fiscal multipliers for the functional categories1
of public spending may be a useful analytical tool. A determination of the magnitude of the fiscal multiplier for
each functional category of expenditure will assist the Government to better understand the sectors in which
the growth impact of public expenditure will be highest. The Government can take this information into
account when prioritizing expenditure and/or when preparing a fiscal consolidation plan for the medium-term
in the context of its financing constraints.

What is a fiscal multiplier?
The Government spending multiplier quantifies how strongly output or components of aggregate private
activity increase when the Government temporarily increases its purchases or transfers. An extra dollar spent
on goods and services can generate more than one dollar’s worth of additional activity, as a portion of the
expenditure will be re-spent by those who benefited from the original outlay. The key element is that households
respond to having additional disposable income by spending at least a part of it on additional consumption.
The fraction of an additional dollar of disposable income that is spent on additional consumption is called the
“marginal propensity to consume.” In economics, the term “marginal” refers to the response to an incremental
change.

        When an economy is faced with decelerating growth, increases in public expenditure can play a role in
filling the gap caused by reduced outlays by businesses and households. These expenditures, if appropriately
timed and focused, and of the appropriate magnitude, can stimulate demand and economic activity and thereby
reduce the likelihood and extent of job losses, thus facilitating economic recovery.
       When an economy is on an unsustainable fiscal path, a fiscal consolidation or adjustment may be
required. Fiscal adjustments can be achieved either through reductions in spending across the board or in
specific sectors. Fiscal adjustments can also be achieved by reallocating spending to one or another sector; by
increasing taxes; or by some combination of spending and taxation adjustments. Fiscal adjustments are only
appropriate if they have the lowest possible negative impact on economic growth; if they prioritize growing
spending needs; and if they ensure that scarce resources are spent efficiently. Of course, fiscal adjustments may
be justified if these adjustments promote growth or, at the very least, if they do not lead to a net decline in
aggregate demand. Therefore, making informed decisions related to the size, timing and nature of the fiscal
adjustment requires precise estimates of the functional fiscal multiplier, which determines the response of output to
changes in the functional components of public spending.

The size of the multiplier in low-income countries
The estimates for the magnitude of fiscal multipliers vary considerably from one country to another: it is
increasingly clear that there is no single immutable multiplier. Rather, the magnitude of the multiplier is
determined by a range of factors, including the structure of the underlying economy, the nature and the duration
of the fiscal change (expansion or consolidation), the composition of the fiscal change (level of expenditures
and/or revenues change), the level of public debt, the propensity to consume and import, other monetary and
financial conditions, the exchange rate, and the type of the econometric model used in the study.
      In low-income countries, estimates for the magnitude of fiscal multipliers range from 0.25 to 0.70 in the
short term, and cumulatively from 0.5 to 0.9 over the medium term. Studies also show that fiscal multipliers
are much weaker in countries that have high levels of debt, low average incomes, flexible exchange rates, and
higher levels of international openness.

Functional fiscal multipliers in Afghanistan
Afghanistan’s economy has many features that greatly complicate attempts to estimate the magnitude of the
Government spending multiplier. The Afghan economy is a complex mix of formal/informal activities, with
illicit crops, war-driven spending, and aid-sustained enclaves. This situation is the result of more than 30 years
of protracted conflict that has resulted in Figure 18: Size of fiscal multiplier in selected countries

0.78, meaning that a 1-percentage point of GDP increase in public spending leads to a 0.78 percent increase in
output, all other things being equal. Compared to a range of other low-income countries (see Figure 18), the
fiscal multiplier in Afghanistan is apparently the highest, with the average multiplier for the group standing at
0.69. One possible explanation for Afghanistan’s relatively high fiscal multiplier is the large share of security
spending, which has a positive multiplier effect (see Figure 19). Security spending in Afghanistan is exceptionally
high, with one of the highest proportions relative to GDP in the world.

       Education (1.48), followed by
health (1.20), are the two next largest multipliers. Taken together with the multiplier on social protection, the
size of these estimators demonstrates the significant positive impact that social protection programs (such as
through cash transfers) can have on output and poverty reduction. This result conforms with the findings of a
number of theoretical studies that demonstrate that well-targeted transfers can have an expansionary effect on
output. Analysis of cash transfer programs in a number of countries has also found that cash transfers result in
increased investment in household economic activities and increased social capital. They also enable
beneficiaries to re-enter existing social networks, and/or to strengthen informal safety nets and risk-sharing
arrangements.
       The key message is that investments in health and education and cash transfer programs generate both
short and long-term economic benefits through improvements to human capital. In turn, this leads to an
increase in labor productivity and employability. However, the large size of the multipliers suggest that cash
transfer programs also influence the productive dimension of beneficiary households.
       Unsurprisingly, spending on defense has a positive multiplier effect (0.71) on real GDP growth in
Afghanistan, as is the case in many other countries. Given the size of the Afghan army, military spending
eventually increases household income through wages and through the local procurement of goods and
services.
       Finally, the multiplier for expenditure on economic affairs, which include expenditures on infrastructure,
energy and agriculture, is negative (-1.11). The key determinant for the growth effects of public spending on
infrastructure is the degree of efficiency of the expenditure, which can be determined by the extent to which it
results in the production of service-yielding assets. However, the evidence shows that the link between
expenditure on infrastructure and the production of services/assets is weak, particularly in the case of
developing countries. Two factors could account for low efficiency. First, weak technical capacity leads to poor
project selection, cost overruns and implementation delays, and poor project management. All these factors are

more significant in the case of expenditure on infrastructure than in the case of other types of expenditures.
Second, poor fiscal governance, poor procurement practices, political favoritism, and corruption substantially
affect the efficiency of public infrastructure expenditures. Both these factors have an impact in the case of
Afghanistan, as they do in many other developing countries. Corruption, which is a particular concern in
Afghanistan, drastically increases the unit cost of infrastructure projects, which in turn translates into poor value
for money and poor quality of assets/services.
       The import content in the case of infrastructure spending in Afghanistan is also high. Almost all inputs
and materials for infrastructure projects are imported. This means that all financial resources expended on
infrastructure translate into an increase in imports, which in turn may more than offset any potential positive
effects on domestic demand. Thus, it is not surprising to see that the multiplier effect in the case of expenditure
on economic affairs, most of which consists of expenditure on infrastructure, is negative in Afghanistan.
       It should be noted that fiscal multipliers are time-variant. When public spending changes dramatically,
the multipliers are unlikely to remain constant. For instance, if defense spending increases following a
deterioration in the security environment, the multiplier effect could be much higher.

What can be done to maximize the multiplier?
We now return to the fundamental question: How is the Government to provide economic stimulus in a resource constrained
environment? This question can be broken down into two parts. The first part relates to measures to maximize
economic stimulus, which relates to the empirical question of the magnitude of the multiplier effect in
Afghanistan. The second part of the question relates to measures that could be taken to relax the resource
constraint.

    1. Increasing the size of the multiplier
Generally, the size of the spending multiplier is dependent on factors such as:
    The extent of underutilized capacity in an economy (the multiplier effect will be smaller the closer an
        economy is to full capacity);
    People’s and businesses’ marginal propensity to save out of increased income (the higher the
        proportion of income that is re-spent, the greater the multiplier effect);
    The import content of people and business’ spending (funds used to pay for imported goods achieve
        a once-only local stimulus); and
    How quickly the money is spent (projects that require lots of planning before most spending occurs
        will not provide much stimulus when most needed).
      The World Bank study found that, in practice, two characteristics of low-income countries are likely to
mediate the effect of government spending on real GDP growth, these being: (i) absorptive capacity; and (ii)
market contestability, particularly in the construction and banking sectors. The study commissioned by the
World Bank found that a one standard deviation change in absorptive capacity yields an 18 percent larger
multiplier effect compared to the average level of absorptive capacity. Similarly, a one standard deviation change
in contestability yields a 14 percent larger multiplier effect.
       Absorptive capacity is the ability of the Government to identify, attract and efficiently use financial
resources (domestic and external). Key to this concept is the extent to which modern management practices
and skilled manpower are present in the public sector. The lack of these skills can severely limit the volume of
productive investments that can be planned, organized and executed. Absorptive capacity is thus conceptualized
as the Government’s latent ability to marshal, develop, direct, and control its human, physical and information
capital to support the discharge of its policy directions.
      Governments with a high absorptive capacity are characterized by a combination of strong policy
formulation capacities and by the presence of skilled technocrats. These characteristics enable these
governments to be adaptable, effective and efficient in their endeavors to utilize financial resources to produce

                                                                                                                    20

tangible public investments. By contrast, governments with a low absorptive capacity are unable to utilize
financial resources to produce tangible public investments efficiently and effectively.
       Market contestability is another important factor. In low-income countries, the conditions for perfect
competition are often unfulfilled. Thus, these countries do not always reap the potential benefits of competition,
such as lower prices, better quality goods, job creation and faster economic growth. At the same time, efforts
to deregulate markets do not always benefit consumers. For example, the experience of many low-income
countries shows that in the absence of rules to manage competition and of a supporting institutional
infrastructure, consumer welfare does not always benefit from trade and investment liberalization and
privatization.
       Recent developments in Afghanistan underscore this predicament. According to the Asia Foundation’s
Survey of the Afghan People, the public increasingly links the worsening economy with the Government’s
policies on free markets and/or with its inability to perform. While the National Unity Government has
prioritized the achievement of economic growth in its policy reform agenda, popular expectations regarding
the putative impact of a free market economy have yet to be matched by the creation of a significant number
of productive jobs and by the delivery of high quality goods at low prices. Further, a survey by the American
University of Afghanistan in October 2016 found that 78 percent of the respondents believed that the private
sector has failed to deliver jobs, and that privatization and free trade has killed small local businesses while
protecting larger, politically important businesses.
       Contestability is absent in Afghanistan. According to the Doing Business indicators, Afghanistan ranks
in 177th place in terms of regulatory quality and efficiency for investment, with no improvements during 2015.
The number of new firm registrations in 2016 remains well below that recorded in 2012/13, illustrating the
difficulty of launching new businesses in the country.
       In Afghanistan, the construction industry could play a critical role in the transformation of the
Government’s financial resources into tangible public investments. The construction industry delivers the
roads, rails, bridges, dams, airports and housing that are the critical components of the infrastructure required
to support a modern economy. In addition to delivering critical infrastructure, the construction industry plays
its role by creating jobs at scale, because the industry is labor intensive. However, if the construction is not
contestable but rather dominated by a few large international firms, with small local firms excluded, then the
impact of government spending will be muted at the national level and totally absent in local economies.
       The same is true of the banking sector. Competition in the banking industry matters for a number of
reasons. As in other industries, the degree of competition in banking matters for the efficiency of the production
of financial services, the quality of financial products and the degree of innovation in the sector.
       Banking markets are already moving towards a higher level of contestability. Digital technology has had
the effect of lowering entry barriers into some sub-markets in the banking industry, with services such as mobile
money payments and cross-border transfers. Modern digital technology has lowered the marginal cost of
transactions, it has made distance and location increasingly less significant, it has lowered consumer search
costs, it has increased the availability of information, and it has lowered the cost of price discovery. A
contestable banking sector has the potential to better serve the needs of low-income economies.
       However, some caution is required in the promotion of contestability in financial markets. Many of the
relationships and tradeoffs between competition, financial system performance, access to financing, stability,
and finally growth, are complex from a theoretical perspective. Also, empirical evidence related to competition
in the financial sector is scarce and, to the extent that it is available, produces unclear conclusions. However,
both theory and empirics indicate that with these tradeoffs, it is not sufficient to analyze competitiveness on
the basis of a narrow concept or to focus on one effect only.
       Rather, it is necessary to consider competition in the context of a broad set of objectives, including the
efficiency of the financial sector, access to financial services for various segments of users, and systemic financial
sector stability, and to consider possible tradeoffs between these objectives. And since competition depends on

several factors, it is necessary to consider a broad set of policy tools in endeavors to increase competition in
this sector.

    (i) Increase absorptive capacity
      Policies to increase absorptive capacity will help to strengthen the productivity of public investment and
to enable high growth returns from investment projects, thus maximizing the spending multiplier. As discussed
above, the concept of absorptive capacity refers to the sum total of individual actions of government employees
operating within various practical and political constraints, which are in large part set by the policies and
resources provided to the agency or ministry by elected officials. Initiatives to increase absorptive capacity
should therefore be two-pronged, including both initiatives that target individual government employees and
those that target government-wide policies.
     Polices to increase the absorptive capacity of Afghanistan public sector agencies include:
     Providing skilled civil servants with merit pay and bonuses;
     Allowing skilled civil servants greater input into policy formulation and implementation processes;
     Allowing agencies greater flexibility to respond to best practice and project peculiarities;
     Providing better, more relevant and more rigorous training to deliver stronger medium-term budget
      frameworks;
     Improving public investment management by streamlining the project appraisal process and budgeting
      cycle;
     Providing better, more relevant and more rigorous training to enable bureaucrats to deliver more
      thorough appraisal and selection of investment projects;
     Providing better, more relevant and more rigorous training to enable bureaucrats to monitor and
      deliver high quality systematic ex-post evaluations;

    (ii) Improve contestability in construction and banking sectors
      As discussed previously, promoting contestable markets in the construction and banking sector is
important if government spending is to have a significant positive impact on economic outcomes. Policies to
ensure that markets are contestable will play a role in strengthening the private sector response to increased
government spending, thus maximizing the size of the spending multiplier effect. Such policies include both
those targeting competition policy and those targeting procurement policy. Thus, they should include:
       Improving and strengthening the competition law, and empowering the national competition authority
        with a clear mandate;
       Simplifying legal procedures and providing working capital grants to facilitate the entry of new small
        and medium-sized construction firms that will create jobs;
       Simplifying legal procedures to facilitate start-ups and entry in the financial sector.
      These policy reforms are aimed at ensuring that markets function better, delivering lower prices, enabling
the entry of small- and medium-size firms, and creating jobs. The reforms aim to ensure that public funds are
used in the most efficient manner possible, with greater transparency, probity and accountability. This will
ensure that the system delivers value for money. Further, studies on the effect of reforming procurement
processes provide evidence that competitive and transparent procurement processes play a role in enabling
public authorities to acquire better quality goods and services at lower costs. It is essential to include provisions
to promote transparency to ensure that the opening up of procurement is effective.

    2. Relaxing the resource constraint
This report now returns to the second part of question posed at the beginning of this section: How is the
Government to provide economic stimulus in a resource-constrained environment?

May 20 17                                                                                THE WOR LD B A NK

      One means to overcome the constraints of a resource-constrained environment is to increase the fiscal
space. It is useful to think of fiscal space as having three components: government revenues, internal financial
resources (domestic borrowing), and external resources (grants, external borrowing). Also included are the
domestic resources that would become available as a result of more effective public expenditure.
        The following policy measures can increase the internal finance resources of a low-income country:
        Extending the range of financial services (creation of ‘basic’ bank accounts suitable for poor
         households);
        Increasing contestability in the banking industry with a view to improving financial products in order
         to retain the savings of high-income households and to facilitate transfers from migrant workers;
        Facilitating the introduction of electronic payment systems such as mobile money systems to bank the
         unbanked and to deepen financial coverage;
        Improving the financial literacy of the poorest households;
        Strengthening the regulation of the financial system (to ensure that regulations are respected, to
         introduce transparency in rules by which loans are granted, and so on) in order to develop a climate of
         trust in the formal banking system.
     The following policy measures will play a role in channeling financial savings to enable the mobilization
of domestic resources, which can then be utilized to finance government spending:
     Introducing a vibrant Sukuk public bond market (improvement in issuance procedures, standardization
       of bonds, training of specialist intermediaries);
     Devolving budget responsibility to local authorities (channeling savings into the public sector, as supply
       of public services would be closer to local communities);
     Improving budget practices in order to increase the public’s trust in the Government.

Conclusion
In the context of the economic slowdown, Afghanistan faces the difficult task of balancing measures to
stimulate the economy while at the same time avoiding a further weakening of its fiscal sustainability. Fiscal
space is already extremely limited, with little room to increased public expenditure or to lower taxes. In this
context, the Government must implement initiatives to maximize the growth impact of fiscal expenditure. First,
policies to encourage government spending on non-tradable goods from local suppliers will ensure that demand
stimulates domestic production, rather than imports. Favoring local suppliers in procurement processes will
not raise domestic prices or reduce welfare if markets are competitive and contestable. Second, policies to
improve absorptive capacity will increase the quality, speed of execution and value for money of public
investments. Third, policies to promote contestable markets in banking and construction will stimulate the
entry of small and medium-sized firms in both sectors. In the banking sector, the new firms will strengthen
financial markets by introducing innovative financial products. In the construction sector, the new firms will
play a role in the creation of jobs in this labor-intensive sector. Fourth, polices to increase fiscal space should
include measures to better mobilize domestic resources and to use existing resources more effectively, which
will release additional resources.

D. Focus Section II: Movement patterns of returns
and internal displacement in 2016: An analysis based
on a variety of data sources

    There is currently no system by which migration flows and, in particular, displacement can be tracked in a
    timely manner. This poses a significant challenge to the design and targeting of humanitarian and
    development interventions in the context of recurring episodes of forced displacement. Information
    regarding undocumented returns, documented returns,1 and internal displacement are collected by three
    different humanitarian agencies (IOM, UNHCR, and UN-OCHA) at the border, encashment centers, or at
    the place of displacement respectively. While these systems compile data related to the numbers of returnees
    and internally displaced, there is a lack of accurate information on: (i) the actual destination of return (as
    opposed to the intent of return); (ii) community-level pressures (in terms of hosting displaced populations);
    (iii) and community needs, in order to support the targeting and/or redirection of humanitarian assistance,
    and the design and implementation of appropriate development interventions. Monitoring returns has not
    been systematic and existing efforts have not proven easy.
    Data sources
    The starting point for assessing the spatial distribution of internally displaced people and returns in 2016 is
    based on information collected by IOM, UNHCR, and OCHA. The databases of these agencies provide the
    most accurate available data related to the size of each of these groups (reference year: January to December
    2016). This combined database suggests that the 1.5 million individuals fall into one of three categories: (i)
    undocumented returnees (31 percent of all displaced people in Afghanistan); (ii) documented returnees (25
    percent); and (iii) internally displaced (44 percent).
          Even though data related to the numbers of returns are readily available from IOM and UNHCR, the
    database contains information on the intended place of return and not the actual place of return. To better
    understand the spatial distribution of displaced populations, it is essential to complement and verify these
    numbers with other data sources. However, other data sources are not readily available and, where they exist,
    cover the country only partially. For example, the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG)
    collected information for 31 out of 34 provinces.2 The IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM)
    compiled by the IOM to track and monitor population displacement during crises includes information for
    Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman only.3
    What we currently know
    Total displacement
    The recent Return Monitoring Update by UNHCR, which was based on interviews conducted to track
    returnees over time, does not fully represent the documented returnee population. It also suggests that there
    are meaningful differences between the intended destinations and the actual destinations of returnees.4



1 Documented returnees are issued a proof of registration (PoR) card by the UNHCR in neighboring countries, while undocumented
  returnees do not have a PoR.
2 IDLG data collection was collected as a one-time effort rather than a recurring or regular data collection process.
3 IOM plans to expand the DTM into an additional 6 provinces (Baghlan, Balkh, Kabul, Kunduz, Paktya, and Takhar) in the next
  months.

       To better gauge the reliability of data collected by humanitarian agencies, the data can be triangulated
 with the IDLG province-level data and the IOM-DTM. IDLG’s province-level data provides estimates of
 IDPs and returnees for 31 of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, excluding Balkh, Hirat and Panjsher. These
 31 provinces account for 96 percent of the population of interest in the humanitarian database. It can be
 observed that the total number of displaced people is strikingly similar, with a total of 1.4 million displaced
 people (returnees and IDPs) in the humanitarian and IDLG sources (see Figure 20). However, as discussed
 in more detail below, the distribution of returns and IDPs in proportion to the population of interest is
 different. There are at least a couple of explanations for this apparent discrepancy: (i) it is difficult to

     This distribution of the IDLG province-level data suggests that the top seven provinces of concern, in
descending order, are Kunduz (dominated by IDPs), Nangarhar (majority returns), Kabul (majority returns),
Takhar, Faryab, Urozgan, and Helmand. Taken together, these account for more than 70 percent of the total
number of displaced people according to these provincial estimates.
Returnees
Data on returnees from IOM and UNHCR (documented and undocumented) show that the intended
destination of returnees is concentrated towards the East of Afghanistan. About 50 percent of all returnees
intend to return to Nangarhar, 13 percent to Kabul, 6 percent Laghman, and 5 percent to Kunar (see Map
2). Within provinces, returnees show a preference for urban and peri-urban areas as their intended destination
and often intend to move to district centers or adjacent districts.

      The data compiled by the humanitarian agencies (IOM, UNHCR, and UNOCHA) show a strikingly
similar number of displaced people. However, the distribution of returnees in proportion to the population
of interest is different according to the IDLG province-level database (see Figure 20). According to the IDLG
province-level data, 35 percent of the total number of displaced are returnees (less than 500,000), compared
to the figure of 58 percent according to the humanitarian agencies (over 820,000 returnees). This distribution
of IDLG province-level data suggests that the top six provinces of concern, in descending order, are
Nangarhar, Kabul, Helmand, Baghlan, Laghman, and Kunduz, four of which (Nangarhar, Kabul, Baghland,

    and UNHCR’s intent of return report 415,222 returnees.
    Internally displaced persons (IDPs)
    According to data from humanitarian sources, the geographic profile for internal displacement is more
    dispersed and follows different patterns than for returnees. According to data from UN-OCHA, there are
    IDPs in all 34 provinces and in about one third of all districts in Afghanistan. However, the bulk of the IDP
    population is located in the South and North of Afghanistan (see Map 3). IDPs tend to move within the
    province, with the majority of IDPs settling in provincial centers. Takhar province hosts the largest number
    of IDPs (85,000), followed by Hilmand (69,000), Kunduz (63,000), Uruzgan (57,000), Farah (51,000), and
    Kandahar (51,000). Internally displaced persons tend to move to the nearest secure area, where they have
    some form of social network, typically in the provincial or district center. The figure for within-province
    displacement stands at more than 90 percent in half of all provinces, while the figure for within-district
    displacement stands at more than 90 percent in one third of the districts.6 IDPs tend to settle in the provincial
    centers. In the case of all of the top six provinces, the provincial center district is the primary destination for
    displaced people.

          Data from the IDLG province-level database show that the distribution of IDPs in proportion to the
    population of interest varies from that according to humanitarian sources. According to IDLG province-level

    humanitarian agencies. IDLG province-level data shows almost 920,000 IDPs while the humanitarian

database contains 606,000 records. As mentioned above, these discrepancies could stem from: (i) the difficulty
of distinguishing between returns and IDPs in the field through administrative channels; (ii) information at
the district level may be quite different from that at the provincial level; (iii) some returnees may have been
displaced subsequent to entering Afghanistan.

      When comparing results from the humanitarian database with those from the IOM’s DTM, significant
differences in the number of IDPs can be observed. These variations
need to be further investigated. For example, according to the DTM, the Province   OCHA #     DTM #

APPENDIX I: WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN
1. The World Bank Group’s program in Afghanistan is guided by the Country Partnership Framework (CPF)
   for FY 2017–FY 2020, which focuses on three strategic areas: (i) build strong and accountable institutions
   to support the Government’s state-building objectives, enable the state to fulfil its core mandate to deliver
   basic services to its citizens, and create an enabling environment for the private sector; (ii) support inclusive
   growth, with a focus on lagging areas and urban informal settlements; and (iii) deepen social inclusion
   through improved human development outcomes and reduced vulnerability amongst the poorest sections
   of society, including the large numbers of internally displaced persons and returnees.
2. Since April 2002, the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) has committed over
   $3.46 billion for development and emergency reconstruction projects, and five budget support operations
   in Afghanistan. This support comprises over $3.02 billion in grants and $436.4 million in no-interest loans
   known as ‘credits’. The Bank has 15 active IDA projects in Afghanistan with net commitment value of
   over $1.1 billion. In addition, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) has generated US$ 9.2
   billion of funding from 34 donors, and committed US$ 4.2 billion for the Government’s recurrent costs
   and US$ 4.45 billion for government investment programs. As of May 2017, the active IDA portfolio was
   worth US$ 1.06 billion and the active ARTF investment portfolio was worth US$ 3.3 billion
3. The Bank also administers the ARTF, the World Bank Group’s largest single-country multi-donor trust
   fund. The ARTF provides grant support to Afghanistan based on a three-year rolling financing strategy.
   Together, the IDA and the ARTF provide close to US$ 1 billion per year in grant resources (about US$
   200 million from IDA and about US$ 800–US$ 900 million from the ARTF). The ARTF is a key vehicle
   for providing the Government with predictable and transparent on-budget financing, providing a platform
   for policy dialogue between the Government and donors.
4. Since September 2016, the World Bank Board has approved the Citizens’ Charter Afghanistan Project to
   the amount of US$ 300 million, as well as an additional financing to an existing project, the Financial Sector
   Rapid Response Project, to the amount of US$ 20 million. Under the ARTF, Citizens’ Charter project was
   approved by the ARTF Management Committee (MC) in the amount of US$ 300 million, which is jointly
   financed by the ARTF and IDA. Besides this, a number of project preparation grants (PPGs) were
   approved since September 2016 to lay the necessary ground work. The approved PPGs include: US$ 2
   million for Urban National Priority Program; US$ 5 million for the Afghanistan International Labor
   Mobility and Domestic Labor Market Insertion Project; US$ 7.3 million for the Afghanistan Extractives
   for Development project. Additional Financing for existing projects include US$ 4.7 million for the
   Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Project.
5. The World Bank continues to engage in rigorous analytical work and to place a significant emphasis on
   policy dialogue. These non-lending activities have supported the World Bank’s lending program and played
   a crucial role in informing the Government of its strategic choices and in advancing dialogue between the
   Government and its international development partners. In the last fiscal year, the ARTF Steering
   Committee endorsed the Research and Analysis Program (RAP), which aims to support the Government
   policy reform agenda and decision-making processes. The program creates an opportunity to introduce
   innovative ways of working with the Government, universities and local research institutions to introduce
   analysis and generate knowledge. As part of the RAP, the World Bank is currently engaged in a series of
   analytical works to enhance understanding of Afghanistan’s growth and fragility challenges and to inform
   the development response of the Government and international development partners. The initial results
   of this work were presented at the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan in October 2016.
6. IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Afghanistan has more than doubled between FY08 and FY14 –
   from around $58 million to about $135 million in FY14 – but this strong growth could not be maintained
   due to a worsening of security, political uncertainty, and operating conditions. At present, IFC’s committed
   investment portfolio in Afghanistan stands at about US$50 million and includes: one investment in the

    telecommunication sector (Roshan) and two operations in financial markets (First Microfinance Bank,
    Afghanistan International Bank––trade facility).
7. IFC’s strong Advisory Services program has been supporting the private sector in the areas of access to
    finance, horticulture/agribusiness, and investment climate. IFC’s investments have had a transformational
    impact (in terms of access to finance and outreach), particularly in the microfinance and telecommunication
    sectors – providing phone connections to 7.2 million customers, increasing access to SME loans (43,572
    loans outstanding worth $48 million), and supporting around 2,500 jobs.
8. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has US$ 154 million of gross exposure in
   Afghanistan, supporting telecommunications and agribusiness projects. In 2013, MIGA launched its
   Conflict Affected and Fragile Economies Facility, which is supports the agency’s exposure in Afghanistan.
   MIGA currently supports three projects in Afghanistan, of which one is a joint effort with IFC in the
   telecommunications sector to support the telecom operator MTN. The other two operations are MIGA-
   only projects related to dairy and cashmere production.
