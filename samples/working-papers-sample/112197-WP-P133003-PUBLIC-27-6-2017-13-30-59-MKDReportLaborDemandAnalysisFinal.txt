Executive Summary

Transition and labor reallocation – towards better jobs in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia

1. Productive employment depends on a dynamic private sector. Good jobs are in short supply in the
   former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Sustainable, better employment opportunities must come
   from higher labor demand from a dynamic and internationally competitive private sector – the result
   of an advanced economic transition from a state controlled to a market led economy. This note
   focuses on job creation from the perspective of enterprise sector dynamics in the former Yugoslav
   Republic of Macedonia. The purpose is to understand, better, the dynamics of job creation – where
   and how firms and jobs are created – and the most important constraints to job creation from the
   firm perspective. Drawing on several sources of data, including firm registry, data on
   entrepreneurship, labor force surveys, and policy indicators, the note contributes to the job
   diagnostics necessary to devise relevant policy to increase job opportunities in the former Yugoslav
   Republic of Macedonia and is intended to provide guidance to researchers and policymakers in other
   countries wishing to understand better the role of the private sector in employment.
2. Despite some significant business climate reforms, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has
   not seen private sector dynamics or “entrepreneurship” improve sufficiently. In recent years, the
   former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been taking broad and substantive steps towards
   reforming its business climate and making especially business entry easier. Reforms have also focused
   on increasing openness by fostering opportunities for international trade and inflows of foreign direct
   investment. Nonetheless, the private formal sector remains subdued in the former Yugoslav Republic
   of Macedonia, accounting for a limited share of employment. Entrepreneurial activity – as measured
   by self-employment – is also relatively low.
3. In sum, the transition of workers and jobs from low productivity sectors to higher productivity
   sectors has stalled in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Prior to the economic crisis,
   countries which had advanced more in the transition process saw higher productivity growth than the
   former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, more inflows of workers into the services sector, and
   substantive net job creation. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in contrast, labor
   reallocation is still incomplete. One fifth of the population remains in low productivity agriculture and
   one third is informally employed. Between 2007 and 2011 the formal private sector created only 12
   percent of all new jobs.


What kind of jobs, in what kind of firms, are created in the formal sector?

4. Most formal private sector employment is in small firms, with limited growth prospects. Firm
   registry data show that in 2011, more than half of all employment was in firms with less than 50
   employees, and one third in firms with a turnover below 10 million denars. One in three workers was
   employed in micro-firms with less than 10 employees.
5. Job creation in formal private firms fell significantly during the crisis, as young firms stopped
   creating jobs. While total employment numbers remained stable, the economic slowdown visibly
   slowed down job creation in formal firms. Young firms were most volatile: they created the majority




                                                                                                          7
    of jobs between 2007 and 2011 on an aggregate level, but their contribution was significantly
    diminished during the economic crisis. The slowdown in job creation in younger firms is consistent
    with a slow-down in net firm creation. Firm entry peaked in 2007, when one in five active firms was
    created that year, but had fallen to half by 2011. Observing poorer survival conditions for firms, fewer
    persons were prepared to enter a business venture.
6. Gross job flows indicate a significant level of churning, which in turn points to an unfinished
   transition process. The patterns in transition countries have been more or less consistent over time:
   as old state-led industrial firms went out of business, massive job destruction ensued. With time, as
   economies stabilized and moved closer to a market economy, gross job creation took up in new
   sectors of industries and services, and job destruction came down as the reallocation process
   continued, so that net job creation and gross job creation became more closely aligned. However, job
   turnover (churning) is still high in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, compared to more
   advanced transition countries. That is, high destruction, and high creation of jobs still co-exist.
7. More productive firms are now creating more jobs. In the first half of the 2000s, less productive
   sectors and firms created more jobs. Between 2007 and 2011, overall, the productivity of employment
   did not increase, as informal employment and employment in low productivity activities like
   agriculture and trade increased. However, this report shows that since 2007, within the formal
   enterprise sector, more productive firms have been creating jobs, even during the economic crisis.
   This is a tentative sign of an acceleration of the reallocation towards a higher productivity structure
   within the firm sector.


Entrepreneurship and opportunities

8. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has relatively low levels of entrepreneurship and
   entrepreneurship is driven by push factors. While the absolute numbers differ depending on source,
   the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia consistently displays low overall levels of self-
   employment or established business ownership, compared to other middle income countries, and
   even by comparison to other ECA countries. Data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor shows
   that in 2012, only seven percent of adults are in established ownership. Entrepreneurship, moreover,
   appears to be more necessity than opportunity driven, as 50 percent of those in early stage
   entrepreneurship reported starting a business for lack of other employment options.
 9. A significant share of those that are wage employed, or not working, would like to be
    entrepreneurs, but few take steps towards opening a business. In the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia, the share of wage employed that would like to be self-employed is higher than elsewhere,
    but these latent entrepreneurs are less likely than in other countries to take steps towards opening a
    business. Women, and poorer workers, are very unlikely to approach entrepreneurship.
10. These latent entrepreneurs may be hindered by lack of access to productive assets . In the ECA
    region, latent as well as actual entrepreneurship is driven by access to credit (where women and
    poorer workers are likely to be disadvantaged), and by social networks and private sector experience
    (which women and poorer workers have less of). Moreover, the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia may also be in a low entrepreneurship trap: the low level of competitive industries and
    enterprises as well as the small size of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia contributes to
    keeping entrepreneurship subdued, for lack of spillover effects and demonstration effects.




                                                                                                          8
Improving the investment climate

11. What role does the business climate and overall economic conditions play for the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia’s subdued enterprise sector? The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
    has made headway on reforming its economic system: Different indicators of competitiveness,
    economic transition and more narrowly business environment reforms conclusively show that the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made important progress compared to its peers and has
    improved its ranking over the past ten years. However, the agenda is far from complete.
12. Credit constraints and skills shortages are still important obstacles to business. Access to credit is
    considered a major constraint in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, more so than in other
    countries. This reinforces the message from that entrepreneurship is also determined by access to
    credit – both entry, survival and expansion. Skills shortages are a problem for more modern firms.
    Firms with foreign ownership, and firms in services outside the retail sector, consider lack of an
    appropriately skilled work force a major issue. Other research shows that skills shortages are, indeed,
    a constraint to hiring for especially modern and more dynamic firms competing on international
    markets.
13. Weak institutions manifest themselves in the investment climate, especially failings in the judiciary
    sector, and unfair competition from informal firms. FYR Macedonia’s slow transition is both cause
    and result of insufficiently developed institutions that ensure rule of law, transparency, and more
    generally good governance. Macedonian firms are small on average, which may partly explain why
    the practices of informal firms (who are likely to compete with smaller and less established firms)
    feature as the main constraint to doing business in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
    Perhaps most significantly, the issue of poor governance emerges frequently as a problem. In fact,
    perceptions of corruption and distrust in the courts system are more significant obstacles according
    to Macedonian firms than is the case in other ECA countries.
14. Small firms are more severely affected by these constraints. Larger firms have a higher internal
    capacity to deal with red tape, manage bribes, and wait out results from a slow and unpredictable
    courts system, and have easier access to finance. Thus, young, small and more dynamic firms are likely
    to be held back by the weak institutions.


Unfinished Business: Going forward

15. To provide both new jobs and sustainable income opportunities, the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia’s private sector needs to take off. Only with higher job creation in the private formal
    sector can the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia look forward to more productive employment
    opportunities for its work force. To increase labor demand from firms, they need higher demand for
    the goods and services they could or do produce and better conditions to enter and stay in business.
    The review of different constraints suggests that while there have been improvements in the overall
    business climate, progress on deeper reforms has been slow.
16. Is the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in a low entrepreneurship trap? Limited size of the
    domestic market means that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia must become competitive
    on international markets to sustain higher levels of demand. The small size of the economy also means
    that in absolute numbers, there are few entrepreneurs, even if firm density is comparable with other
    countries. Since higher entrepreneurial density tends to increase entrepreneurship further, the




                                                                                                         9
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may need to go further to increase entrepreneurial
    representation from abroad, by encouraging foreign direct investment and encourage cross-country
    business ventures. Focusing on production clusters and value chains can be of significant use to small
    and medium-sized enterprises that often face difficulties in achieving economies of scale in their
    production.
17. Governance needs strengthening. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has embarked on an
    ambitious reform agenda to encourage private sector investment and growth. However, whereas
    significant progress has been made on some areas, such as making it easy to open up a business, other
    areas of reform need more attention to increase firm survival and expansion. Weak governance
    institutions affect business in indirectly and directly: indirectly, because weak institutions hold back
    the implementation of a relatively ambitious reform agenda, and directly, because poor governance
    is an important constraints for business, and hit the small and more vulnerable firms more forcefully,
    especially so courts system and a high incidence of corruption. Reforming the judicial system is also
    central to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s EU accession process.
18. Identifying and building the right kind of skills will be important to insert the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia fully in the modern global production chain. While there is wide recognition
    that there are not enough skills for the modern economy in the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia, there is still limited information regarding what these skills are or should be. As one step
    in this process, the World Bank has undertaken a Skills Measurement Program (STEP) survey of both
    demand and supply, analyzing the availability of and demand for skills – in the broadest sense – among
    the labor force and by private employers.

                            1. Introduction

19. More jobs, and more productive jobs, are needed in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
    Although the Macedonian economy has created employment in recent years, the rate of job creation
    has not been sufficient to bring FYR Macedonia to employment levels close to those of the European
    Union. Less than half of the adult population (48 percent) is employed, and only half of those jobs are
    in the private formal sector. Women and some ethnic minorities, particularly Albanian and Roma, face
    strikingly poor prospects. In South-eastern and Eastern European region, the global financial crisis
    tended to slow down job creation significantly after 2008, and many of the young and innovative firms
    were lost in the process (Arias and others, 2014). The crisis had a smaller effect on labor markets in
    the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, despite increasing international linkages through trade
    and investment. Unlike in many neighboring countries many jobs had never transitioned out from the
    agricultural and informal sectors, and so the potential for a reversal was smaller. Even when compared
    to countries hit much worse by the crisis, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is an outlier in
    Europe in terms of access to productive employment, with only one third of adults in a job. And many
    of these jobs – almost one third in 2011 – are in the informal sector, whether for self-employed (those
    working for themselves) or wage workers (working for pay for an enterprise).

20. This note addresses the formal enterprise sector and its potential to provide more and better jobs
    in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. A host of different factors, including lack of adequate
    skills in the population and incentive systems that discourage work, influence labor market outcomes
    in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, lack of dynamism and low demand for labor
    in the private formal sector is clearly one of the most critical obstacles to increasing jobs and labor
    earnings. To improve labor market outcomes for the population at large, access to employment must
    increase, and policy must help improve the productivity of smaller informal activities, including




                                                                                                        11
    agriculture. To sustainably improve jobs, the private formal sector must nevertheless become the
    strong force for economic development.
21. “Firm dynamics and job creation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” forms part of an
    analytical agenda focused on promoting employment and productivity in the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia. This agenda has included topics of significant relevance to the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia such as skills, informality of work, and private sector development.
    The objective of the note is to provide an understanding of the characteristics of the private formal
    sector from the perspective of employment. Additionally, the note is intended to serve as a
    “blueprint” for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as well as other countries of the kind of
    demand-side focused analysis that can be undertaken using business registry data and other sources
    of data in an integrative approach.
22. To provide both new jobs and sustainable income opportunities, production and employment must
    shift to firms with higher development potential – notably those with higher productivity levels.
    Higher productivity provides a basis for increasing income for employers and employees in firms and
    is necessary to successfully compete in international markets. Macedonian firms are unlikely to be
    able to compete in low productivity, low wage sectors, not least because labor costs were increasing
    fast prior to the crisis. Increasing productivity, based on innovation and constant product and services
    upgrading, will therefore be a necessary step to expanding markets.
23. Whether more productive jobs are created will depend on whether there is high enough demand
    for the goods and services produced by the firms, on whether firms are able to start or develop their
    business when they face higher potential demand, and on whether firms can opt for more labor-
    intensive technologies. From the enterprise perspective, outcomes are thus influenced by overall
    environment for starting a business and developing business opportunities, and by the costs
    associated with hiring workers.
24. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made significant progress on the business
    environment, per various international indices and indicators. In 2007, 2009 and 2011, The former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was among the top ten reforming country in the World Bank’s Doing
    Business indicators. Ranking 75 out of 178 countries in 2006, the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia moved up rapidly and consistently and by 2012 had improved its position to number 23
    out of 185 countries.
25. These indicators reflect an ambitious reform program developed to foster private sector growth
    and job creation. The reform program has been premised on both improving the business climate
    more generally (especially since the mid-2000s), and attracting foreign direct investment in key value-
    adding sectors, in specific Technological Industrial Development Zones. Merchandise exports
    increased by 11 percent during 2011-2014, largely driven by the automotive industry and associated
    sectors, and the technological sophistication of exports also increased. So far, there have not been
    strong spillovers to the local economy, however.1

26. So why are job outcomes not improving? Given the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s strong
    record on business environment reform, the private sector contribution to job creation is
    disappointing. Accompanying economic and sector work by the World Bank (Box 1) has shown that
    jobs remain in the informal and/or low productivity sectors, and that at the same time, Macedonian
    firms experience a skills shortage. It also shows lack of dynamism and competitiveness on the firm
    side. Exporting firms are overwhelmingly small, and have low survival rates. Has the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia not reformed sufficiently in some critical areas, or are there other factors
    holding back labor demand and firm growth?
27. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s small size – a population of two million, a work force
    of about 600,000 persons, a minority of which are employed – means that the economy runs into
    several constraints in terms of critical mass of products, services, and competences. One such
    constraint is the very limited domestic market, especially in view of relatively high poverty rates and
    low access to paid work. As a result, the economy cannot rely exclusively on domestic demand as an
    engine of growth. A second is that with a small population and work force, there may be a lack of
    specific competencies needed for production, which must be possible to source outside of the
    country. A third is that firms depend on imports for much of its production as the country has limited
    supplies of natural resources and intermediate products. All of this means that the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia must look to the rest of the world to complement its skills, products and
    services base.
28. This note presents an analysis of the formal enterprise sector and entrepreneurship in the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia just before and during the global economic crisis. It is a data
    intensive exercise and draws heavily on firm registry and other relevant sources of data on the
    landscape of firms, as well as on a set of different indicators that measure progress on economic

    transition and business climate reform (Box 2). The first part of the paper provides an overview of
    employment patterns in the formal enterprise sector, how these patterns play out terms of underlying
    jobs and labor productivity patterns, and on the role of entrepreneurship. The second part looks at
    different measures of business reform and how these relate to jobs outcomes.

                        Box 1: Conclusions from recent Economic and Sector Work
 The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has managed the global economic crisis well. However, neither the
 higher growth period preceding the crisis, nor the volatile period from 2008 onwards, has implied any
 reallocation of work force across economic sectors.
 Analysis of the labor force surveys (World Bank, 2013) shows that most jobs were created in low productivity
 and lower skills sectors over 2000-2011, and that informality has increased. In addition, employment and salaries
 increased in the public sector, and real wage growth exceeded productivity growth, which in turn hampered
 competitiveness. Most net job creation has taken place through expansion of wage work rather than firm birth
 (self-employment).
 Exporting firms account for one third of employment in the formal sector and are more productive than other
 firms (World Bank, 2012). However, exports are relatively unsophisticated, as half are classified as low technology
 products and especially textiles and apparel are losing competitiveness. Most of the firms are small and survival
 rates are low. Some share of foreign ownership tends to improve competitiveness, however. Recent analysis
 show that
 Skills are becoming an important constraint, especially to more dynamic firms with an export potential, and for
 both white collar and blue collar jobs. (World Bank, forthcoming 2016, and 2010).
 Hiring workers, especially at the low skill end, is still relatively costly in the former Yugoslav Republic of
 Macedonia. When asked about labor related constraints, firms in the automotive industry consider the overall
 wage level the second most important problem, after skills levels (World Bank, forthcoming 2016). Although
 there have been reforms to lower the personal income taxes and social contributions in recent years, they remain
 regressive and affect mostly low wage earners.

Box 2: Firm Dynamics and Job Creation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Sources of data
 The note incorporates different data-sets to shed light on job creation from the labor demand side of jobs in The
 former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia:
        Labor force survey data, from 2007 to 2011.
        Enterprise registry data, from 2004 to 2011, incorporating about 55,000 firms annually.
        Estimates on latent and actual entrepreneurship (non-wage employment) from the Life in Transition
         Survey, 2010 (LiTS), prepared for the World Bank report Back to Work: Growing with Jobs in Europe and
         Central Asia (Arias et al. 2014).
        Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), using a representative sample of about 2,000 working adults.
         the number of months business have been in operation.
        Additional investment climate data from the Global Competitiveness index (World Economic Forum),
         Enterprise Surveys and Doing Business indicators from the World Bank, the Transition Index (EBRD), and
         the Life in Transition Survey (EBRD).

    2. Transition and the jobs challenge

29. The economic transition process from state led to market economy should be reflected in a move
    from low to higher productivity jobs, firms and sectors. In advanced economies, the enterprise sector
    provides the lion share of employment. This section looks at the extent to which the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia has seen a shift towards more productive employment over time by looking
    at the characteristics of employment, of the firms that provide employment, and at gross job flows
    across the economy.



2.1. Incomplete structural transformation
30. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has experienced volatile growth with strong set-backs,
    and economic convergence with comparators has been slow. Like other transition countries, the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia experienced some years of negative growth triggered by the
    breakdown of the economic system. The recovery towards the end of the 1990s was drastically halted
    in 2001-2002 as a result of the civil unrest, and a second growth recovery period in the mid-2000s was
    interrupted by the global financial crisis (Figure 3, left panel). The former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia has lagged behind the ECA region’s average growth levels in the past, and has not caught
    up with neighboring countries in Southeast Europe since the drop in the early 2000s (Figure 3, right
    panel).

31. From the employment perspective, restructuring is still ongoing in the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia. The collapse of the state led systems in the former communist countries led to a wide
    dismantling of production in obsolete and uncompetitive industrial state owned enterprises. In the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia some twenty percent of workers are still in the agriculture
    sector which has the lowest levels of productivity and earnings, and conversely, the services sector is
    still comparatively small, absorbing around half of the work force. A shift of workers out of agriculture,




                                                                                                                                                                                                                             15
    especially into the services sector, is consequently a first step towards increasing the productivity of
    employment. However, restructuring can also take place within sectors, as workers move into more
    productive firms when less competitive firms reduce or close their business. In the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia, both transitions are needed.
32. Self-employment is also likely to increase in the early and middle stages of transition, and fall as the
    reallocation process is completed. As economies develop and the formal wage sector is increasing,
    self-employment rates would be expected to fall. However, opportunities and necessities both
    contribute to higher self-employment at the early stages of transition. In state controlled economic
    systems, self-employment had previously been subdued. Liberalization provided new entrepreneurial
    opportunities. At the same time, demand for labor in state owned enterprises fell dramatically, while
    wage employment in modern sectors took time to take off. As a result of these pull and push factors,
    self-employment consequently increased in many transition economies. In some more advanced
    economies, formal wage employment in modern sectors has increased (reducing the push-factor) and
    self-employment has fallen back (Figure 4).

33. From the enterprise perspective, countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia generally
    experienced significant net job creation prior to the onset of the global economic crisis .2 Countries
    that had advanced further in the transition process had generally experienced sustained net job
    creation for some time, while countries with slow restructuring had seen less or no net job

  ”Net job creation” is the difference between all jobs created in expanding firms, less all jobs lost in contracting
firms. Significant reallocation – and productivity growth - can take place without net job creation, if workers leave
less productive firms and jobs and are hired by more productive firms.

    destruction. Recently established/younger firms generally played an important role in job creation
    but these same enterprises were also more vulnerable to the crisis (Arias and others, 2014). This is
    consistent with other evidence that more productive and innovative firms may be more credit
    constrained and therefore more likely to go under during a crisis (Paci, Revenga and Rijkers, 2012).
34. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, this has not been the case: work has not shifted into
    more productive sectors and jobs, self-employment appears to be stagnant, and net job creation
    was slow in the formal sector. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s business environment
    has improved. After a decade of reform and restructuring, most countries in the ECA region saw
    productivity growth increase between 1999 and 2005. As workers left the manufacturing industry and
    took up jobs in the services sector, productivity increased. However, the process of restructuring has
    not been even throughout the region. Those who embarked later on the reform process, including
    the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, have still not seen the significant structural shifts needed
    to move into a functioning market economy (World Bank, 2013).
35. The global economic crisis played a role in dampening economic growth, firm expansion and
    employment, but the employment problem appears to be structural rather than cyclical. In fact, the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia did not see significant increases in productive employment
    in the period of higher economic growth prior to the crisis, either.
36. After 25 years of economic transition, the reallocation of resources in the Macedonian economy –
    including labor – is thus incomplete. First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia remains an
    outlier in terms of lack of access to employment. Two in three Macedonian adults are unemployed or
    inactive (Figure 5). For those that do work, agriculture still absorbs a comparatively large share of the
    employed by European standards (20 percent of the employed and seven percent of the adult
    population). The share of adults in the services sector, at 18 percent of the adult population, is among
    the lowest in the entire ECA region.

37. The formal private sector is not creating sufficient jobs. Unlike in more developed economies, most
    Macedonian’s currently find their jobs outside the formal private enterprise sector. The problem is
    both static and dynamic: the private formal sector is small, and it is still creating fewer jobs than other
    sectors. In fact, jobs fall out of the private formal sector at both the low and high skill end. The formal
    sector excluding public administration accounted for less than forty percent of employment in 2011
    and its share had been falling as jobs were destroyed between 2007 and 2011 (Figure 6, left).
38. Instead, the informal sector accounted for two thirds of all net employment creation, especially
    low skill jobs, while public administration became the main employer for tertiary educated workers
    (World Bank, 2013). Estimates of shadow economy activities suggest that the informal economy is
    indeed a significant phenomenon in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, equivalent to more
    than one third of GDP, compared to 17 percent of GDP for OECD countries on average (Schneider and
    others, 2010). Much of informal employment in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is due to
    the significant role of the agricultural sector, where half of all informal workers are, and where the
    rate of informality – the share of informal work in total employment – reaches 86 percent. However,
    there is also a significant informal work force in the non-agricultural sector, two thirds of them in
    three sectors only: manufacturing, construction and trade (Figure 6, right).

39. Structural transformation has been limited as labor productivity growth has taken place within
    sectors rather than through reallocation across sectors. Between 2002 and 2007, during times of
    relatively high growth, the economy was characterized by moderate labor productivity growth, very
    limited employment creation on a net basis, and limited shifts in employment structure (Figure 7).
    More specifically, employment in the agricultural and industrial sectors contracted while the services
    sector expanded. As a result, the share of work force engaged in agriculture fell from 24 to 18 percent
    while that of services increased from 43 to 50 percent (World Bank, 2009).
40. Labor productivity3 increased between 2002 and 2007, due to labor productivity gains – together
    with job destruction - within different sectors. Aggregate labor productivity increased by about 4.5
    percent per year, largely due to an increase in labor productivity within the industrial sector (in
    particular) and agriculture, as surplus jobs were destroyed in these two sectors. Much less
    productivity growth was due to reallocation gains, i.e. workers changing from low productivity sectors
    into higher productivity sectors. In other words, workers did not benefit from aggregate productivity
    growth with access to better jobs in new sectors (World Bank, 2009).
41. Since 2007, economic growth has been more subdued, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
    has seen very little labor productivity growth, and labor reallocation has stalled. Between 2007 and
    2011, employment growth picked up but was not accompanied by an increase in more productive job
    opportunities. The structural reallocation of workers actually impacted negatively on productivity, as
    more employment was created in the agricultural sector and the informal sector.
42. In sum, labor markets have far from completed their transition from low productivity to higher
    productivity jobs in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Too many people are deprived of
    any employment at all, and many workers and their families are still dependent on low productivity
    sectors like agriculture and informal work. The fact that employment patterns do not change
    significantly in response to global economic volatility bears witness to the fact that the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has still not completed its transition into a more modern economy.

2.2. The landscape of formal firms: where are the jobs?
43. Where and in what kind of enterprises do those in the formal sector work? This section looks at
    employment from the perspective of formal firms – those available in Macedonia’s firm registry.
    Arguably there can be very different kinds of dynamics going on within the firm sector, compared to
    the broader employment picture. The total number of employed in the firm registry amounts to just
    under 350,000, which corresponds to a little over half of all employment registered in the labor force
    survey. The registry includes firms of all sizes – most, as will be seen, are in fact very small.
44. Most employment is in small firms, with limited turnover and low innovation content. Nine out of
    ten firms in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are micro firms, with less than ten employees,
    and less than two percent of firms have more than 50 employees. More than half of all employees in
    registered firms work in firms with less than fifty employees, and one third of employees are in micro-
    firms (Figure 8, a). One third of the work force is in firms with annual turnover of less than 10 million
    Macedonian denars (about 160,000 euros). About one third of jobs are also among young firms, with
    less than 6 years in business. Though not shown here, the shares of young and small firms have fallen
    since 2007.




                                                                                                                                                                                                 20
45. The firm landscape largely lacks large dynamic firms. Compared to OECD countries, the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lacks especially large firms (Figure 8, b). The employment share of
    large firms is smaller than for e.g. Poland, Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which otherwise
    have similar levels of employment in micro and small firms (OECD, 2013). It is important to keep in
    mind that the size of informal sector matters for these comparisons as the surveys focus on formal
    sector. An even larger segment of micro-firms is likely to exist in the informal sector.
46. While all young firms are small, small firms are not necessarily young . Compared to the OECD, the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia also has fewer old firms, and more young firms. Nonetheless,
    since micro-firms predominate also among older firms, not all small firms are in fact young. Nearly
    one third of all firms exist since more than a decade, and half of all jobs are in older firms. Many firms
    simply do not grow beyond micro-size with time. It is nonetheless clear that the small-firm sector is
    diverse in terms of growth, technology, and employment potential.

                     characteristics, 2011                                       with OECD countries

47. Larger firms are not more productive in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a signal that
    resource allocation is not working well in the economy. In well-functioning market economies,
    productive firms should grow faster simply because efficient and more competitive firms have the
    opportunities to invest and expand, while inefficient ones are held back or forced to exit (see Iacavone
    and others, 2014). Under such circumstances, larger firms (in terms of employment) in particular
    should have higher levels of labor productivity. This would be a positive thing from a labor market
    perspective, since a larger share of employment by consequence would be in firms with higher labor
    productivity and the ability to provide better wages. The dominance of very small firms in the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia already suggests that growth enhancing investment does not pay off.
    In fact, although labor productivity4 is somewhat higher among older firms, there is no systematic
    relationship between size and productivity. As seen in Figure 9 a and b, while labor productivity levels
    are generally lowest among micro-firms, firms with more than fifty employees are generally less
    productive (with a distribution skewed to the left in Figure b) than those in firms between 10 and 49.

    Labor productivity in enterprises is calculated using total operating revenues per worker




                                                                                                                      21
    These are signs that that the private sector overall has very limited labor demand (many jobs are in
    micro-firms) and that more competitive firms are not able to grow further.

48. Throughout the crisis, younger firms accounted for a majority of new jobs. While young firms
    account for a small share of employment, they contributed much more significantly to job creation in
    the period 2007 and 2011 – between 60 and 80 percent of all new jobs (on a net basis) were created
    in firms with less than 4 years of age (Figure 10). This is consistent with evidence from other countries
    Central and Eastern Europe, where job creation typically was driven by some younger and dynamic
    firms.
49. Medium sized firms with between 50 and 249 employees, accounted for much of net job creation.
    Between 2007 and 2011, half of all jobs created in formal firms, on a net basis, were created in firms
    with between 50 and 249 employees, while small (below 50) and large (250 or more) accounted for
    about one quarter each. employees.
50. Net job creation fell during the crisis, as younger firms stopped creating new jobs. As the economic
    slowdown began to impact demand for labor, job creation slowed down, especially between 2010
    and 2011. The main reason for the slowdown was a dramatic drop in job creation among young firms.
    The low levels of job creation also reflected a general decline in net job creation among medium and
    large firms, and a significant increase in net job destruction among microfirms.
51. The patterns echo experiences from other Central and Eastern European countries. In particular,
    many of the new innovative firms that had been driving employment growth prior to the crisis were
    stunted or forced to exit. During favorable economic times, such firms would not have been credit
    constrained. However, more productive firms often operate with smaller margins and as such are
    more vulnerable to a credit crunch such as was happening after 2008. Thus, many young, dynamic
    and potentially fast growing firms were forced out of business, while older and larger firms survived.

2.3. Beyond net job creation: patterns of creation, destruction and reallocation of
     jobs

Stagnant employment growth can hide significant dynamics underneath. Successful reallocation implies
     that jobs shift from firms in less productive sectors to more productive ones, and that more
    productive firms within sectors open up or expand while less productive firms contract or exit
     altogether. In other words, some jobs must also be destroyed while others are created (see
52. Box 3 for a glossary on gross job flows). The economic restructuring process generally starts off with
    high job destruction in sectors that were important prior to transition, especially heavy industry. With
    time, new sectors take off, and gross job creation increases. Over time, the role for firm entry and exit
    in overall job turnover has also diminished. The reallocation, thus, can take place both through firm
    entry and exit, and through a simultaneous expansion and contraction of existing (and surviving) firms.
    As is logical, contracting and expanding firms tend to be larger, all else equal, than firms that entry
    and exit (World Bank, 2009).
53. High firm and job turnover can be the consequence of competitive pressures or of a dysfunctional
    business climate. In many ECA countries, high firm turnover contributed to productivity growth in
    early transition stages (Alam and others, 2008). High firm entry can be evidence of a dynamic
    economy: a thriving private business sector and private sector job creation relies on entrepreneurial
    drive and new business ideas that are expressed in the creation of firms. It is also clear, however, that
    many small businesses, and especially own account work, are born as the result of “push” factors,
    such as lack of other employment options given one’s endowments and situation in life. In a similar
    vein, depending on country context, high levels of firm exit could either mean highly competitive
    circumstances resulting in rapid destruction of unproductive firms, or a bad investment climate that
    “kills off” firms with potential prematurely.

54. Firm entry and exit remains high in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Compared to other
    European countries, firm turnover is high in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in both
    industry and services sectors. In 2007 (a year for which there is comparable data on firm demography
    in OECD countries), new firms accounted for some twenty percent of the total number of firms in both
    the industry and services sector, while firm exits accounted for between ten and fifteen percent.
    These rates are high compared to other European countries, where firm entry rates generally hover
    between five and ten percent and likely reflect the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s status
    as a less mature market economy (Figure 11).

55. However, firm creation dropped in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in response to the
    economic crisis. The bureaucratic costs, in terms of time, fee, and procedures, of opening up a
    business are low in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – in 2016, the country ranks as number
    two in the world in terms of ease of starting a business (World Bank Doing Business Indicators, 2016).
    While economic growth slowed down as of 2009, firm entry did not drop until 2011 (Figure 12a).
    Greater hesitance to start a firm is likely to have been linked to a fall in firm survival rates observed
    as of 2010, in other words, the probability that a firm that was started in 2009 survived until 2010 was
    lower than previous years (Figure 12b). This is consistent with the drop in job creation by younger
    firms in 2011, and the pattern mirrors that of other ECA countries, which also saw a drop in new firm
    creation in the wake of the crisis.

                                     Gross job creation in one year (in a particular sector) is the sum of all employment gains that year in firms
                                     (in that sector) that start up or expand during the year.
                                     Gross job destruction is the sum of all employment losses in firms that contract or shut down (in that
                                     sector) during the year.
                                     Net job creation is the difference between gross job creation and gross job destruction.
                                     Gross job reallocation is the sum of gross job creation and gross job destruction, and characterizes the
                                     dynamics (extent of job creation and job destruction) of the labor market. Thus it is quite possible to have
                                     high gross job reallocation but low net employment growth (if high creation and destruction cancel out).
                                     Such dynamics, while not leading to more jobs, can lead to better/worse jobs, with higher/lower
                                     productivity and related earnings possibilities.
                                     Excess job reallocation is the difference between the gross job reallocation and the absolute value of the
                                     net employment growth. This measure captures the amount of churning by firms, i.e. how much actual
                                     job reallocation exceeds what would be necessary to accommodate the net change in employment.
                                     These indicators are expressed in thousands of jobs or as rates by dividing them by total employment
                                     numbers (in a particular sector).



56. Analysis of gross job flows for the years 2002-2006 undertaken for the 2009 Poverty Assessment
    showed that job churning was very high in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. During one
    year, about 3 in 5 jobs were reallocated (created or destroyed), and for each job created on a net
    basis, as many as thirteen jobs had to be reallocated across the economy. The analysis also concluded
    that while firm turnover was comparatively high in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia even




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                25
    compared with transition countries, firm survival improved and that most jobs were in fact destroyed
    through company downsizing (World Bank, 2009). Using more recent data from the period prior to
    the global crisis, the World Bank’s “Back to Work” Report showed that there are significant differences
    in gross job flows across transition countries and that these differences are related to how far the
    transition process has come in countries – advanced modernizers, e.g. Estonia and Poland
    experienced strong gross job creation and some job destruction before the financial crisis, while in
    countries less advanced on the structural reforms, jobs reallocation was still very significant (Arias and
    others, 2014).
57. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still displays high rates of churning. Analysis of
    enterprise level data for 2007 to 2011 shows that in this period, to create 27,000 jobs on a net basis,
    five times as many jobs had to be created and four times as many destroyed. The degree of churning
    intensified during the global crisis so that while net job creation in the enterprise sector fell, excess
    job reallocation increased because gross job destruction increased. Expressed in rates (share of total
    firm employment), both job creation and job destruction were in 2009 about twice as high as those
    in Poland and Estonia. Many more jobs were thus created and destroyed across Macedonian labor
    markets, for a given number of jobs, than in the more advanced economies (Figure 13, a, b and c).
58. Although job turnover is part of the reallocation process towards more productive employment,
    such high levels of churning signals inefficiencies. For example, it may indicate a relative increase in
    temporary contracts as firms respond to economic uncertainty by avoiding. Alternatively, if jobs
    turnover is high, but job search and matching mechanisms are inefficient, a large share of workers
    may be out of a job for lengthy periods of time, although there is demand for labor in the economy.
59. There was more job churning among larger firms than smaller firms. Firms with more than 50
    employees saw some limited net job destruction, but significant churning – job creation and job
    destruction happening at the same time (Figure 13, d).
60. Existing, surviving firms account for most of both gross job creation and job destruction. Jobs can
    also be created and destroyed through firm creation and firm exit. Adding firm creation and
    destruction to the picture adds even more dynamics to total jobs turnover, but firms that were and
    remained in business account for more job flows. Since start-ups are small, and firm survival is lowest
    among small firms, most gross job creation is likely to come from larger firms that expand in larger
    chunks. Indeed, expanding firms accounted for more than twice as many new jobs (gross) as those
    created by new firms. Similarly, more jobs were lost through shedding in larger (but surviving) firms
    than destroyed by firms going out of business. The fall in net job creation during the crisis reflects
    mostly an increase in redundancies in existing firms (Figure 13, e).
61. On the positive side, within the formal sector, firms with higher labor productivity created more
    jobs. In fact, the twenty percent most productive firms contributed to 60 percent of net job creation
    between 2007 and 2011 (Figure 13, f). They did so more efficiently than other groups, as their shares
    of total gross job creation and – in particular – gross job destruction were much smaller. While overall
    job creation in The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as discussed above was low quality (with
    an emphasis on agriculture and informal jobs), within the enterprise sector, the quality of jobs may
    have improved as productive firms survived the economic crisis better.

62. As elsewhere in ECA and in more advanced economies, small share of firms account for a high share
    of gross job creation. In more advanced economies so called “Gazelles” – a few specific, often young,
    innovative and competitive firms – often grow more rapidly in terms of employment than other firms
    and account, in fact, for the bulk of all jobs (see e.g. Birch and Medoff, 1994, or Henrekson and
    Johansson, 2011). Unlocking the growth potential of such firms is thus of particular importance to
    increase labor demand. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, job creation was also
    concentrated among few firms between 2007 and 2011. The five percent of firms that created most
    jobs in fact accounted for half of all jobs created between 2007 and 2011; the top 20 percent job
    creating firms accounted for almost three in four jobs (Table 1).
63. These top job creating firms were significantly more productive than other firms and – while
    generally small – also larger than the average firm in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
    Compared to other firms, gazelles were also more likely to be foreign owned. Most of them were
    active in trade, manufacturing, or construction, but compared to other firms, gazelles are less likely
    to be in trade, and significantly more likely to be in manufacturing and construction. Overall, this
    confirms that the group of small firms is diverse in nature, level of productivity, and employment
    potential.

    3. Promoting firm creation and expansion in the former Yugoslav
       Republic of Macedonia

64. How can the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia encourage more job creation in firms? The
    survival and growth of firms depends on the existence of potential entrepreneurs and on a favorable
    business climate. How can the “gazelles” identified before be encouraged to form and prosper?
    Although it is in principal easy to start a business in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, most
    firms remain very small, even exports oriented firms, and survival rates are low and have been falling.
    This section looks at the challenge from both the perspective of firm creation and from that of more
    incomplete transition reform. It addresses the level of entrepreneurship in the Macedonian economy,
    and the determinants of why people want to, try to, and succeed in opening a business. It
    subsequently looks at outstanding areas in economic reforms, with a focus on obstacles that stand
    out as particularly important for the business sector.



3.1. Fostering entrepreneurship
65. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has a relatively low level of “entrepreneurship”, in fact
    similar to the level of advanced economies in Western Europe. About 7 percent of the adult (15+)
    population is self-employed – a surprisingly low number, given the relatively high levels of poverty
    and the lack of other job opportunities witnessed in low employment rates. Data from the Global
    Entrepreneurship Monitor 2012 show that in The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a small
    share of adults have started or are in the process of starting a business (Figure 14a). These low levels
    of entrepreneurship place the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a middle income country,
    alongside more mature market economies with higher levels of employment and welfare. The former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is much behind Latin American or Asian countries, and has lower
    rates of entrepreneurship than the average ECA country at all entrepreneurship stages except
    established businesses.
66. Self-employment in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is largely the result of necessity
    and lack of other opportunities. Moreover, the type of “entrepreneurship” existing in the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia appears to be much less driven by the wish to take advantage of
    business opportunities, than by the necessity of working for oneself for lack of other opportunities
    (Figure 14b). The relative emphasis on push versus pull factors sets the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia further apart from comparators. This is where the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
    is furthest away from more advanced economies in Western Europe. Where formal wage employment
    or a supportive safety net is an option, people become entrepreneurs if they see a business
    opportunity. This is not the case in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It would thus appear
    that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia through the economic transition path would have to
    increase entrepreneurship rates before returning to the level registered in more advanced economies.

67. Nonetheless, a significant share of those not working or who are wage employed, are interested in
    becoming entrepreneurs. Latent entrepreneurs include all those in the population who, given the
    option, would wish to be self-employed. According to the Life in Transition Survey, the share of latent
    entrepreneurs among the wage employed is higher in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
    than in other ECA countries. One fifth of those who are wage employed would want to be running
    their own business in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, compared to around 15 percent in
    other European ECA countries. In general, and irrespective of the measure used, women are
    significantly less likely than men to want to be entrepreneurs. There is also a considerably difference
    between the poor and the more well-off. These gaps are higher in the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia than in other ECA countries or in Western Europe.

68. What are the hurdles to a more opportunity driven entrepreneurship? Several explanations emerge
    from the analysis of entrepreneurship: the difficulties for latent entrepreneurs to move from idea to
    action, the low survival rate of firms, and – as discussed earlier - the difficulties for more productive
    firms to flourish.
69. Few latent entrepreneurs moved actively to open their own business. Relatively few of latent
    entrepreneurs actually took steps towards opening a firm. The very poorest were the least likely to
    do so - nine out of ten self-declared latent entrepreneurs in the poorest group (lowest consumption
    quartile) did not take any steps towards opening a business. This corresponds to half the ratio
    compared to other ECA countries and one third of that of Western Europe. Female potential
    entrepreneurs are also much less likely to take steps towards business than in more advanced
    economies.
70. A majority of those who attempted to open a firm succeeded in doing so. The key hurdle appears to
    be in moving from idea to action – among those who did attempt to establish a business, some 70
    percent succeeded. However, success rates are nonetheless lower in the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia (and ECA countries in general) than in Western Europe.
71. A mix of soft and hard factors matter for entrepreneurship. Cross country analysis shows that
    attitudes towards, and actual levels of, entrepreneurships are affected by a number of factors. Access
    to credit is, unsurprisingly, particularly important for succeeding in setting up a business.
    Entrepreneurship is also higher among those with private sector experience, and in areas with higher
    business density. Women entrepreneurs are also more likely to be organized in associations.
    However, “soft”, or personal factors – for example attitudes to risk – also matter greatly (Box 4).

                        Box 4: What determines latent and actual entrepreneurship?
 Multivariate analysis of how different factors affect attitudes to entrepreneurship, the decision to become an
 entrepreneur, and the likelihood to succeed suggests that although hard economic facts matter (in particular
 access to credit, economic agglomeration, and a favorable business climate), the decision to become and the
 likelihood to succeed as an entrepreneur are also substantially affected by "softer" factors related to attitudes,
 social connections, and past employment history.
 Demographics: For all types of entrepreneurship (latent, attempted, succeeded), rates are higher among men.
 And among women, younger women tend to have more successful transitions from attempting to start a business
 to successfully starting a business than older ones. A possible hypothesis is that this may have something to do
 with competing commitments during the childbearing years that lead to lower levels of labor market attachment
 among older women. Latent entrepreneurs are also more likely to be older, married, have higher consumption
 per capita.
 Private sector experience: Those in the private sector more likely to be latent entrepreneurs. Such private sector
 experience seems very important. Conditional on being a latent entrepreneur, whether one attempts to start a
 business is significantly associated with private sector employment. Successful transitions from attempting to
 start a business to actually starting a business also associated significantly with private sector experience.
 Networks: Social networks are important but active membership in organizations are much more important for
 women. In fact, such memberships are also significantly associated with attempting to start a business. One
 possibility: because women tend to have lower LFP, active memberships offset the lack of labor market networks.
 Attitudes towards risk: Risk preferences are very important and they dominate other attitudinal measures
 (including trust in institutions, trust in courts, etc,) Those at the top of the risk scale (1 to 10) are 16 percent more
 likely to be latent entrepreneurs. Are these risk measures meaningful? I would argue that they are -- preference
 for a high-risk job and willingness to move abroad are also associated with latent entrepreneurship.
 Economic geography and agglomeration: Business density matters: where there are more entrepreneurs, we see
 more latent entrepreneurship. The implication if entrepreneurship is generally desirable: some communities may
 be locked in a bad equilibrium.
 Credit: Access to finance is extremely important: The most successful business starters are the ones who were
 able to borrow money - they are 35 percent more likely to succeed than other firms.
 Ease of doing business: The cost (in time and money) of starting a business, the level of investor protection, and
 the cost involved with resolving insolvency, are all strongly related to the level of latent entrepreneurships.

3.2. Unfinished Business: Remaining constraints to firm creation, survival and
     expansion
72. How can the investment climate in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia best support the
    creation and growth of firms and jobs? If there is latent entrepreneurship in the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia, what would be needed to unleash it? How can the former Yugoslav Republic
    of Macedonia foster more jobs by more productive and competitive firms? This section looks at
    different aspects of business environment and how these constraints affect firms in the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, drawing on a set of sources of information. The Global
    Competitiveness (GCI) by the World Economic Forum measures the broad set of endowments,
    institutions and policies that foster competitiveness, on the premise that competitiveness is the key
    to productivity growth and economic prosperity (Box 5). The Transition Index (TI) produced by the




                                                                                                                        34
       European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, measures more narrowly progress on different
       market oriented economic reforms. The World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators (DB) and enterprise
       surveys (ES) focus more specifically on the business climate. The DB, GCI and ES include both hard
       (quantitative) and soft (qualitative, subjective) data from surveys of enterprise managers.
   73. Overall, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made significant reforms improve its
       competitiveness and conditions for private sector development. Progress on business environment
       reform is visible in a range of different indicators, including the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators
       (DBI), the Transition Index, and the Global Competitiveness Index.
   74. According to the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
       has improved its international competitiveness in recent years but is lagging behind its regional
       peers. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia now ranks number 73 out of 148 countries,
       compared to 84 out of 122 countries in 2006. Over time, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
       has thus successively shifted into the more competitive half of countries included in the index (Figure
       17, a). Nonetheless, the country remains behind a majority of neighboring countries in Central and
       Eastern Europe.

   Box 5: Nuts and Bolts of the Global Competitiveness Index
    The Global Competitiveness Index is built around different pillars of competitiveness. The emphasis on different
    policy areas for sustaining and increasing competitiveness depends on countries’ levels of development.
    Countries at early stages of development compete on account of their factor endowments, generally unskilled
    labor and natural resources. They depend on basic requirements like strong public and private institutions, well
    developed infrastructure, macroeconomic stability, and a healthy work force with at least basic education.
    As countries develop, they can no longer compete on cheap labor and natural resources alone. In the efficiency
    driven stage of development, competitiveness is driven by a set of efficiency enhancers: higher education and
    training, efficient goods markets and labor markets, developed financial markets, ability to absorb new
    technology, and access to large markets (domestic or foreign).
    Countries at high levels of development, finally, draw their competitive strength from new and unique products
    and services, applying new and sophisticated business processes, and with constant innovation.

75. Other measures also show evidence of business friendly reforms. For example, the EBRD’s transition
    reform index, measuring progress in different market economy reforms, shows that the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia has been steadily moving towards market economy principles, although reform
    pace has leveled out in the past five years (Figure 17, b). As seen in Figure 2 above, its ranking in the
    Doing Business Index has steadily improved. According to the DBI, in 2006, the former Yugoslav Republic
    of Macedonia’s business climate was at par with Kenya, Ghana and Mongolia. By 2013, The former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ranked number 25 out of 189 countries, had surpassed the Netherlands
    (ranked 28) and Japan (ranked 27), and was approaching Germany (ranked 21).

               transition index is the unweighted index of scores (from 1 to 4+) in the following areas: small and
               large scale privatization, price liberalization, trade and forex systems, governance and enterprise
               restructuring, and competition policy

76. Whereas the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s fundamental conditions for economic
    activity are in place, there is considerable way to go to develop into a more modern economy.
    According to the GCI, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia gets some of the most important
    fundamentals right for building a competitive economy, is generally weaker in terms of the efficiency
    enhancers that matter for more advanced economies, and has a considerably way to go to develop
    into a more innovative economy. The country benefitted until recently from a strong and predictable
    macroeconomic and political environment, and basic health and education standards are relatively
    high. However, road and railway infrastructure is weak (Figure 18, a). The policy analysis underpinning
    the CGI highlight that a large number of youth pass through tertiary education but quality problems
    prevail and further skills development is weak. Another major problem is the constraints posed by a
    very small domestic market and limited access to foreign markets. Goods and services are not
    particularly competitive. While there is high trust in the financial system, access to credit is limited.
    Macedonia also lacks the premises for innovation: there is no strong regional or product
    specialization, and the capacity to innovate is limited (Figure 18, a, and Annex Table 1).
77. After some rapid gains earlier in the transition process, the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia’s progress towards transition has leveled out. The former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia was making rapid progress, approaching the best performer of the transition countries.
    However, most gains were made early on, while less progress has been made between 2000 and 2012.

78. Narrowing in on individual areas of business constraints reveals some significant lacunas, especially
    credit, skills, and weak institutions. Two key dimensions stand out. The first dimension covers
    financial and human capital: in other words, the availability of credit and adequate work force skills.
    The second dimension concerns institutional failings in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
    Different perspectives of business conditions - the Transition Index, the Global Competitiveness Index,
    Enterprise Surveys – converge on the assessment that weaknesses with the economic and political
    governance system works against a level playing field for firms in the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia. These institutional failures manifest themselves in both the high levels of informality co-
    existing alongside formal firms and providing unfair competition, and the impact of corruption and
    what is widely seen as an unreliable judiciary system.
79. Access to finance is a key issue for firms in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. On average,
    finance is cited as the most important constraint among all countries in the World Bank’s enterprise
    surveys. However, a much higher share of firms consider it the most important constraint in the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia than is the case in peer countries. (The number of potentially
    viable firms that never come into being because of credit constraints may be even higher.)
    Notwithstanding improvements noted in access to credit in the DBI, over one fourth of all firms in
    enterprise surveys cite finance as the key problem to doing business, compared to one sixth in ECA
    countries. Some 20 percent of firms consider it a major obstacle (Figure 19, a and b). Financial
    deepening is low in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which may go some way towards
    explaining lack of credit (IMF, 2013).

80. Skills are considered an important problem for more modern firms. In the ES, skills do not emerge
    as a major issue in general. However, for firms with some foreign ownership, and for firms in services
    outside retail (which is dominated by small scale firms), skills are more of an obstacle. The former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Demand for Skills Survey also suggested that skills shortages were
    the main source of hiring difficulties for firms, and that they affected mainly modern and more
    dynamic firms that competed internationally (World Bank, 2010, see Box 1). Preliminary analysis of
    the World Bank STEP Employer Survey also supports the notion of lack of skills more generally, and
    that innovative firms in particular are more likely to find worker experience insufficient and the
    vocational education and training system lacking with respect to their needs (Figure 20). More
    generally, while only one third of firms reported difficulties in finding workers for different jobs, a
    large majority of those that did considered lack of adequate skills the main reason for difficulties in
    hiring (World Bank, forthcoming 2016).

81. Increasing labor costs may also be affecting the international competitiveness of Macedonian firms.
    For firms with lower innovative content, labor costs – the overall wage level, together with payroll
    and social security contributions – are a more significant obstacle than skills. New evidence suggests
    that after 2007, real wages have increased more than would have been allowed by productivity gains,
    further eroding competitiveness of firms needing to compete on international markets (Trepski and
    others, 2016).
82. Firm responses in the World Bank’s enterprise surveys support the notion that poor economic and
    political governance, together with competition with informal sector and access to finance, are
    major obstacles to business operations. One out of three firms in the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia’s enterprise surveys considered courts systems a major obstacle to business, compared
    with less than one in five in the ECA region as a whole (Figure 19 above). The STEP Employer survey
    also confirms the importance of anti-competitive practices – poor judiciary, informality, etc. – as a
    major deterrent to business and in fact more so for more dynamic firms than for others (Figure 21).
    Distrust in the courts system is widespread in the population at large. The second Life in Transition
    Survey (LITS II) from 2010 showed that while religious institutions, armed forces, policy and the
    financial system are held in comparatively high trust, less than one in five say that they trust the courts
    (compared to one in two in Western Europe). Only one in five believe that the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia’s courts system defends individual rights against the abuse of the state (EBRD,
    2012). More generally, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has improved its standing in
    governance indicators as in other areas of business, economic and political management.
    Nonetheless, the country remains below the global median in government effectiveness and rule of
    law (World Bank, 2012).
83. There is thus a need for progress in deep institutional reforms, and especially the judiciary appears
    to be a critical area for improvement. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has successfully
    improved in different areas of facilitating doing business, but less progress has been seen in reducing

    the costs of importing or exporting, in registering property and in investor protection, and virtually
    none in areas related to insolvency or enforcing contracts. The recovery rate for insolvency is below
    50 percent (compared to 70 percent for OECD countries), the average cost for enforcing contracts is
    about 30 percent of the underlying claim, and it takes almost two years. The inefficiency of the court
    systems reflects slow and long procedures, insufficient impartiality of the judiciary, and poor
    performing courts within Skopje especially, all of which discourages recourse to legal systems
    (UNCTAD, 2011). As seen earlier, not only the costs associated with starting a business, but also those
    incurred during management and – potentially – closure of a firm, matter significantly for how prone
    people are to want to become entrepreneurs.

84. High informality makes for unfair competition and a lack of level playing field in the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia. As shown above, formal sector firms are very concerned about the practices
    of competing firms in the informal sector. In fact, a third of all firms consider informality the most
    important obstacle to doing business, over and above of access to finance and electricity which tend
    to top the list for the average survey country. The preoccupation with informality very likely reflects
    the small size and relatively unsophisticated goods and services of formal enterprises in general in the
    former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, suggesting that they face real competition from the informal
    sector – which in turn, as shown above, is significant in size.
85. Firm characteristics matter for what constraints are most binding. There are different implications
    depending on whether the firms are large or small employers, whether they are based in Skopje or in
    other regions, whether they partake in international trade or receive finance from abroad, and what
    sector they are in (manufacturing, retail, or other). More particularly, large firms (which are not
    necessarily the most productive in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) are less affected by
    all forms of constraints than small and medium sized firms, with the exception of high tax rates. The

    differences between large firms and others are starkest for courts systems, corruption, informality
    and finance, all of which affect business for smaller enterprises considerably.
86. Small, non-exporting firms in the services sector are most exposed to the competition from informal
    sector. A majority of firms in all size categories are de facto exposed to competition from informal
    contenders – as much as 60 percent of foreign-owned, exporting, as well as larger (more than 100
    employees) firms, report facing competition from informal firms. Unsurprisingly, however, the effects
    are strongest felt by smaller service sector firms that cater to domestic markets, of whom nearly 80
    percent deal with informal sector competition in the area. There is also a strong regional dimension,
    as firms in the northwestern and western regions bordering Kosovo*5 and Albania are worst affected
    by informality.
87. Small and medium sized firms are also more concerned by the negative effects of corruption and
    the weak judiciary system and are significantly more credit constrained. Weak governance
    structures, with weak rule of law, political influence in courts, and considerable levels of corruption,
    affect smaller businesses more than others, as they have less resources (human and financial) to
    devote to navigating thorny structures. Unsurprisingly, domestically oriented firms and SMEs are also
    finding more difficulties to access finance.

    4. Going forward: Unfinished business

88. The transition process of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is not complete. Anchored in
    the EU accession process, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has put in place an ambitious
    but challenging reform agenda to foster a more vibrant private sector that can create better jobs for
    its population. Despite these efforts, the economic transition, referring to the move from state-led to
    market-based economic system, is incomplete. Workers have not moved sufficiently into more
    productive and modern activities. There is still high churning (simultaneous gross creation and gross
    destruction) among both jobs and firms. Many adults signal that they would like to become
    entrepreneurs, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a global leader in terms of
    facilitating the start-up of businesses. Yet, net firm creation and firm survival is low. Most formal firms
    remain small with limited capacity to create more jobs and although employment has been increasing,
    the share of formal jobs in total employment has been falling.
89. Productive firms are held back, limiting the potential for the creation of better jobs. Unlike in the
    past, more productive firms created jobs in the formal enterprise sector between 2007 and 2011. A
    small share of these firms (20 percent) are leaders, “gazelles”, that account for a vast majority of new
    jobs. The analysis shows that these firms are young and still small. At the same time, it appears that
    these more productive firms are held back compared to their potential for job creation. In the former
    Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, larger firms are not necessarily more productive. This suggests that
    productive firms are not able to expand as they would in an economic environment more favorable
    to entrepreneurship and private business. What explains this lack of dynamism and how can more
    productive and job creating firms be encouraged?
90. While the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s strong progress on many areas of economic
    reforms must be recognized, there are still significant obstacles present in the business climate. The
    analysis suggests that promoting entrepreneurship, facilitating access to physical and human capital,
    especially credit and the need for a skilled work force, and more broadly improving economic and
    political governance would favor fair competition and productivity growth, and thus job creation and
    economic growth.
91. There is a cause for reviewing how to foster entrepreneurial mind-sets in the former Yugoslav
    Republic of Macedonia, as well as the remaining constraints to starting, running, expanding, and
    closing businesses. The analysis shows that becoming entrepreneurs holds significant appeal for
    many, but that the interest rarely comes to fruition. Potential entrepreneurs factor in both start-up
    costs, success rates and the cost of potential failures, before they venture into new business. While
    start-up is relatively easy in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, other factors, including
    access to credit and the risks of unfair competition, are likely to influence the degree of
    entrepreneurship. It is also possible that the general view of risk taking, and exposure to business
    development, need to increase. It is possible to help develop entrepreneurial mind-sets by including
    this as early as in basic education.
92. Credit is a key factor for success. All over Europe and Central Asia, young firms were slowed down in
    their job creation during the global crisis, where credit crunch together with the trickle down effects
    of the European recession are likely to have played key roles. More dynamic firms, including the




                                                                                                            44
    potential gazelles, may suffer more significantly from credit constraints if they e.g. invest more
    heavily. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has a low level of financial deepening, suggesting
    significant untapped demand for financing. The Government has recently launched a subsidized
    lending program which is target at the micro, small and medium sized firms sector, but with low loan
    ceilings (9,000 Euros maximum). More broadly, there is potential for alleviating structural
    impediments to credit supply by the private financial sector. A particularly promising avenue is to
    work with SMEs to improve accounting practices, to the effect of increasing transparency in terms of
    business management and potential, and reducing the need for collateral including accounting
    practices of SMEs. Evidence from other countries also supports the notion that comprehensive
    entrepreneurship programs, including both finance and training, are more successful in terms of
    business expansion (Cunningham and others, 2010).
93. Skills shortages are a problem for more modern firms. Innovative firms, firms with foreign ownership,
    and firms in services outside the retail sector, consider lack of an appropriately skilled work force a
    major problem in expanding their businesses, and skills shortages are, indeed, a constraint to hiring
    for especially modern and more dynamic firms competing on international markets. Education and
    training policy needs to consider how to equip the population with more, and more relevant, skills. A
    key issue is to involve employers in the skills development system. Their engagement is necessary to
    ensure that relevant skills are taught, that there is a practical content and exposure to the world of
    work, and that information as to areas and competencies in demand flow to students and educators.
    Efforts can focus on strengthening industrial associations and their voice regarding skills and other
    business climate issues, stakeholder representation in the development of curricula and teaching
    methods, and more directly through educational paths that involve firm-based training
    (apprenticeships and internships).
94. Continued international integration will help the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia develop
    a more competitive and successful private sector. The small size of the former Yugoslav Republic of
    Macedonia’s internal market is a limit to the development of competitive industry and services and a
    continued move towards integration in international markets is important. Economic agglomeration
    and critical mass matters for entrepreneurship dynamics as well as for economic production,
    innovation, and other important factors for competitiveness and growth. Where entrepreneurship
    rates are already high, more people become entrepreneurs, holding other aspects, including the
    business climate, constant. There may be a need to focus on helping SMEs increase their integration
    and competitiveness in global value chains, by increasing firm capability, fostering innovation, and
    provide more information on market demand and technologies.
95. A strong message on the importance of improving governance emerges from the analysis.
    Governance areas broadly, and especially courts systems, and corruption, are indeed considered
    significant obstacles to firm expansion in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The long time
    and high cost of entering legal processes, and the impression that political and personal favoritism
    still plays a role, contributes to the lack of trust in courts systems. Small and young firms are more
    severely affected by these constraints. Larger firms have a higher internal capacity and external clout
    to deal with red tape, manage bribes, and wait out results from a slow and unpredictable courts
    system. Addressing this issues involves a deeper reform agenda much beyond investment incentives
    and trade promotion. Institutional strengthening, higher accountability and more transparency, as
    well as judiciary reform should become a priority.
96. Weak institutions are both cause and effect of low formality. Low trust in institutions is causing
    informality, in several ways. Lack of confidence that tax money will be put to efficient use or that




                                                                                                        45
    social security payments will pay off is a disincentive for both employers and workers to formalize.
    Similarly, confidence that legal requirements cannot or will not be enforced and can be circumvented,
    lowers the risk of not formalizing. But conversely, low formality also directly translates into lower tax
    income. Low formality also implies distorted competition, poor resource allocation and lower
    productivity growth, and an economy with a large share of production and employment tied to
    informal jobs is consequently likely to grow slower. Thus, informality potentially undermines reform
    progress through both direct and indirect channels.
97. More analytical work is needed to develop an understanding of how to best promote private sector
    development and job creation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This note not intended
    to provide a full-scale review of the existing policy framework for private sector development, but to
    highlight the kind of analysis that can help further the reform agenda for more and better jobs in the
    private formal sector. Complementary work will be needed to do this, including:
                        Update the analysis with more recent data. Key sources of analysis used in this
                         report date from 2011. Whereas they are likely to represent many of the long-
                         term structural problems afflicting the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
                         analysis of more recent data would help shed light on how private sector
                         employment has responded to phenomena like the economic recovery in EU after
                         2011, more recent economic reforms, and the current political and economic
                         uncertainty in FYR Macedonia.
                        Analysis of effect of social contribution reforms and tax reforms. Inactivity and
                         unemployment can be related to social welfare or labor costs that affect the
                         incentives to enter work or to start a firm. Reforms around social contributions
                         are too recent to be captured by data available to the team, and an analysis of
                         more recent labor force and firm-based data would help shed light on the effects
                         of these policy changes, and for whom.
                        Review of the existing portfolio of active labor market programs (ALMPs) with
                         a view to increasing effectiveness and efficiency. A stocktaking of the existing
                         set of interventions to help foster formal job creation could include a mapping
                         between constraints and programs, analysis of existing evaluations on
                         effectiveness, if any, and a comparison with good practice internationally. This
                         includes programs related to training and skills development, start-up support for
                         entrepreneurs-to-be, as well as job intermediation services. Ways to promote
                         efficiency in skills development, for example by performance based contracting,
                         could be considered, as well as pilot projects to incorporate firm-based learning
                         in especially vocational and technical training.
