Overview

The Kyrgyz economy has remained resilient to the adverse regional environment, but
growth prospects are modest and adjustments needed. While real GDP growth is
expected to remain positive, at above 3 percent in 2016 and 2017, this is lower than
historical performance and the country’s potential. Moreover, economic activity is supported
by an expansionary fiscal stance that cannot be sustained indefinitely, given elevated debt
levels, while private investment has been tepid.

Overall, the macroeconomic situation improved slightly since the shock stemming
from Russia’s recession hit in [late 2014]. The stabilization of the exchange rate—
together with low international prices—have helped dampen inflationary pressures, while
also driving a decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. However, the current account and fiscal
deficits have widened.

In the medium term, growth prospects should improve as remittances and the
external demand environment recover. Higher growth in Russia and Kazakhstan should
drive exports growth (which was negative in the first 10 months of 2016) as well as
remittances inflows, supporting domestic consumption. Moreover, as Kyrgyz producers
gradually adapts to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) norms and standards, they should
gain greater access to the common market.

However, although risks have moderated, they remain elevated. The main sources of
risk relate to possible adverse developments in neighboring economies, principally related
to oil prices and exchange rate dynamics. This implies the need to rebuild fiscal buffers over
the next 2-3 years through a mix of expenditure consolidation and revenue mobilization.
Policy recommendations to increase tax revenues are discussed in the Special Focus Section
of this report.

A.     Recent Economic Developments

Growth in the Kyrgyz Republic remains moderate, yet resilient to a protracted adverse
external environment. Real GDP grew at 2.7 percent in January-October of 2016 (vs. 4.8
percent growth in the same period a year ago), despite a decline in gold production by 3.3
percent (17.1 percent growth in the same period a year ago) (Figure 1). Real output
excluding gold grew at 3.3 percent (4.0 percent growth in the same period a year ago) driven
by higher public spending and increased inflows of remittances that have helped boost
consumption.

Growth has been driven by a relatively solid performance in agriculture, construction
and services. These three sectors grew at 2.2 percent, 7.6 percent and 3.2 percent,
respectively, making the highest contributions to growth in January-October 2016 (Figure
2). Compared to the same period a year ago, this represents a deceleration in agricultural
growth by 4.1 percentage points, higher growth in construction by 1.9 percentage points and
a stable growth in the service sector. At the same time, industry declined by 0.3 percent, as
the gold sector dragged down the 3.1 percent growth rate in non-gold industry.

On the demand side, growth was supported by consumption offsetting negative
contributions from investment and net exports. Backed by increased remittances and
higher government spending, total consumption is estimated to have risen by 2.9 percent in
the first half of the year. At the same time, investment contracted by 9.3 percent, mainly
reflecting the off-loading of inventories. Meanwhile net exports fell by 9.6 percent, largely
led by the collapsing exports, which offset the more modest decline in imports.

Developments in the region, mainly in Russia, continued to affect the macroeconomy.
A slower growth contraction in Russia this year has supported an improvement in
remittances (by around 10 percent over the first 9 months of the year) contributing to
income and consumption growth. While still significantly negative, the trade deficit with
Russia has narrowed slightly, as exports to Russia improved somewhat and imports fell due
to lower world fuel prices.

Slower growth and the absence of exchange rate pressures has led to a decline in
consumer prices. Inflation was estimated at -0.2 percent as of October 2016, down from 3.4
percent in December last year (Figure 3), largely reflecting reductions in food and fuel prices
by 6.1 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively. More generally, the negative inflation resulted
from slow income growth and the stabilization of the exchange rate (Figure 4).

Export performance was weak due to a fall in exports of gold and manufacturing
goods. Total exports in US dollars are estimated to have declined by 15.1 percent in January-
August 2016, with gold exports falling by 28 percent and non-gold exports by 13.4 percent
(Figure 5). While the gold export performance principally reflected a decline in output, the
weak export of manufacturing goods appears to be a result of enhanced standards of quality
control used by the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) member countries (banning goods not
certified by the EEU accredited laboratories) as well as a loss of competitiveness due to the
real appreciation of the som relative to the Kazakh tenge (since July 2015 by 43 percent).
Thus, food and consumer goods exports to Kazakhstan, the largest non-gold export
destination, are estimated to have declined by 28 percent. At the same time, exports of
agricultural products to Russia increased, possibly owing to a substitution of supplies from
Turkey and Poland—countries against which Russia introduced trade sanctions. Reflecting
a good harvest, export of beans to Turkey increased.

Total imports in US dollars are estimated to have fallen by 7.6 percent in January-
August 2016. Imports of food and fuel declined by about 40 percent and 50 percent,

                                                                                            |3
respectively, mainly reflecting lower prices and thus, explaining a fall in total import values
from Russia and Kazakhstan. At the same time, there was an increase in imports of textiles,
clothing and other consumer goods from China, which suggests a rebound of re-export
activity, following contractions in 2014 and 2015.

Overall, the trade balance deteriorated. The trade deficit increased slightly to US$1.74
billion in January-August 2016, from US$1.72 billion a year ago, as both exports and imports
fell with the former declining faster. However, as a share of GDP, the trade deficit increased
more noticeably to 47.2 percent from 42.1 percent on account of slower nominal GDP growth
and the som depreciation over the last 12 months (Figure 6).

However, the current account balance improved slightly, thanks mostly to remittance
inflows. In spite of the wider trade deficit, the current account deficit shrunk somewhat to
17.3 percent of GDP in the first half of this year from 18.2 percent a year before (Figure 6).
This was solely due to increased private transfers, including remittances which grew by
about 10 percent in US dollar terms. The current account deficit was financed by foreign
direct investment, a reduction of financial assets abroad held by residents and public
borrowing. FDI amounted to US$257 million in January-June 2016. The financial assets held
by residents declined by US$213 million and public borrowing amounted to US$135 million.

B.      Economic and Structural Policies
Fiscal policy has been significantly expansionary as the authorities seek to support
economic activity. The budget ran a deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP in January-September
2016, compared to a 0.7 percent surplus in the same period of 2015 (Table 1). This gap

4|
resulted from increased current and capital spending, while total revenues declined just
slightly.

Total revenues amounted to 34.5 percent of GDP, down from 35.4 percent in the same
period a year ago. Tax revenues increased by 1.7 percentage points to 26.5 percent of GDP
as a result of better VAT administration and increased custom revenues. At the same time,
there was a sharp decline in non-tax revenues by 2.8 percentage points to 6.1 percent of GDP,
largely reflecting the high base effect after one-off receipt in 2015. Grant support amounted
to 1.9 percent of GDP, slightly higher than 1.7 percent in the same period a year ago.

Total expenditure surged to 40.5 percent of GDP from 34.7 percent by October,
relative to the same period a year ago. The higher current spending reflects the wage rise
for teachers adopted in September 2015 and increased expenses on goods and services
related to hosting the World Nomad Games and the CIS Summit. On the capital spending side,
the increase stemmed from more intense implementation of the road and energy
infrastructure projects financed by both foreign and domestic sources.

The fiscal deficit was mainly financed by external borrowing and a drawdown of
government deposits. In particular, capital spending was supported through external
borrowing (amounting to 3.2 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2016). The
remaining deficit was funded through a drawdown of government deposits, which declined
by almost 30 percent to 10.6 billion of soms (2.3 percent of GDP). With this, the dollar stock
of external public debt increased, by 4.3 percent during the first 9 months of the year.
However, due to the som appreciation, its ratio to GDP declined to 63 percent from 68.3
percent in December 2015.

A declining inflation trend provided space for loosening the monetary policy through
2016, though this counter-cyclical policy was ineffective. The central bank interest rate
was reduced twice during the first 9 months of the year—to 8 percent (from 10 percent) at
the end of March, and to 6 percent at the end of May. Money supply growth accelerated to
15.2 percent as of September 2016 from 14.9 percent in December 2015 and 10 percent in
September 2015. However, this did not translate into growth of credit to the economy, which
declined by 2.5 percent. This reflected, on the one hand, a subdued demand for loans and, on
the other hand, more cautious lending policies by the commercial banks stemming from
continuing uncertainty.

The monetary policy easing had limited impact on interest rates for loans in the
market. The transmission mechanism has been weak, with an average lending rate declining
only by 2.1 percentage points between December 2015 and September 2016. The
breakdown of interest rate by currency showed a slightly higher decline for loans in foreign
currency (by 1.9 percentage points) compared to som loans (by 1.6 percentage points)
(Figure 7).

The management of the exchange rate was tightened, reducing its flexibility. The
central bank kept intervening in the foreign exchange market. As of October 2016, the central
bank sold US$118 million and bought US$192 million. However, these interventions may


6|
have gone beyond the traditional aim of smoothing fluctuations and kept the exchange rate
artificially stable during April-October. As the main trade partners’ currencies appear to
have weakened over the same period, this has resulted in som’s appreciation in nominal and
real effective terms since April 2016(Figure 8).

C.      Outlook
Growth is expected to be modest over the next two years. Real GDP is projected to
expand moderately at 3.4 in 2016 and 3.1 percent in 2017 with non-gold output growth
projected to grow by 3.9 percent in both years. These projections are based on Kumtor’s gold
production forecasts and growth assumptions for agriculture, non-gold industry, wing a
contraction over the last two years through a stronger export performance and increased
remittances. Growth is also expected to benefit from high government capital spending as in
the previous years.

Inflation is expected to pick up gradually. Estimates suggest that inflation remained low
throughout 2016 (at around 0.6 percent), and will increase to around 4 percent in 2017 as
private consumption demand grows in response to higher remittances. These forecasts
assume no international and food price shocks and exchange rate stability.

Decisive and steadfast fiscal consolidation will be required to ensure macroeconomic
stability and rebuild fiscal buffers. Fiscal policy is quickly running out of space as revenue
growth is limited and public debt is already fairly high—even when partly offset by the
recent currency appreciation. While tax policy and administration reforms could generate


                                                                                                |7
an increase in revenues (as discussed in the Special Focus Section), a major adjustment
should come from reducing spending, in particular expenditures on goods and services.

A shift towards export driven growth is the main challenge. Job opportunities are likely
to open up for Kyrgyz workers in EEU economies—particularly Russia—and, more
generally, the growth model to continue to rely of remittances enabled consumption, the
challenge for the authorities is to press ahead with structural reforms to develop other
sectors of the economy that are labor intensive and offer the most potential for export and
productivity growth.


D.     Special Focus: Tax reform – a pre-requisite to fiscal sustainability
       and service delivery
While fiscal consolidation will necessarily imply expenditure rationalization, a lot can
be achieved by strengthening the revenue effort a pro-growth equitable way.

In turn, tax administration reform is a pre-requisite for success of overall tax reforms.
Eliminating corruption opportunities, making systematic efforts to reduce the informal
economy, and creating a modern administration process based on strong data analytics
using third party information and risk profiling is key.

                               Why is Tax Reform needed?
High development needs require financing and the most sustainable way to finance
required investments is through enhancing domestic resource mobilization. The
Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic estimated required funding at around
355 billion som (around 75 percent of GDP), but only half of the financing sources were
identified. Public debt can hardly be a major source of financing given the already high and
growing debt-to-GDP ratio. Under such circumstances raising tax revenues from the current
20 percent of GDP to higher levels becomes a priority and the main source of funding to cover
investment needs and social programs.

The current tax system relies primarily on indirect taxes and income taxes on
individuals and corporations, but exemptions and special regimes reduce the tax base
and undercut budget revenues. The Kyrgyz Republic collects over 50 percent of its tax
revenue from indirect taxes such as VAT and Turnover Tax, and about a quarter of revenues
from direct taxes. Some of the other taxes bring a very insignificant revenue amount, such as
property tax at 0.5 percent of GDP. There are a number of exemptions and special regimes
for different tax payers in particular in corporate income tax and VAT.

Tax administration is inefficient and imposes an unduly high burden on taxpayers.
The 2017 Doing Business report ranks the country at a low 148th place on the Paying Taxes
indicator, down from 145th in 2016 report. While the total tax rate in Kyrgyz Republic is at
29 percent, lower than ECA average of 33.8 percent and 40.9 percent in OECD high income
countries, the Kyrgyz Republic lags behind all regional comparators on number of payments
(51 payments per year compared to 17.6 in ECA); time to file and pay taxes (225 hours
compared to 221 hours in ECA), time to obtain refund and deal with audits (the post-filing
index1 is at 36.9 compared to 71.9 in ECA and 85,1 in OECD).

There are a number of issues in the performance of the tax administration system. The
use of electronic filing is limited with an e-filing rate of 10.1 percent for CIT, 12.8 percent for
VAT, and 9.7 percent for PIT in 2015. Paper filing increases interaction between taxpayers
and tax officials, and is a potential source of corruption. The absence of risk management
practices and extremely limited access to third party information of the State Tax Service
limits intelligence on tax compliance in the economy. This results in poor tax compliance and
low revenue collection, and creates opportunities for corruption. According to the 2013
Business Environment Enterprise Survey (BEEPs), 54.8 percent of firms reported that they
were expected to give gifts in meetings with tax officials, as compared to 13.4 percent in ECA.
Small companies are disproportionately affected with 59.1 percent reporting the need to pay
bribes.

There is a large informal economy in Kyrgyz Republic complicating tax collection.
Weaknesses in tax administration such as inadequate focus on large-taxpayers, the
resources assigned to assessments of small taxpayers and a focus on minor compliance
matters as well as lack of integrity of taxpayer registration and underdeveloped risk
management throughout registration, filing, payment and audit stages do not allow the

Government to effectively combat informality in the economy. This leads to unfair
competition between legitimate and unregistered companies. In the 2013 BEEPs, around 50
percent of companies reported that they had to compete against unregistered or informal
firms.

Policy gaps and administration issues result in low productivity of the main taxes. The
low tax productivity comes from both policy gap and administration gap (issues with
compliance and the large informal sector). VAT productivity is fairly low (at 39 percent)
compared to the ECA average of 66 percent (Tax at a Glance, 2013). CIT and PIT
productivities are also below regional average at 5 and 9 percent compared to 7 and 16
percent respectively. In addition, the cascading impact of the turnover tax appears to be
damaging to competitiveness of the economy with limited gain in revenue performance.



                             What needs to change in tax policy?
Tax reform is needed to boost domestic revenue mobilization and create fiscal space
for development. Raising tax revenues can include broadening the tax base of personal and
corporate income taxes by eliminating exemptions and special regimes. There is a potential
to increase revenue from all direct taxes, including the property tax which is currently at just
about 0.5 percent of GDP.
Indirect taxation needs to be streamlined. Increasing the VAT rate, which is the lowest in
the region, may be considered. Combined with improved compliance of VAT it could allow
to phase-out the turnover tax, which would simplify administration and ensure a level
playing field for all sectors and companies.

Redesigning the tax policy system may not be effective if ongoing issues in tax
administration are not addressed in tandem. The reduction of exemptions in the VAT
should be accompanied with improved administration. Tax audits, which currently are
mainly ad-hoc can benefit from broader utilization of risk based methods to ensure that
different segments of taxpayers are dealt with according to the risk profiles. In the cases of
the PIT and social security contributions, the pilots on joint administration by the State Tax
Service should be expanded to ensure higher compliance in all wage income taxes. It is also
important that the legal liability towards the social security financing remains separate from
the liability of the personal income tax. This is largely due to significantly different
administration requirements of these forms of payments.

In order for tax administration to ensure a better level of compliance there are several
important pre-requisites:
- Improve the integrity of the taxpayer database through systematic initiatives to detect
    unregistered taxpayers and improved registration and deregistration processes;
- Ensure better access of the State Tax Service (STS) to third party information, including
    banking, and other government agencies (property registers, social security funds) to
    enable effective risk management across key tax administration functions;
- Based on the third party information, improve the targeting of the audit program;
- Improve e-filing rates to allow for better data and ease of compliance by taxpayers;
- Improve tax arrears management functions of the STS.

A better, more efficient use of risk management techniques requires better use of ICT
tools. An ADB project which concluded in 2012 provided a complement of ICT software and
hardware. However, to truly exploit risk-based methods to sharpen enforcement
capabilities, a comprehensive ICT system and data center to collect and mine data from third
party sources on an automatic and regular basis is needed.
