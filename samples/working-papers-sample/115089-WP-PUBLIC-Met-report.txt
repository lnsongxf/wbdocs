From its earliest days, the predecessor of JMA
sought the improvement and expansion of services
to meet evolving and diversifying societal needs
and requirements and to keep pace with scientific
and technical development. The communication
and dissemination tools for the public expanded
from bulletin board, flag, and newspaper to radio
in 1925, and the users of meteorological services
were diversified shortly thereafter to include various
socio-economic sectors, such as shipping and fishery,
aviation, and railway and agriculture.

Box 1.1: Initiation of Meteorological Services and International Cooperation
in the 19th Century

In Japan, meteorological services were initiated in 1875, with a nationwide network of meteorological
observatories and communications by telegram. In those early years, Japan faced almost the same challenges
that developing countries are facing today. The new Japanese government established in 1868 was assisted by
many foreign experts in the drive toward modernization.


In meteorological services, Mr. Erwin Knipping from Prussia (present Germany) joined TMO in 1882 to support
the establishment of the first warning system with weather map. The first weather map and warning were issued
in 1883 (see Figure 1.3), and TMO joined the International Meteorological Organization (predecessor of WMO)
in 1885. His dedicated support for human resources development over the course of 10 years led to self-reliant
services by Japanese experts in 1893, and fostered a spirit of international cooperation.


As modern Japan developed, meteorological services expanded to serve ever-increasing numbers of users. Public
services—weather forecast and notably storm-related disaster countermeasures—have traditionally heavily relied
on the availability of timely and accurate information. Sectors of industry also generated increasing demands.

Surface weather observation data from 22 meteorological observatories were transmitted by telegram
and plotted on the map, and low and high pressures were analyzed in southern and northern Japan,
respectively. The weather bulletin in the upper right of (b) was written by Mr. I. Arai (Surveyor in Chief, TMO)
and Mr. E. Knipping, and bears their signatures. Weather maps and bulletins were issued in both Japanese

Furthermore, JMA carries out various capacity
development activities for NMHSs in developing
countries through the projects implemented by WMO,
the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
and so on (see Chapter 5).


1.4.5 Research and Development,
and Education and Training
Research and development and education and
training are indispensable for the advancement of
meteorological services with state-of-the-art science
and technologies for observation, monitoring, and
forecast. The MRI of JMA is the central and leading
research facility for meteorological services in Japan.
The Meteorological College is a key education and
training institute of JMA that offers courses as a four-
year college as well as various training programs for
JMA technical staff members, and it has contributed
to the development of higher-level human resources
that in turn enabled modernization of meteorological
services in Japan (see Section 2.3.2).


In the area of R&D, JMA through MRI has extensively
collaborated and interacted with the academic
community (research institutes, universities, etc.) to
enhance knowledge, technology, and expertise and to
improve the quality of services. These collaborations
include joint research projects, data exchange (see
Section 3.2.4), and establishment of coordination
mechanisms (see Section 2.1.4).

Box 2.1 Socio-economic Benefits and Meteorological Services in Japan

The benefits of weather and climate services and the impact of weather and climate variabilities are very well
recognized by the general public and also by a wide range of socio-economic sectors, e.g., agriculture, forestry,
fishery, transport, manufacturing and energy, and human health and welfare. Thus the Japanese government,
including JMA, has continuously strengthened its extensive meteorological services, in particular disaster
countermeasures and related services, in response to harsh experiences with severe natural disasters.


The costs of economic damage caused by natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunami, and severe weather and
climate events) are estimated and tabulated by relevant government authorities to facilitate effective measures
for recovery and reconstruction. The estimated annual amount of economic damage is normally several hundred
billion yen (several billion U.S. dollars) but was several trillion yen (tens of billions of U.S. dollars) in 2011 due to the
Great East Japan Earthquake that year. Recently, social damage from heatstroke has increased during the summer;
the number of casualties is tabulated by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency every week to maximize public
awareness about its severity. See also Annex A1.1 concerning climate and natural disasters in Japan.


Japanese society is highly conscious of weather conditions and natural hazards, so there is strong public support
for meteorological services; this support, coupled with substantial societal needs for DRR for protection of life and
property, has resulted in successive strengthening of the extensive meteorological services provided by JMA, the
government, and the mass media (see Chapter 3). Utilization of meteorological data and information by both the
public and industry has also quickly expanded with recent rapid advances in and spread of ICT (see Chapter 4).


Analysis of the socio-economic benefits of improved meteorological services has not necessarily been a direct
driver of those improvements in Japan. The socio-economic benefits of meteorological services have not yet been
well studied quantitatively or comprehensively, and the valuation has been limited to the specific services such as
weather routings of ships and others (see Box 4.3 for specific weather services).

Employment
The JMA professional staff are employed through the national examination for government officials as either:


     • For four-year college courses (around 15); or

     • Graduates with bachelor’s or more advanced degree (mainly in science and technology, such as
       geophysics, physics, ICT, etc.).

Training Courses
The Meteorological College (Photo 2.1) is a JMA education
and training institute offering a four-year college course
and various training programs. The four-year college
course for professional staff provides the highest level of
scientific knowledge in geophysics, including meteorology
and seismology, as well as basic science and technology.
The training programs comprise a number of step-by-step
courses at the Meteorological College as well as at regional
HQs, by correspondence, and through on-the-job training at
respective offices, as schematically illustrated in Figure 2.8.   Photo 2.1: Meteorological College in Kashiwa City.

Box 3.1 Recovery Efforts and Enhancement of AMeDAS Stations after the
2011 Great East Japan Earthquake


The AMeDAS system, with around 1,300 automatic weather stations (AWSs), is
controlled and monitored at the JMA HQ by the centralized system, while LMOs
make regular inspections on site and handle emergency recovery efforts to
resolve malfunctions.


In the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, many weather observations from
AMeDAS stations in northern Japan were suspended due to tsunami damage,
network failure, and power outages. As a result of restoration work by LMOs (see
Photo 3.1 and Figure 3.2), however, 80% of the stations resumed operation within
three days, 90% within a week, and 99% within one month. Two weather radars            After the earthquake, on 23 March 2011
in the region (at Akita and Sendai) also stopped operation immediately after
the earthquake, but both resumed operation by the next day after emergency
inspections.


Furthermore, to enhance weather services for recovery and restoration efforts
by the relevant authorities, a total of nine stations were temporarily set up at the
disaster-stricken vulnerable areas along the northern Pacific coast before the
rainy season.

Box 3.2 Criteria of Risk-based Warning in JMA

Climate and geography vary greatly from region to region. For instance, daily maximum precipitation of around
1,000 mm is frequently recorded in southern Japan during the typhoon and rainy monsoon season, compared to
200 or 300 mm in northern Japan. Consequently, weather-related vulnerability and risk are quite region-specific
and not dependent on the absolute amount of precipitation (the same applies to other weather elements).


In light of the variations in vulnerability and risk by region, JMA has developed municipality-specific criteria for
warnings and advisories, using quantitative thresholds in referring to weather conditions and the past occurrence
of disasters for each municipality. For example:


   1. The soil-water index and run-off index were developed to evaluate potential risks of landslides,
      inundation, and flooding (see Annex A3.6.3), and are used in developing criteria for heavy rain and flood
      warnings (Figure 3.6 on page 38).

   2. Concerning heavy snow, vulnerability and risk associated with climate are quite different for the areas
      along the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. Quantitative criteria for snowfall depth are therefore set
      in comparison with the past damage to traffic and houses.

   3. Given regional difference in climate and geography and the associated countermeasures, including
      breakwaters, in the Pacific Ocean side versus along the Sea of Japan and inland seas, the quantitative
      criteria for wave height and tidal level are set based on past disasters and observed records.

Accordingly, LMOs set the criteria for each municipality in cooperation with the local governments concerned
(see an example in Table 3.1).

In 2013, Typhoon Man-yi (T1318) formed as a tropical depression east of the Mariana Islands at 18 UTC on 11
September. Moving northwestward and gradually turning north-northeastward, the depression developed into
Typhoon Man Yi. It reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 knots and a central pressure
of 960 hPa off the south of Shikoku Island at 12 UTC on 15 September 2013. It made landfall on Japan late on
the same day, and brought catastrophic heavy rains for the Kinki region, including Kyoto, where the two-day
precipitation amounts exceeded two times the monthly average.


The concerned LMOs successively issued bulletins, advisories, and warnings in line with the evolution of extreme
weather conditions; then, just before the landing, they issued a heavy rain emergency warning—the highest
alert for immediate action to protect life (see Figure 3.9 on page 42). As a result, Man-yi caused relatively few
casualties (seven dead/missing) but left over 1,500 destroyed and 10,000 flooded houses.


Following this event, collaboration by the JMA HQ, regional HQs, and LMOs with the relevant authorities in
operational warning services was further enhanced.

Box 3.4 Comprehensive Multi-hazard Approach Following the 2011 Great East
Japan Earthquake


A comprehensive multi-hazard approach was applied immediately after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. In
addition to the daily weather forecast and early warning services for general use, specific services were provided
to the relevant authorities and the public in order to support the rescue and recovery efforts, and to prevent
secondary disasters.


Examples of specific services for the disaster-stricken vulnerable areas are listed below:


     1. User-specific daily and weekly weather forecasts by LMOs for all municipalities, as shown in the left
        and upper-right of Figure 3.14;

     2. Enhancement of tidal information (time series, charts, and tables) due to the significant subsidence
        of land along the Pacific coast of northern Japan, as shown in the lower-right of Figure 3.14; the
        Geospatial Information Authority of Japan reported subsidence of 20 cm to 1.2 m in the areas, and the
        low-lying lands and roads were frequently submerged, as shown in Photo 3.6;

     3. Operation of the portal websites of JMA and specific services to persons in authority through mobile
        phones (portal site in English: http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/en/2011_Earthquake/2011_Earthquake.html);

     4. Modification/adjustment of criteria for issuing warnings and alerts for around 200 municipalities
        where strong earthquake tremors increased vulnerability (e.g., lowering the normal criterion for heavy
        rain warning and Landslide Alert Information by 20–50%); and

     5. Briefing and advice by LMOs to prefectural governments and municipalities in meetings for
        countermeasures and by telephone.

Recovery efforts and enhancement of AMeDAS stations after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake are shown
in Box 3.1.

3.4 Utilization of and User Satisfaction
with Meteorological Services
Every few years since 2002, JMA has conducted an
assessment of the quality of services, including daily
weather forecasts, by analyzing survey questionnaire
responses from the public throughout the country.
These surveys, to which the public could respond
by mail or via JMA’s website, were conducted in
connection with management and planning cycles
described in Sections 2.1.4 and 3.1.1.


The outcomes of the on-line survey conducted in
201411 (with 3,200 responses) are summarized here:


   • The degree of user consciousness/satisfaction
     reaches around 90% for daily forecasts for two
     days and one-week ahead.

   • There is a high degree of dissatisfaction with
     the accuracy/certainty of one-week forecasts.

   • Meteorological services are obtained mostly
     by TV (80%), PC (60%), and mobile phone (35%;
     in this group 50–60% are young people in their
     20s and 30s).12

   • Use of TV has gradually decreased in the
     last decade, but 80% of respondents still
     access weather information this way, even
     with advanced ICT available, while use of PC
     (Internet) and mobile phone (Internet, including
     SNS) exceeds use of conventional newspaper,
     radio, and phone.


11 Assessment report (in Japanese) was issued on 24 March 2015 and is available on the JMA website:
   http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/hyouka/manzokudo/manzokudo-index.htm.
12 Providers of meteorological information to the public are mainly the mass media, information service corporations, and private meteorological
   companies, including authorized forecast service companies, and their services are based on the JMA fundamental data and forecasts.

Box 4.1 Application of Meteorological Information in Power Corporations


In Japan, there are 10 major electric power companies and many medium/small power suppliers from various
industry sectors. Since weather conditions exert a large impact on users’ power demands and the renewable
energy supply, the meteorological and seismic information is crucial for ensuring steady power operation and
supply as part of managing weather-related risks. The Coordination Committee for Power and Weather Services
was established in 1971 among power corporations in cooperation with JMA to exchange technical knowledge
on power and weather for sustainable power supply.


Major power corporations have their own operation systems of power grids that incorporate weather and
earthquake information, which JMA provides among its general services; their specific observation data from
surface weather stations, weather radars, and lightning detection networks; and some weather information from
authorized forecast service companies. The following meteorological information is utilized in decision making by
operators:


  1. Daily and weekly weather forecasts as one of the bases for predicting power demands, i.e., the so-
     called Electricity Forecast: Power demands are largely dependent on weather conditions, especially
     high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter, and appropriate actions are taken for the
     integrated management of power plants and for calling attention to the possible saving at home by the
     public.

  2. Severe weather and earthquake information: Power transmission facilities are vulnerable to severe
     weather, especially damage to power lines by storm, lightning, and snow accretion, and the necessary
     actions are taken for the safety of facilities, such as advance preparation, prevention, and recovery.

  3. Observation and prediction of precipitation amount (rain/snow): Operation of hydroelectric power
     plants at water reservoirs and dams takes precipitation amounts into consideration.

The “Electricity Forecast” by the Tokyo Electric Power Company is available (in Japanese) at http://www.tepco.
co.jp/forecast/index-j.html, which graphically shows the observed and predicted power demands with the
available maximum power supply.


Meteorological services relating to the emerging renewable energy are shown in Box 4.3.

Box 4.2 Application of Meteorological Information by Airline Companies


Weather conditions play a critical role in the safe and steady operation of aircraft by airline companies. JMA
provides specific aviation weather services (i.e., forecasts, warnings, and bulletins on weather conditions) to CAB,
airline companies, and individual cruising aircraft under the international frameworks of ICAO and WMO, as shown
in Section 3.3.


JMA weather information is duly incorporated into the aircraft operation systems of major airline companies
(see Figure 4.5), especially NWP products, Himawari-8 imagery, Doppler radar data, and lightning monitoring
information, as well as aviation-specific observation data at aviation weather offices. Weather information is
effectively utilized in the following decision-making support for operators under the control of CAB:


  1. In-flight services: Information on hazardous weather conditions is used to ensure safety of flight during
     take-off and landing (strong crosswinds and severe wind shear), at cruising altitudes (turbulence), and
     for optimum routing.

  2. Planning and preparation of each flight: The latest observations and forecasts are used during the
     flight to ensure flight safety and confirm the flight route and schedule.

  3. Planning and management of daily operation of all flights within a day: The latest observations and
     forecasts are used to alter flight schedules and cancel flights.

  4. Risk management of flight operation plan for two to five days ahead: Medium-range predictions of
     severe weather (such as typhoon, hurricane, heavy snows, and developed lows) are used to alter flight
     schedules and cancel flights.

Weather routing services to specific ships/aircraft:
Ships and aircraft benefit not only from navigation safety, but also from lower fuel consumption and shorter travel
times over optimal routes, made possible by local- to global-scale analyses and predictions of weather conditions,
marine meteorological and oceanic conditions (for ships), and winds and their turbulences in the upper air (for
aircraft).


Weather services for public works and transport/distribution sector:
Transport and management of roads (highways) and railways are strongly affected by wind, rain, snow, ice, and
fog, and transport management corporations usually have the safety systems to make observations themselves
and to collect weather forecasts from authorized forecast service companies. Information along routes allows
managers to decide on closure, cancellation, speed control, clearing of snow, prevention of icing, etc., to ensure
safety around the clock.


Weather and marine meteorological conditions around ports and harbors are strongly dependent upon, and varied
by, geographical features, and specific services on winds, waves, and tides are provided to the management
authorities by private meteorological companies.


Weather merchandising:
Sales of necessaries of daily life depend on weather conditions (e.g., temperature and rain), and weather forecast
services by private companies are provided to retail trading and distribution businesses to allow efficient stock
management, disposal of unsold products, etc.


Weathercasters/reporters on TV/radio programs:
The mass media information service corporations, including Internet providers, authorized forecast service
companies, security companies, and others, provide a wide range of weather services (such as weather
forecasts) for selected fixed locations and routes, and information coupled with daily life and security, through
interactive ways.

Box 4.3 Typical Private Meteorological Services (continued)



Weather services through the Internet, mobile apps, and SNS:
The mass media information service corporations, including Internet providers, authorized forecast service
companies, security companies, and others, provide a wide range of weather services (such as weather
forecasts) for selected fixed locations and routes, and information coupled with daily life and security, through
interactive ways.


Weather services for security and risk management:
Information on severe weather and earthquakes is provided to corporations for their business continuity planning,
sometimes in support of mapping of risks and conditions using the GIS.


Services for management of power supply:
Activities in major power supply corporations are shown in Box 4.1 in detail. The user requirements for weather
information have gradually been enhanced in light of the recent expansion of renewable (wind and solar) energy
supplies, which are significantly affected by weather conditions. Wind and sunshine information is provided by
authorized forecast service companies to power supply corporations for their analysis and application, especially
for prediction of generating power and operation of windmills.


Other specific user groups:
In addition to the above-mentioned services, tailored weather forecasts are provided by authorized forecast
service companies to the following user groups (industry sectors and the public; users’ primary concerns are
shown in parentheses):


     1. Manufacturing industry (lightning and earthquake);

     2. Leisure industry, e.g., golf courses (lightning), marine leisure (ocean waves and wind), amusement
        parks (rain and temperature), and baseball/football stadiums (rain);

     3. Daily life and leisure of individuals (rain and temperature), outings (rain), and mountain-climbing (rain
        and lightning).

Note: Recently, groups using JMBSC dissemination services have expanded into various industry sectors other than authorized forecast service
companies, as shown in Figure 4.3, which means that they have developed their own systems to utilize meteorological information by themselves
(e.g., corporations related to information networks, ICT manufacturing, security, power supply, etc.).

of JMA services described in Chapter 3 have
contributed to the planning and implementation of the

projects implemented by JMBSC have been achieved
through the following:


     1. Proper survey by experienced experts to
        identify the real requirements of the recipient
        NMHS, and suitable medium- and long-term
        design of projects tailored to recipient’s
        needs, available resources, and other relevant
        circumstances;

     2. Full understanding of the project’s purpose,
        objectives, and expected outcomes on the
        part of the NMHS executive management,
        focal points, and staff, in order to ensure
        effective project design and implementation;
        and their continued involvement in all the
        implementation phases;

Concluding Notes
Developed countries, donors, and international
organizations should support and coordinate the
following in order to enhance capacities and facilitate
modernization in developing countries:


 1. Developing countries themselves should
    develop and establish well-defined medium-
    and long-term strategic planning and
    management for sustainability, which should
    include the development, operation, and
    maintenance of observation, monitoring, and
    forecast systems and the improvement of
    service delivery to user communities (with
    reference to Recommendations 1–9);

 2. International supports by several donors
    should be provided based on the NMHS’s
    consolidated long-term strategic plan and
    management, and well-organized institutional
    collaboration/coordination mechanisms
    should be established among donors and
    international organizations, under the NMHSs’
    leadership;

 3. Supporting targets in each developing country
    should be prioritized based on the current
    status of systems and services, including
    human resources, and on the status of societal
    foundations; and

 4. Societal foundations/infrastructure, including
    power and ICT networks, should be improved.

        countries to facilitate their advanced early
        warning services; and

     c) Systematically transfer the state-of-the-art
        techniques on analyses of severe weather
        and climate events.

The support should be designed and implemented
through accurate assessment of the situation
of and requirements for planning; deployment of
HimawariCast systems; trainings of forecasters;
and follow-up programs for sustainable operational
services.

Closing Remarks


This review was conducted in the context of the
Japan–World Bank Program for Mainstreaming
Disaster Risk Management in Developing Countries.
Japanese knowledge, technology, and expertise
assessed through this review will significantly
contribute to the modernization of NMHSs in
developing countries, in particular in terms of systems,
operations, and human resources development, as well
as to World Bank operations. It is recommended that
all the interested parties should draw on the experience
of and/or closely collaborate with JMA in the process
of modernizing operational weather, climate, ocean-
related, and terrestrial services, especially in the Asia-
Pacific region, through long-term sustainable efforts.


For sustainable development of effective early warning
services by NMHSs in developing countries, it should
be emphasized that better-performing observation,
forecast, and warning services are acquired not
only through modernizing operational systems with
enhanced technical knowledge and skills; they also
require strengthening user engagement and fostering
a culture within NMHSs for quality assurance, data
archiving, and compliance.

Many current operational observation and information
systems have reached the most advanced stage ever
(4th modernization stage, see Section 1.2) through
the medium-/long-term planning for replacement/
upgrading, as described below.


A3.1.1 Computer System for Meteorological
Services (COSMETS) and NWP Models
High-performance telecommunication and data
processing systems are essential for successful
early warning services. JMA operates two major
computer systems: one, the Automated Data Editing
and Switching System (ADESS), is the center of the
communication network for all data and products,
including international data exchange; and the other,

As one of the pioneers among NWP centers, JMA has         Figure A3.1.3: Observation Sites of AMeDAS
continued active development and enhancement of           (around 1,300 Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs))
a suite of NWP systems since the commencement
of operational numerical prediction in 1959 (see
Annex A3.4). The computer system NAPS has been
replaced by the latest system every five to six years
(Figure A3.1.1), and the current ninth-generation
system is composed of NWP models at the local scale
covering Japan (2-km resolution) and at the global
scale (20-km resolution) with nine-hour and 11-day-
ahead predictions, respectively. In addition to weather
prediction, the models cover climate prediction for
seven months ahead, El Niño and oceanic currents,
storm surges and sea conditions, atmospheric
environment (UV-B, Aeolian dusts, and hazardous
materials), and volcanic ashes.


A3.1.2 Automated Meteorological Data
Acquisition System (AMeDAS)
The AMeDAS system shown in Figure A3.1.3 is a
nationwide observation network of more than 1,300
automatic weather stations (AWSs) established in
1974, more than 40 years ago. The concept of AMeDAS
was quite innovative; with successful observation rates
of 99.7–99.9%, it targeted the 4th modernization stage
from the beginning. Although the first system was
based on analogue public telephone circuits, all the
hourly observation data were collected automatically
within eight minutes. After several system upgrades/
replacements, the latest system collects all the data
from representative stations every one minute and
delivers the information to users within 40 seconds.

Downpours was initiated to issue an alert when a

public as warnings on a real-time basis (e.g., display    established at the Osaka Regional HQ in 1954. By 1971,
on TV screen).                                            radar service areas had been expanded to cover all
                                                          of Japan. In the early days, radar observations were

• Tsunami heights may exceed estimations due to coastal topography and other factors in some regions.
  Evacuate to higher ground.
• Tsunami Forecasts (Slight Sea Level Change) are issued if the estimated tsunami height is less than 20 cm
