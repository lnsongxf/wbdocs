KEY MESSAGES:

In the short term, the Adaptation Protocol (AP) of the SAA will result in tariff revenue losses for BiH and
may place additional pressure on some sectors. The World Bank carried out a trade analysis to identify
potential effects of this AP on the imports from the EU on consumption and local production of agricultural
and food products. The maximum tariff revenue loss for agriculture and food imports from the EU-28 was
estimated to range between BAM 51 and 68 million annually, based on available production and trade
data. This estimate provides a partial perspective on the trade flows; technology changes, as well as
consumer benefits of reduced prices can offset these short term effects.

Trade liberalization has been ongoing for a decade in BiH, as in other countries in the region, and will
continue to influence trade flows. In June 2008 an Interim Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA)
on trade and trade-related issues enters into force. On February 1st 2017, the Adaptation Protocol (AP)
adapting the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between BiH and the EU provisionally entered
into force. The SAA AP affects 8 percent of BiH’s agriculture and food imports from EU-27 and Croatia.
The majority of agricultural and food imports from the EU-27 and Croatia have already been liberalized.

Improving the competitiveness of the agri-food sector in BiH is a good proposition in a transforming
environment. This is a process that can be built around three key areas: (i) investments in the productive
and entrepreneurial capacity of agricultural producers, linking them to markets and building their
comparative advantages; (ii) investments in an integrated information system for decision making, where
both compliance mechanisms (food safety measures, registries, etc.) to EU accession and other
information (prices of important products, weather data, extension services, etc.) can build resilience and
improve the capacity to respond to trade and climate pressures of small producers, hence making them
more competitive in a rapidly changing agro-ecological and socio-politic environment; (iii) strengthening
the capacity of the Government to provide an enabling environment for these investments to have
impact.

Background on the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) and the Adaptation
Protocol (AP)

Trade relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and the European Union (EU) are governed by
the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina
- a key step towards EU accession –provides the formal mechanisms and timelines to bring BiH closer to
EU standards, supporting movement towards eventual EU accession. Full and effective implementation
of the SAA is required for any further assessment by the EU of the country’s accession prospects. The
entry into force of the SAA, and its effective implementation, provides a positive signal of progress
towards EU accession. As such it can increase the confidence of investors, domestic and international in
the country. A key element of the SAA is the liberalization of bilateral trade, which was already put in
place with the entry into force in June 2008 of the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related issues,

On February 1st 2017, the Adaptation Protocol (AP) adapting the Stabilization and Association
Agreement between BiH and the EU provisionally entered into force. BiH had been required to adapt
the SAA after Croatia became an EU member in July 20132. Croatia, along with BiH, was a member of the
Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), but was obligated to leave CEFTA upon its accession to
the EU. As a result, the EU demanded that the concessions between the two sides be adjusted according
to the trade flows that existed between BiH and Croatia prior to the accession of Croatia to the EU. The
BiH authorities refused to do so out of concerns about the impact that this would have on the country's
agricultural sector. Subsequently, the EU suspended BiH’s preferential trade arrangements (Autonomous
Trade Measures, ATM3) as of January 1, 2016. In 2016 the adaptation of the SAA, through the
implementation of the AP, was made a crucial condition of BiH's EU membership application process. On
July 18th 2016, BiH agreed to adapt the SAA to take into account bilateral trade with Croatia. On September
9th, the BiH government adopted a protocol on adjusting the SAA, which was signed in December 2016.

The new AP provides preferential market access for both, EU agricultural and food products into BiH
and BiH agricultural and food products into the EU market. This market access reflects trade preferences
and trade flows that existed between BiH and Croatia under CEFTA. Under the terms of the new AP,
agricultural and food producers from BiH benefit from access to the EU through the increase of relevant
quotas for exports of wine, sugar and fish. EU agricultural and food producers will have market access to
BiH through the creation of tariff rate-quotas (TRQs) for a number of products.

Study Objectives and Limitations

The objective of this note is to provide insights into the potential effect of the AP on imports of EU
agricultural, food and fisheries products into BiH. We adapt and calibrate the Tariff Reform Impact

  In connection with Croatia’s EU accession, the EU negotiated and signed adaptations to all its existing trade
agreements with third countries, including BiH.

  The EU’s “autonomous trade measures” (ATM ) grant exceptional and unlimited duty-free access to the EU market
for almost all agricultural and processed food products originating in the Western Balkan countries. Between 2000
and 2016, ATM allowed BiH exporters to also be exempt from EU specific duties on imports of fresh fruits and
vegetables related to the so-called entry price system which aims at stabilizing the EU market by preventing the price
levels in non-EU countries from having repercussions on prices within the EU. ATM was reintroduced in relation to
BiH on February 1, 2017 and will remain in force in relation to all Western Balkan countries until 2020.

Simulation Tool (TRIST)4, a partial equilibrium trade model developed by the World Bank, to estimate the
impact of imports from the EU on consumption and local production of agricultural and food products for
which disaggregated data is available. The impact of a change in tariffs is modeled in a simple partial
equilibrium trade model with imperfect substitution between imports from different trading partners and
domestic production. The team benefitted from the cooperation with the counterparts (MOFTER and
Ministries) regarding data and inputs.

This analysis has important limitations and the results should be considered as indicative estimates.
This is a trade analysis that only partially reflects the overall impact and provides a very short term
perspective on trade interactions. TIRST is a static model that depends on the availability of disaggregated
agricultural data on both imports and production. The following aspects need to be kept in mind when
drawing conclusions from this report:
     The model does not take into account the impact of EU enhanced market access on BH exports;
     The model does not estimate the potential impact of non-tariff barriers that may exist;
     The model only considers products for which there is correspondence between production and
         import data, which was not the case for some products (e.g. processed food) and these were not
         considered in the analysis;
     The model estimates rely on trade data available until 2015 and FAO production data available
         until 2013; data for 2016 was not available at the time the analysis was carried out;
     The model provides estimates of direct revenue losses connected to the tariff; no indirect loss
         related to the value of the liberalized import is estimated;
     The model does not consider changes in technology, which can influence productivity and hence
         production volumes.

Descriptive analysis

Total BiH’s agricultural imports have been relatively stable from 2011 to 2015. The EU-27, CEFTA and
Croatia are three major trading partners with BiH, together accounting for over 80 percent of BiH’s
agricultural imports (Figure 1). Beverages, cereal and animal products dominate BiH’s imports from its
major trading partners, as shown in table A1 of the Appendix. The SAA AP affects 8 percent of BiH’s
agriculture and food imports from EU-27 and Croatia. To estimate the share of imports from the EU and
Croatia that will be affected by the implementation SAA AP, we focus on BiH imports in 2015, the last year
with available imports data. Figure2 shows that the majority of agricultural and food imports from the EU-
27 and Croatia have already been liberalized.5 Imports that will be partially liberalized in 2017 under the
new TRQs have a total value of just under BAM 120 million of equivalent 2015 imports.

  Article 34.1 of the SAA states: “From the date of entry into force of this Agreement, no new customs duties on
imports or exports or charges having equivalent effect shall be introduced, nor shall those already applied be
increased, in trade between the Community and Bosnia and Herzegovina”. Annex III of the SAA has five sections,
each one describing a modality for tariff reduction from the date of entry into force of the Agreement, including
Annex III(f) that was introduced by the Adaptation Protocol.

Tariff levels on imports into BiH from EU-27 and Croatia differ greatly across product groups. Figure 3
shows the domestic production for different products, the imports of these products from Croatia and
EU-27, as well as the weighted average these imports were confronted before and after the entry into
force of the SAA AP.6 Most categories have tariffs close to zero once the SAA AP is in force, except for
chicken and a lower extent for potatoes, grapes and milk. Chicken meat has the highest protection level
equal to an ad valorem equivalent (AVE) rate of over 200 percent, mainly because the relative high-specific

tariffs included in its compound tariffs.7 As a consequence, EU-27 imports are relatively small compared
to domestic production. It is worth mentioning that the AVE of compound tariffs varies in time if there are
changes in the unit price of the trade good. Some products of Croatian origin are likely to be liberalized
by the SAA AP, such as potatoes and milk.

Data constraints limited the extent of the modelling exercise, and in particular, the impact assessment
on domestic production. Production data was taken from the FAO, which was only available for some
primary and fresh food products until 2013. We were able to simulate the impact of the SAA AP only on
categories that had data on production. Yet, as shown in Figure 4, most of imports are not affected by
the SAA AP either because they have been already liberalized by Jan 2017 or because the SAA regime does
not specify yet a change in the tariff regime. Figure 4Figure shows the amount of EU imports that have
not been liberalized (in green). Among imports having a change in tariffs or subject to SAA (grey bars in
Figure 2), Figure 4 differentiates products for which no production data is available (blue bars) from
products with FAO production data (orange bars).

 Compound tariffs have two components: (i) an ad valorem tariff that is calculated as a percentage of the value of
the product, and (ii) a specific tariff expressed as monetary terms per physical unit of the good being imported.

TRIST Model and Simulation Strategy

The Tariff Reform Impact Simulation Tool (TRIST), a partial equilibrium model, is used to estimate the
effects of SAA AP adoption on imports and domestic production in BH. The World Bank has developed
TRIST, a simulation tool that can be used by policy makers in client countries to analyze the
adjustment implications of trade reform. When appropriate data are available, it can provide
information on the short-term relative vulnerability of different sectors in the domestic economy in
terms of output and employment.8 The tool was developed to provide better estimates of the impact
of changes in tariffs on government revenues, imports, protection and prices. It is flexible and can
incorporate tariff liberalization scenarios involving any group of trading partners and any schedules of
products, it runs in Excel, with formulas and calculation steps visible to the user; and is open-source and
users are free to change, extend, or improve according to their needs.9

The trade model in TRIST is a partial equilibrium model that treats demand for each product in isolation
from the rest of the economy. Hence, it does not take into account inter- and intra-sectoral linkages or
the economy wide impacts of tariff changes. But this is not the primary objective of TRIST, which is
designed so as to avoid the degree of aggregation of the data that would be necessary in order to
implement economy wide computable equilibrium models and to remain simple and transparent in its

8
  It can also be linked to household budget data to trace the influence of changes in prices following trade reform to
household expenditures and the costs of attaining the given consumption bundle

assumptions, with the flexibility to adjust the key parameters. Thus, TRIST has been designed with the
specific task of providing policy makers with important insights into the short-term effects of trade reform.
It has not been designed for making longer-term predictions about the broad economy wide impact of
trade reform. Indeed, no long term effects are estimated, such as growth and reallocation of production
factors such as capital and labor. By its comparative static nature TRIST allows the comparison of two
states - one in which the base values of policy instruments (such as tariffs) are unchanged and another in
which these base values are exogenously changed. Thus no dynamic effects are considered.

TRIST involves three stages to determine the impact of imports and production following a change in
trade policy (Figure 5). In the first stage, TRIST allocates expenditure on imports of a product across
different country suppliers. The allocation changes when tariffs and duties are amended10. The extent
to which a given change in relative prices translates into a change in relative imports depends on a
user-defined importers substitution elasticity. In order to isolate the importers substitution effect,
total imports are held constant in this step. In the second step, total expenditure on a given product
is allocated between domestic sources and imports. The domestic substitution effect allows for a
demand shift between domestic production and imports when the relative price of imports changes.
The extent to which the share of imports in domestic consumption changes depends on a user
defined domestic substitution elasticity. The change in imports is then distributed across all importers
according to their share of the import market. This calculation step can only be modeled if data on
domestic production is available. Finally, the third step allows for an overall demand effect in
response to the change in the average price of domestic consumption of the good. The average price
change is computed as an average of the price change in imports and the price change in domestic
production, weighted by their relative shares in domestic consumption. A decrease/increase in the
average price of the product leads to a percentage increase/decrease in overall consumption of the
product, proportionately distributed between imports and domestic production. The extent to which
imports change for a given change in the overall price depends on a user-defined import demand
elasticity.11




10
   The exporter substitution effect defines how imports from exporter A are substituted for imports from exporter B
when the price of imports from exporter A relative to B declines, for example following a preferential trade reform
that includes exporter A but not exporter B.
11
   Elasticities are crucial parameters of the model that are difficult to estimate and so detailed and robust estimates
of the three elasticities (importers substitution, domestic substitution, demand) are not readily available in the
literature. TRIST includes sensible default values for each of these three parameters that are common across
products and import suppliers. The sensitivity of the results can be easily assessed by changing the values of the
elasticities. When detailed local knowledge on these elasticities is available, TRIST allows users to define trading
partner and product specific elasticities. Furthermore, there is an option to include the most well-known estimates
of elasticities in the literature. First, the user can choose to incorporate the import demand elasticities estimated in
Kee et al (2005). However, these elasticities are not available for all product groups (HS 6 digit). In addition, the user
can choose to use the product specific import demand elasticities used in SMART. For exporter substitution
elasticities or domestic substitution elasticities there are no estimates available at the level of product detail that
TRIST uses.

A synthetic baseline scenario is constructed to take account of events between 2013 and 2016 and
address other data constraints. TRIST is a static model that is calibrated in a baseline scenario and once
the trade policy variables are shocked, it would estimate the new post-shock scenario. Ideally, we would
have liked to obtain trade and production data for 2016 to estimate the effect of the SAA AP implemented
in February 2017. Yet, FAO production data is only available until 2013 and trade data until 2015. In
addition, other events need to be considered to construct a baseline scenario. First, Croatia joined the EU
in July 2013 and BH imposed quotas on their imports from this country after that. Second, the floods in
May 2014 and the drought of the summer 2015 caused losses to agriculture production in BH.

Figure 6 describes the simulation strategy step-by-step. First, we calibrate the model using average
2011/12 values for production, trade flows and trade policy data (tariffs and TRQs), which mimics a
scenario where there are no natural disasters affecting domestic production. Then, we apply a policy
chock by setting all BIH tariffs and TRQs on imports from the EU-27 and Croatia to the levels of January
2017, just before the entry into force of the SAA AP. The simulated trade flows and production levels
constitute what we call the synthetic baseline scenario. Finally, we shock the model by changing tariffs
and TRQs on imports from the EU to the levels of February 2017, after the SAA AP enters into force, which
would simulate the production and imports levels after the SAA AP.

Results

FAOSTAT production data allowed simulations only for 8 product groups and only products with large,
non-binding quotas in the TRQs are expected to have higher imports and lower production for local
market. To estimate whether a TRQ will be binding once the SAA AP is implemented, we used 2015 import
data (the last year with available import data) and checked whether the same TRQ will be binding if
applied in 2015. The underlying assumption is that the demand for imports from the EU-27 and Croatia in
2017 onwards will be at least as big as in 2015.

SAA AP was found to affect only local production of poultry and honey12 and no adverse effect on local
production was found for the following: (i) potatoes; (ii) cabbages and other brassicas; (iii) carrots and
turnips; (iv) sour cherries; (v) grapes, and (vi) whole, fresh cow milk. The quotas of TRQs applied to these
products under the SAA AP will become binding. Thus, only the first units before reaching the quota enter
the BiH market duty-free, and imports beyond the quota enter the BiH paying the MFN tariff that was
prevalent in these imports before the implementation of the SAA AP. Thus, there is no actual change on
imports and production as the constraining TRQs shelter these products from EU competition. The only
change is a loss of tariff revenue for the first units and the rent may be distributed between traders and
consumers. As explained before, the choice of elasticities is fundamental on the magnitude of results. We
run a few simulations using different vectors of elasticities.

Simulation results when using high elasticities for substitution between imports and for domestic-foreign
substitution, drawn from the GTAP model13, suggest an increase in the negative effect on domestic
producers as local production of poultry and honey falls by 1.2 M BAM and 0.2 M BAM respectively (Figure
7). These simulations can be considered as an extreme unfavorable case scenario for BiH producers.
Consumer welfare increases following the reduction of tariffs on EU products, because they reduce local
prices; consumer welfare gains are likely to offsets tariff revenue loss plus producers’ welfare loss in the
model. Simulations do not take into account the effects on BiH exports to the EU due to enhanced marked
access under the SAA AP that could also increase revenue for local producers exporting to the EU.

   Honey production is 1.4 percent of the value of agriculture production recorded by FAO, whereas poultry
production is 5.2 percent. Also, import volumes of honey and poultry by BH are quite significant (more than 200 tons
of honey and above 14,000 tons of poultry in 2013), which implies that domestic producers are already facing
external competition. Furthermore, productivity of the poultry sector is higher than in neighboring countries, which
indicates existent capacity to respond to competition.

   The standard GTAP Model is a multiregional, multisector, computable general equilibrium model, with perfect
competition and constant returns to scale that is also a source of data on elasticities. For reference, see:

Upon effectiveness of the SAA AP, the maximum tariff revenue loss estimated for agriculture and food
imports from the EU-28 can be expected to range between BAM 51 and 68 million annually.14 There are
many products for which the TRQs of the SAA AP will become binding, thereby import levels, and thus
local production, are not affected. Yet the first imported units before quotas become binding do not pay
tariffs and provoke a tariff-revenue loss for the government, while imports beyond quota will pay the
most favored nation (MFN) tariff. The estimates focus on the HS tariff lines that will experience changes
in TRQs following the adoption of the SAA AP and that are likely to become binding. Thus, the “maximum
revenue loss” is estimated assuming that TRQs will be binding once the SAA AP is implemented, assuming
the demand will be larger than the quota. Figure 8 reports our estimates of the maximum tariff revenue
loss for different categories of products. The yearly variation follows the TRQ schedules that tend to
increase quota levels.

Despite the data limitations, the results from the modelling exercise imply that some agricultural
producers might be adversely affected by the SAA AP in the short term. However, at the aggregate, tariff
revenue losses estimated under this exercise need to be weighed against other structural factors of the
BH’s agricultural sector that influence the magnitude of SAA impacts. Challenges with the existing farm
structure, institutional and regulatory reforms that have not yet been fully aligned with EU requirements
to allow for free flow of goods to the EU, as well as difficulties in accessing credit and capital by farmers,
food safety considerations, as well a technology packages to improve productivity, remain and continue
to inhibit the development of a more competitive agricultural sector in BH.




14
  The contribution of the agriculture sector to BH GDP is about 7 percent in 2014, accounting for BAM 1,840 million.
Thus the revenue loss is about 3 percent of the latter figure.

                                                                              10
Looking forward

Measuring the impact of tariff changes provides a partial view of the larger issues in the performance of
the agricultural sector. Among the potential entry points for strengthening the sector’s performance vis-
à-vis trade (and other) shocks are:

1. Improving the performance of the domestic agri-food producers and adding value to agricultural
   production. This would require actions at the policy level, as well as at the producer level, such as: i)
   Alignment of existing regulatory frameworks on food safety to EU requirements, access to financial
   support, etc.; ii) Ability to differentiate between targeting support that has social objectives (providing
   income support) from measures supporting investments that foster the modernization and
   competitiveness of the sector; iii) Building the resilience of the sector to weather and price shocks,
   hence smoothing production cycles. There are both financial and climate-smart production measures
   that could be taken to manage risk, while improving productivity, mitigating vulnerabilities and
   improving longer term competitiveness through modernization of systems.

2. Strengthening institutions. BH still suffers from a fragmented and unclear institutional and regulatory
   set up that needs harmonizing to ensure that policies, regulations and enforcement work as a single
   unified system. This is particularly so as it relates to food safety in line with EU requirements that
   point towards the need for clear mandates and responsibilities between all the public actors. While
   considerable efforts were made in trying to harmonize these aspects with amendments to legislation
   at State and Entity level over the last couple of years, implementation on the ground of some of these
   aspects remains pending.

3. Leveraging resources. Some of the tariff revenue loses can be mitigated by attracting alternative
   funds for the development of the agri-food sector. These resources may come in the form of grants
   to the government or could be mobilized with the donor community or IFIs. In order to optimize their
   impact at producer level, such financial assistance would need to be delivered in time with yearly
   programing and seasonal cycles, be selective and simple in terms of the type of support given with
   minimum administrative costs and a maximization absorption by beneficiaries. For that to happen all
   government structures and stakeholders need understand their role in making the support system
   work. A Rural Development Strategy with a blue print of the paying structure for the country would
   provide the guidance for setting up such an efficient administrative system to transparently guide
   such investments down to the producer/farm level.

4. Effective management of a support program depends on effective agricultural information system.
   While significant effort shave been made in developing databases and information systems under
   various donor funded programs, these systems remain incomplete or are hampered by institutional
   hurdles that prevent broad based information sharing within country or with the exterior. EU
   accession requires a high degree of agriculture related information that forms the basis for policy
   making. In converging towards more EU compliant support programs such as area based payments,
   a number of existing data bases such as the farm and livestock register need integration with the Land
   Parcel and Identification system that then ties into the IACS that will provide the basis for more
   accurate sector impact analysis and better policy targeting at all administrative levels of BiH.
