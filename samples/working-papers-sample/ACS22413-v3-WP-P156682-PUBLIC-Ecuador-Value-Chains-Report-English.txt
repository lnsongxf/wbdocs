I. INTRODUCTION

1. Increasing competitiveness and economic diversification are critical priorities for
achieving growth and structural transformation in Ecuador. A deceleration of
productivity growth, coupled with heavy reliance on the exploitation of natural resources
and stagnating export diversification have resulted in lower competitiveness in Ecuador
in recent years. This loss in competitiveness is exacerbated by falling oil prices and
appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The confluence of these factors has resulted in fiscal
constraints for the government and make the improvement of productivity and
diversifying the product basket even more urgent (World Bank Group, 2016).

2. While productivity and diversification have been consistent policy priorities in
recent years, economic conditions have worsened overall in Ecuador. Significant
efforts have been made by the Government of Ecuador and its partners to prepare a policy
framework and agenda around diversification, or more popularly, the “transformation of
the productive matrix”. In 2010, the Coordinating Ministry of Production, Employment
and Competitiveness (MCPEC) led the preparation of “Productive Territorial
Transformation Agendas”, which aimed, inter alia, to improve productivity, the quality
of national production, and to diversify products and services with increased value added,
in particular for export. Then in 2014, the Vice-President’s Office published the flagship
report called the “National Strategy for the Change of the Productive Matrix”, which can
be seen as the seminal policy statement and vision for economic diversification during
the second term of President Correa. In 2015, the Government of Ecuador hired Bain &
Company to undertake a consultancy entitled “Ecuador Productivo 2025”, which
analyzed productive chains in agricultural, agro-forestry, fishing industries and
intermediate Industries and presented investment strategies for their growth. Finally, in
2014, the Economic Commission for Latin America and Caribbean (ECLAC) undertook
studies on the tourism, software, cocoa, shrimp, capital goods, medicine for human
consumption and solid waste value chains for the Vice-President’s Office.

3. This report presents the technical assistance provided to the Ministry of Industry
and Productivity (MIPRO) over the course of 2016 to prioritize value chains and
clusters in an effort to improve productivity and increase domestic value-added.
This non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) implemented one of the areas
recommended for technical assistance in the 2015 World Bank Group Technical Note
“Fostering productivity for Export and Growth”, (World Bank Group, 2015) and builds
on previous work undertaken by the World Bank Group in Ecuador on the themes of
productivity, innovation and diversification. As such, the primary audience for this report
is MIPRO. The report moves further beyond reporting on the technical assistance for the
prioritization of value chains and provides: (i) an overview of the framework and
methodology for Competitive Reinforcement Initiatives (CRIs), including selected
analytical tools; (ii) a preliminary strategic analysis of the coffee, cocoa, fish and wood
products industries; (iii) a discussion on the linkages between diversification,
productivity, innovation and agricultural value chains; and, (iv) a presentation of Cluster
Development Programs (CDPs) including their effects on productivity.

4. While further improvements in Ecuador’s business climate are indeed necessary,
this paper argues in favor of CDPs as an avenue for achieving improved
competitiveness and productivity. From a regulatory policy point of view, Ecuador has
seen various improvements in the enabling environment resulting from high public
investment in infrastructure, namely, increased access to energy and road infrastructure.


                                            9
However, firms still face numerous constraints, such as labor market rigidities and
difficulties to access finance. While horizontal policies are imperative for an improved
business climate, vertical policies and programs are often necessary in a context of limited
public resources.

5. The need to diversify exports also calls for a deepening of Ecuadorian firms’
integration into Global Value Chains (GVCs) through upgrading1 and linkages to
buyers. Government can play a role in supporting firms to become more competitive by
setting up the institutional structure that would support local clusters to integrate or
upgrade into GVCs. The Competitive Reinforcement Initiative (CRI) methodology
presented in this report provides the initial steps of a complete CRI and the Cluster
Development Programs (CDPs) discussed further on highlight a successful institutional
arrangement for implementing CRIs.

6. This report is divided into seven sections. Section II presents the framework and
cluster screening methodology applied by MIPRO through three workshops held in
February, June and September 2016. The outcome of this screening process was the
identification of 12 priority industries: Textiles and confection; furniture and wood
products; cocoa; coffee, fish; palm; meat products; dairy products; fresh fruit; fresh
vegetables; canned fruit and vegetable; and banana and plantain. A cluster map is also
presented in this section. Section III presents the methodology for the initial steps of a
CRI, including several analytical tools such as strategic segmentation, segment analysis
and the five forces analysis. Section IV demonstrates the use of strategic segmentation,
segment analysis and the five forces analysis for 4 of the 12 prioritized industries, namely:
coffee, cocoa, fish, and wood products. Section V explores the linkages between
productivity, innovation and diversification in agro-industry value chains. Section VI
examines the rationale for CDPs, their effects on firm productivity, and the
institutionalization of CDPs. It also presents examples of CDPs from four countries
(Brazil, Colombia, Austria, and Haiti) and lessons learned from recent evaluations of
these experiences. Section VII provides conclusions and recommendations.

II. IDENTIFICATION AND SCREENING OF CLUSTERS

   A. Framework

7. This paper considers clusters, which are “geographic concentrations of
interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, service providers, firms in related
industries, and associated organizations (such as universities, standard agencies,
trade associations) in a particular field linked by commonalities and
complementarities. There is competition as well as cooperation” (Porter, 1990). In
other words, clusters are geographically concentrated firms in the same value chain. The
value chain refers to the full range of activities that firms and workers perform to bring a
product from its conception to end use and beyond (Gereffi, 2011). Value chains are
typically visualized and analyzed through a value-added chain and cross-border network
relationships. The concept of Global Value Chains has existed for several decades now
and has evolved from a neat sequence of activities into more complex networks of
production, in which participating firms are specialists in one activity and external
international sourcing arrangements require inter-firm trade (Taglioni and Winkler,
2016). Value-added is defined as the total production in a given step of the production
process, net of inputs. Typically, GVCs are governed by a lead firm who is the final buyer
or producer but can include suppliers throughout the production process.

8. GVCs are particularly interesting from a development policy perspective, in
terms of their utility for industrial upgrading, economic development, employment
creation and poverty alleviation (Gereffi, 2005). The opportunities provided by GVCs,
particularly for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) to specialize in only one or a
few of the segments of a value-added chain, knowledge transfer, technology spillovers or
foreign direct investment are attractive for policy makers. But competition is fierce and
LMICs face a set of challenges to enter international production, upgrade to high-value
added products, tasks, and sectors (Taglioni and Winkler, 2016).

9. Given the motivation of MIPRO to develop value chains, the cluster approach
makes it possible to carry out the identification of the determinants of
competitiveness in very specific and operative terms and later [to develop] lines of
action for cluster improvement (Duch, 2004). Cluster selection processes can vary
greatly, from top-down to bottom-up, competitive (e.g. call for proposal) or non-
competitive and can range from technical to more political methods. As such, cluster
selection processes are unique to each country and also depend on institutional
arrangements and capacities (Casaburi and Pittaluga, 2016).

   B. Methodology

10. Selecting clusters is a precursor to any Cluster Development Program (CDP).
The cluster screening methodology presented in this report was developed by The Cluster
Competitiveness Group, Inc. (Competitivenss). This methodology is rooted in business
strategy and cluster change management, which are both equally important when
undertaking a cluster competitive reinforcement initiative. The methodology for strategic
analysis is based on the concepts developed by Michael E. Porter in his various
publications on competitiveness.

11. The cluster screening methodology consists of five steps: (1) identification of
companies in the region, (2) definition of businesses in the region, (3) criteria for


                                            11
cluster definition, (4) criteria for cluster selection, and (5) preliminary strategic
analysis. This methodology is presented below in Figure II.1:

          Source: Competitiveness (www.competitiveness.com).

    C. Technical Assistance: Application of the screening methodology

12. From February to September 2016, the World Bank Group provided technical
assistance to MIPRO through three technical workshops held in Quito, Ecuador.
The objective of this technical assistance was to present a methodology to screen value
chains in order for MIPRO to select a first list of value chains2 with a view to possibly
implementing a CDP in the future. These value chains are not “priority” value chains per
se, but were rather identified as a first group of value chains that MIPRO could select in
order to support in making more innovative and competitive. MIPRO could continue to
select various value chains to support over time. What is more important than “picking”
sectors, is the institutionalization of a program that can support them, which is discussed
in greater detail in Section 6. In August 2016, during the period of the technical assistance,
MIPRO unveiled its Industrial Policy for 2016-2025. As such, this was brought into the
screening exercise. A description of the application of the screening methodology as
carried out in the technical workshops with MIPRO are detailed in Annex 2. The team
that participated in the prioritization is listed in Annex 1.

13. Based on the criteria selected by MIPRO, the following 12 industries were
identified for further support: Textile and apparel; furniture and wood products;
cocoa; coffee; fish; palm; meat products; dairy; fresh fruit; Fresh vegetables;
conserved fruit and vegetable; and banana and plantain. In the process of identifying

  Note on terminology: in this paper, at the national level, we refer to sector and at the local level we refer
to cluster and value chain interchangeably. It is more difficult to speak of value chains at the national
level because as we will see in Section 4, each sector is comprised of various strategic segments, which
each have their own value chain due to different processes and products.


                                                      12
the businesses, it was decided that the following would be excluded in this first group for
the following reasons:

   Metal-mechanics: when analyzing the value chain for metal-mechanics, it was
    evident that metal-mechanics was not a business in and of itself, but rather was a
    business that was part of other value chains (e.g. food production, construction,
    energy, textiles and apparel, wood production, etc…);
   Pharmaceutical products: based on the company data available, only 26 companies
    were counted across the country, divided between Pichincha, Guayas and
    Tungurahua. As such, this industry did not meet the criteria of critical mass of
    companies in a given province;
   Flat steel: Similar to metal-mechanics, flat steel is part of other value chains such as
    automotive and petroleum;
   Shipbuilding: While Ecuador has a long history of shipbuilding, the industry could
    not meet the criteria of critical mass of companies. The Industrial Policy aims to
    attract investment for the construction of a shipyard for the construction and repair of
    ships, requiring an investment of USD 240 million;
   Pulp: In the case of pulp, this industry doesn’t exist yet as there is no pulp mill in the
    country. The Industrial Policy plans to develop the industry, which would require
    investment in commercial forests and the construction of a pulp plant. The Industrial
    Policy states that a plant which could produce pulp and carton could substitute current
    imports, which equals USD 380 million. The inclusion of pulp in the Industrial Policy
    is more geared towards the creation of this industry through the construction of a pulp
    plant (USD 2 billion) and investment in a commercial forest (USD 800 million);
   KIBS, logistics, and transport: these areas were excluded because they are
    horizontal services and Cluster Development Programs tend not to focus on non-
    tradable, horizontal services. Secondly, the August 2015 Action Plan for KIBS
    developed by the World Bank Group for MIPRO provides extensive
    recommendations on instruments and programs to increase supply and demand of
    knowledge intensive services in Ecuador.3

14. In a few cases, industries were further segmented given their large size. For
example, “fruits and vegetables” was disaggregated into the following groups: fresh fruit;
fresh vegetable; conserved fruit and vegetable; and banana and plantain. Banana and
plantain were separated from fresh fruit given their substantial contribution to the
economy in terms of exports and employment. An additional challenge for banana and
plantain is that they are not under the institutional jurisdiction of MIPRO but rather
MAGAP, given that there is no transformation or post-harvest treatment done to the
banana or plantain after it is harvested. Nonetheless, banana and plantain were retained
as they represent a significant amount of exports and employment in the country.

                           i. Scoring

15. In order to quantify and rank cluster importance and potential, a weighting was
applied to each industry (Table II.1). The weighting gives a score of 1 to 5 for each of
the factors considered in the prioritization exercise: critical mass of firms; exports;
employment and innovation. The innovation scores are based on a composite indicator of

    D. Cluster Mapping

16. Cluster mapping is a common tool that provides a visualization of the
geographical concentration of a cluster and can help businesses, policy makers, and
researchers understand the dynamics of a cluster or inter-linkages between them.
Normally, cluster mapping is done at the beginning of a CRI project at the local level. In
the case of this report, a cluster mapping was done at a national level (Figure II.2), to
identify the location of the clusters prioritized by MIPRO.4

                                     Figure II.2. Cluster Mapping




17. What stands out from the cluster mapping is the absence of clusters identified in
the eastern region of the country, from Sucumbíos all the way down to Zamora
Chinchipe. However, this does not mean that MIPRO cannot undertake Competitive
Reinforcement Initiatives in these provinces. Furthermore, if so desired by a government,
the cluster screening exercise (step 3) can include government priorities or regional
development strategies. In the case of the eastern provinces in the cluster map above, the
Productive Territorial Transformation Agendas (ATPT) revealed the existing businesses
in these areas, including: essential oils/natural cosmetics and tourism in Napo; essential
oils/natural cosmetics in Orellana; and ten different businesses in Morona Santiago
including: dairy products, Amazonian fruit pulp, meat products, wood furniture, wood for
construction and tourism.

18. Another rationale for cluster selection can be poverty reduction. For Ecuador, the
poverty map in Figure II.3 shows the highest poverty rates in Napo, Chimborazo and
Morona Santiago, followed by Sucumbios, Orellana, Pastaza, Zamora Chinchipe,

  The map may not completely reflect the geographic location of clusters. While the ATPT identified the
location of the businesses, data from INEC locates the firm where the headquarters is rather than where
the production is actually happening. Given the mixture of these two data sources, there may be some
inaccuracy in the map.

Esmeraldas, Bolivar and Cotopaxi. These provinces also tend to high Gini coefficients.
As such, aligning government policy priorities, such as continuing to reduce poverty in
provinces with the highest poverty levels, can be integrated into the criteria for cluster
screening.

III. COMPETITIVE REINFORCEMENT INITIATIVES: FRAMEWORK AND
METHODOLOGY

    A. Framework

19. The linear model of structural change, from agriculture to industry and to
services, has been radically changed by globalization and the division of labor
(Rodrik, 2013). Not all value chain activities can act as a stepping stone to the next.
Indeed, each value chain activity has a different potential to catalyze economic
development and productive transformation.5 Therefore, as we move into a new, more
uncertain phase of industrialization, it is important to understand where and how value is
created within the global value chain so as to know which value chain activities to
compete for.

20. The Competitive Reinforcement Initiative (CRI) methodology, was adopted by
the European Foundation for Cluster Excellence as a field project methodology, to
apply learnings of the training program for professionals of economic development.
It is a methodology used in many cluster development programs, such as the example of
Brazil presented in section 6.2 of this document. The CRI methodology employs a Ten
Step6 analytical tool that has been widely used in Europe7 and Latin America8 in the last
15 years9, and it is now being tested by the World Bank Group in Haiti and Croatia.
However, similar cluster competitiveness initiatives have been implemented widely in
Latin America since the early 2000s. The analytical methodology allows to move beyond
trade data which usually quantifies ‘how much value’ is created by each country
participating in a GVC, toward ‘how the value’ is created and ‘where in the chain’ to help
policymakers to promote shared value and prosperity. The CRI methodology is one type
of methodology used in CDPs, which are described and discussed more broadly in
Sections 7 and 8.

    B. Methodology

21. The CRI methodology includes strategic analysis based on the concepts
developed by Michael Porter, in his books “Competitive Strategy” (1980),
“Competitive Advantage” (1985), “The Competitive Advantage of Nations” (1990) and
“On Competition” (1998). The Five Forces and the Value Chain are frameworks
commonly used in the analysis. The strategic analysis is combined with sector-level
public-private dialogue with the cluster agents to promote the change process. Guidelines
for public-private dialogue for sector competitiveness and local economic development
are presented in Annex 4. A CRI is a type of Cluster Development Program. The CRI
methodology is presented in more detail in Annex 3.

22. This section highlights two analytical tools used in the CRI process: (1) Strategic
Segmentation and (2) Segment Analysis (Five Forces Analysis).

                           i. Strategic segmentation

23. The Strategic Segmentation of a particular industry seeks to answer the
following two questions:

     (a) What are the different “businesses” that exist in the industry?

     (b) What will the industry consist of “tomorrow”? By looking at the trends and in
         which direction the industry is heading.

24. As can be seen in Table III.1, the Matrix of Strategic Segmentation contains all
the strategic segments of an industry. The strategic segmentation provides a global
overview of the different businesses that exist in a particular sector, and is not country
specific.

                            Table III.1. Matrix of Strategic Segmentation




25. Each strategic segment is a function of both the product (or service) and the user
(or market group) that the product/service serves. The strategic segments are distinct
from one another because the Porter’s Five Forces10 are different; therefore, the value
chain of each segment is also different. As such within a sector, each strategic segment
will have its own value chain.

                           ii. Segment Analysis

26. Once the different strategic segments are identified in the matrix, then each
needs to be analyzed. This analysis fosters to answer the two following questions:

     (a) What would it take for any country/region to compete in this segment that has

   Porter’s Five Forces Analysis is a very useful tool for business strategists. It is based on the
observation that profit margins vary between industries, which can be explained by the structure of an
industry – “Note on the Structural Analysis of Industries” (Michael E. Porter, 1980)


                                                   19
       been identified?

   (b) What does our country/region (the one we are analyzing) have? What doesn’t it
       have? What policy needs to change? What investments need to be made?

27. In order to answer these questions, different strategic tools will be used. For each
strategic segment it is necessary to identify the value chain required at a global level, not
country-specific. Porter’s Five Forces and the challenges and opportunities for
development in the region/country that we are analyzing are important in this analysis.

28. Through Porter’s Five Forces framework, it is possible to assess the
attractiveness of each strategic segment in a given industry by analyzing how
profitable the segment is, and which actors have the most bargaining power and
therefore which actors retain the bulk of said profit. Michael Porter posited in 1979
that “the state of competition in an industry depends on five basic forces”. The
profitability of the segment depends basically on three of them: the threat of new entrants,
the threat of substitute products or services; and jockeying for position among current
competitors. The question of who is retains the margin depends on the other two forces:
the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers. The
combination of the forces will make the segment more or less attractive.

29. The last part to be considered of each strategic segment is to identify which are
the challenges and opportunities for development in the region or country that is
being considered. It means comparing the “ideal value chain” identified with the “real
value chain” in that region / country. The comparison will identify which activities of the
value chain are missing, and thus are the areas of improvement that this region / country
should work on in order to compete in that strategic segment. This will then be translated
into actions, policies to change or make and investments to be made.

IV. PRELIMINARY STRATEGIC ANALYSIS OF THE COFFEE, COCOA,
FISH AND WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE CHAINS

30. This section undertakes a preliminary strategic analysis of the coffee, cocoa, fish
and wood products industries, selected from amongst the prioritized value chains in
Section II. The analysis takes into consideration the recommendations and analysis
undertaken by Bain and Co. in their “Integral Strategic Plan for Agroforestry, Fish and
Aquaculture in Ecuador” report, with a view to presenting the industries through the
strategic analysis lens presented in Section III, in order to stimulate alternative ideas to
improve innovation and competitiveness of these industries. The analysis presented in
this section is differentiated from the Bain Report in that it aims to take a more didactic
approach in order to demonstrate to MIPRO the use of the strategic analysis tools
(strategic segmentation and segment analysis/five forces analysis) based on the four
aforementioned industries. The intention is that MIPRO would be able to replicate such
analysis at the local level with local clusters. While the Bain Report focuses on increasing
the GDP and growth rate for the selected industries, there is little to no focus on the
producers, poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Box IV.1 outlines the
recommendations in the Bain report for these four industries.

       Box IV.1. Bain’s Proposed Investments for the Coffee, Cocoa, Fish, and Wood Industries

       In 2015, Bain & Company produced the report entitled “Ecuador Productivo 2025” for the
       Government of Ecuador. The Report prioritizes and analyzes productive chains in
       agricultural, agro-forestry, fishing industries and intermediate Industries and presented
       investment strategies for their growth. Below, the investments proposed for the development
       of the four value chains examined in Section 4 of this report are presented.

                     which represents US$600 million of investment and 2400
                     direct jobs; 3 chocolate-making plants needed by 2025,
                     which represents US$60 million in investment and 90
                     direct jobs.
         Fish        28 new plants for an investment of US$82 million and        US$116 million
                     approximately 2000 direct jobs by 2025. Investment to
                     improve fishing vessels (currently artisanal) would cost
                     US$34 million.

31. In the 2015 Integral Strategic Plan for Agroforestry, fish and Seafood in
Ecuador, published by Bain and Company, the chapter on the “Coffee Chain and
its byproducts” focuses primarily on “café soluble”, which is freeze-dried instant


                                                 21
coffee, such as the popular Nescafé brand. The strategy posited through the chapter on
coffee is to increase production so as to increase instant coffee exports. The Bain report
chooses not to look into specialty coffee because it represents such a small proportion of
the global coffee market. Although it states that this could be an interesting option for
some regions. This section does look more closely at specialty coffee. Specialty coffee is
an important market segment for Ecuador to consider given that current coffee production
has decreased drastically in Ecuador from 3 million bags per year in 1996 to 300,000 bags
in 2015. If the quantity of coffee produced in Ecuador is declining, then the specialty
coffee market – where margins are much higher and buyers are seeking quality over
quantity – is an important market segment to consider. The retail value of the U.S. coffee
market is estimated to be US$48 billion, with specialty comprising approximately 55%
value share.11 Ecuador now imports more than 1 million bags of Robusta coffee (2014)
for its café soluble, primarily from Vietnam. This inability to produce the primary
material is a concern and affects the competitiveness of Ecuadorian café soluble because
the competitive factors for café soluble is volume and price.

32. Below, two strategic analysis tools – strategic segmentation and the Five Forces
Analysis – are applied to the global coffee industry. The strategic analysis done in this
section is only preliminary since in order to do it with accuracy it is needed the CRI
process of at least 4 months comprised of research on the global industry (by doing
interviews and benchmarking trips to learn from the best references of the sector in the
world) and also local research in Ecuador (by doing interviews to the local cluster agents
of the sector). Table IV.1 below presents the strategic segmentation of coffee.

                   Table IV.1. Strategic Segmentation of the Global Coffee Industry




33. Ecuador competes in the instant coffee market segment (B1 in Table IV.1 above).
A1, B1 and C1 are segments of commercial coffee and A2, B2, and B3 are segments of
specialty coffee.

34. In Segment A1 (coffee beans for consumers seeking caffeine), the Barriers to
entry are relatively low, with geography – i.e. being positioned in a tropical climate
(between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of Capricorn) - being the most
important barrier. Commercial coffee can be a mix of both Robusta and Arabica coffee
beans. Ideal temperature for Robusta coffee is 15 to 24 degrees Celsius and grown
between sea-level and 800 meters. Whereas Arabica coffee is grown ideally between 24
to 30 degrees Celsius and does better in higher altitudes (e.g. above 1300 meters). As
such, depending on the type of commercial coffee being produced, altitude can also be an
important barrier to entry. Robusta coffee beans contain almost twice the caffeine as
Arabica. There are several Substitution products (i.e., substitutes for caffeine) for segment
A1 including tea, soda, and energy drinks. There are many other coffee regions, countries,
and producers; as such, there is a strong rivalry within this segment. Thus, the profitability
of this segment is reduced.

35. On the other hand, if the coffee producers are at the center of the five forces
axes, then their buyers are mainly five industry giants, who control approximately
50% of the commercial coffee market. These are Nestle, Kraft, Procter and Gamble,
Sara Lee, and Tchibo. These companies are large multinationals with strong negotiating
power. As such, the negotiating power of buyers is strong in front of the coffee producers
in the countries and regions where the coffee grows. Therefore, the five industry giants
will retain most of the profit of this business.

36. As such, the attractiveness of this segment for the coffee producers is low. This
predominance of the buyers also prevails as the main force shaping competition in
segments B1 and C1. Furthermore, the consumer in segments A1, B1 and C1 are all
motivated by price only.

37. However, how is this different in segment C2? Figure IV.1 shows the value chain
for the specialty coffee strategic segment. (Note: this is generalized due to the lack of
local information.)

38. In segment C2, by comparison, coffee is sold in a coffee shop to consumers
seeking flavor and experience. The barriers to entry are relatively high because there
are investments in equipment and know-how to open a coffee shop. As such, this is a
positive force for the attractiveness of this segment. There are no substitute products, as
such, this force has a positive effect on the attractiveness of this segment. Given that this
is a high-quality product and there are no substitutes, there is a lot of margin in this
segment. There are much fewer producers in this segment, so rivalry is weak. Negotiating
power of suppliers is weak. The buyers are shrewd consumers ready to pay the high price
for the product. As such, the margins are better distributed in this segment. In conclusion,
there is more money to be made in this segment and the 5 forces have a positive effect on
the attractiveness of this segment.

39. An independent coffee roaster, like the Portland Roasting Company (located in
segment B2), sells a 12 oz bag of whole beans for US$19.00 (or $1.58/oz). In
comparison, 12 oz of whole beans from other commercial coffee companies vary – e.g.
Lavazza ($0.48/oz), Peet’s Coffee, Kicking Horse coffee ($0.81/oz), Starbucks ($0.6-
$1.00/oz) or Caribou Coffee – but on average are below $1.00/oz.12 But where is the
value-added that warrants this price increase. If we look at the characteristics that
advanced independent roasters are looking for, we see a few criteria for purchase,
including: direct relationship with the coffee producers to explain his story and say from
which farm comes from (similar to the winery in the case of the high quality wine), quality
and a relationship based in trust. It means that the switching cost for the roaster to change
the coffee producer, who they buy the coffee beans, is higher than in the Commercial
Coffee. In that one it was a relationship based in price, so if there is a cheaper coffee

producer the purchase manager of Nestle for example, will switch to him automatically.
Whereas in the specialty coffee segment, the buyer wants to be sure that the coffee beans
have enough quality (i.e. a minimum score of 80 points, out of 100)13 to be classified as
Specialty coffee and control the traceability of the beans.

40. Certification, whether certified organic, Rainforest Alliance, or Fair Trade are
not necessarily a requisite for the specialty coffee segment (altitude is a much more
important criteria). Producers and supporting institutions should seek out certifications
based on what the buyers require.

41. Even if the specialty coffee segment is a smaller proportion of the global coffee
industry, this value chain provides more revenue to the country or region’s
producers due to the stronger relationship between the buyers and producers in this
market segment.

       B. Cocoa

42. The cocoa chapter in the Bain report focuses on the question of what proportion
of cocoa beans to process in-country. (They come to the conclusion that 30-60% should
be processed in Ecuador.) Given this line of questioning, it is determined that the high
cost of cocoa beans is one of the main obstacles to manufacturing the cocoa beans and
the focus is turned toward strategies for lowering this price (i.e., increasing productivity).
Furthermore, the chapter is oriented toward investments in processing plants, which cost
US$50 million each, for a minimum capacity to process 60,000 tons of processed cocoa
per year. What is lacking from this analysis is the distinction between the commercial and
specialty chocolate segments. A strategic segmentation of the global cocoa industry
(Table IV.2) divides the industry into 2 segments: Commercial cocoa for chocolate-
lover/non-savvy consumer (A1) and Gourmet/specialty cocoa for the cocoa connoisseur
(B2).

                   Table IV.2. Strategic Segmentation of the Global Cocoa Industry




43. In segment A1, the Barriers to entry are relatively low, with climatic conditions
being the primary barrier. Cocoa grows best in a belt between 10°N and 10°S of the

                                                 25
Equator. Temperature (maximum annual average of 30-32°C and a minimum average of
18-21°C), rainfall (annual rainfall of between 1,500 mm and 2,000 mm) is generally
preferred), humidity (relative humidity is often as much as 100% during the day and 70-
80% at night), light and shade, and soil conditions are all important variables for the
optimum growth of the cocoa tree. The main Substitution products are sweets and
candies. Rivalry is strong given that the barriers to entry are relatively low and there are
many producers of sweets and candies. Positioning the cocoa producers at the center of
the five forces, they have little negotiating power in the face of the large multinational
companies dominating the cocoa industry. Like many agro-industry sectors, cocoa has
also witnessed the tendency towards consolidation. Today, Barry Callebaut
(Switzerland), Cargill (USA), and Olam account for about 60 percent of the world cocoa
processing business (transformation from cocoa beans to butter, powder and liquor). The
actual chocolate-makers (confectionery companies) include: Mars Inc. (USA), Mondelēz
International (USA) and Nestle SA (Switzerland), whose annual sales are all above
US$10 billion. Furthermore, as a global commodity, purchased and sold internationally
on the world market, smallholder cocoa producers have no control over the commodity
price and very little leverage to negotiate with buyers. On the other end, the negotiating
power of suppliers (e.g. inputs) is low. As such, the attractiveness of this segment is low.

44. Segment B2 corresponds to the market segment of cocoa or chocolate
connoisseurs. This consumer is consuming the chocolate for pleasure and appreciates
differentiation of the cocoa based on flavor, quality, origin, etc… If the cocoa producers
are the center of the five forces, the “buyers” are primarily smaller, independent specialty
or “craft” chocolate makers, who invest their time in sourcing the highest quality cocoa
and establishing a personal relationship with the farmers and cooperatives who supply
the cocoa. The buyer also typically buys smaller volumes (e.g. less than a full container),
which makes this segment also more interesting for smallholder farmers or cooperatives
who cannot produce large volumes. Given the buyer’s investment in finding the best
cocoa and establishing relationships with the suppliers, the switching cost is higher,
making the buyer less likely to switch suppliers than in segment A1. This increases the
negotiating power for the cocoa producers. The barriers to entry in segment B2 are the
same, except the standards for quality fermentation are much higher. Given that the
motivation of the consumer is pleasure and the differentiation between the different types
of cocoa based on flavor, quality and origin, the substitute products would be other
specialty products that are consumed for pleasure and can be differentiated based on
flavor, quality and origin. These would include fine wine and cigars, for example.

45. Cocoa beans are traded on several world exchanges including the ICE Futures
Europe, ICE Futures U.S. and NYSE Liffe Futures and Options. The average price
in February 2017 was US$ 2045.98 per ton. This would be the price for buyers in Segment
A1. In contrast, Meridian Cacao Co. (a cocoa bean importer) a cocoa importer based in
Portland, Oregon sells cocoa beans to craft chocolate makers for an average of US$ 2500
per ton but will sell for $4000-7000 per ton for the highest quality chocolate. Given that
this is direct trade with fewer intermediaries, it is assumed that more of the margin ends
up in the hands of the farmer and the farmer benefits from various social benefits, such
as higher wages for staff and regular doctor visits to the farmer.14 Similar to the specialty

or not. Below a generalized value chain for “specialty cocoa” is presented.

   C. Fish

46. The chapter on fish in the Bain report focuses on fish production and fishing at
the national level. The report presents several recommendations which emphasize
increasing the productivity of the frozen fish plants, for example, or increasing shrimp
production in aquaculture. However, what the report is missing is an analysis of the
different possible businesses (strategic segments) within the fish industry, which requires
different activities in the value chain, and therefore represents different challenges for the
companies and agents competing. Table IV.3 shows some of the strategic segments in the
fish industry.

                 Table IV.3. Strategic Segmentation of the Global Fish Industry




                                              27
47. As seen in Table IV.3, several strategic segments have different challenges for
the companies competing in them. Segment B1, fish or seafood processed with a long-
term duration (frozen, cooked, canned) for consumers seeking basic feeding, has different
five forces than Segment C2, and therefore different levels of attractiveness.

48. In segment B1, competition in the last 10 years had been increasing as other
country rivals are getting bigger and China has become an important player. This
segment emphasizes reducing the cost of production, so the barriers to entry to compete
in this segment include very efficient production plants, but with the threat that other
countries with lower production costs can enter at any time. In terms of substitutes, since
the consumer is seeking cheap protein, there are many substitutes, like chicken for
example, for which the price has been declined steadily over the last 15 years. Thus, the
margin in this segment seems to have been reducing over the last years and split amongst
more players. Also, the margin at the end is mostly kept by the buyers, i.e. the retailers.
Despite the large market size, the retailers are becoming increasingly consolidated which
has increased their negotiating power. As such, when the buyers’ main criteria for buying
frozen fish is the price, they are willing to buy containers of fish from whomever offers
the lowest price.

49. On the other hand, Segment C2 includes a new barrier to entry, which is the
complexity of the logistics. Transporting fresh fish and seafood is very delicate, and the
cold chain has to be guaranteed in order to ensure the quality of the food in the store. In
this case, the fish cannot come from China because it has to be sources more locally or
be transported in a fast cold chain, which could include air transport in some cases. On
the other hand, since the consumer is seeking healthy protein, there are fewer substitutes.
Thus, the margin in this segment is higher and there is less rivalry to split the margin.
While the buyers are still the large retailers (supermarkets) which are becoming
increasing consolidated, the main criteria for buying is no longer the price but the
guarantee that the fish is delivered regularly (every day) in quality condition and with the
right cold chain. The switching cost increases in this segment and the relationship with
the buyer is based more on trust, given the need for more regular deliveries and stricter
logistical conditions.

50. Therefore, some interesting questions can be asked at this point for Ecuador in
response to the recommendations for the fish industry proposed in the Bain report.
Namely, is investment in frozen treatment plants the most suitable investment for
Ecuador?

51. When looking further at the production of fish or shrimp, in aquaculture or
through traditional fishing, the analysis is even more interesting. As shown in Figure
IV.3, both methods of production are converging at the point of commercialization for
both of the strategic segments, but with different challenges. The key questions to ask
include: “who is going to benefit from the investment in a shrimp production plant?”;
“Are we trying to help the bigger companies with big production and aquaculture plants
or the small communities of fishermen?”

   D. Wood Products

52. According to the Bain report, wood production is primarily used for energy
production (50%), mainly for the domestic market, and the rest is used to make
boards, pulp and other products that can be used as input for other industries.

               Table IV.4. Types of companies in the Wood Industry by Province




   Source: MIPRO, 2016.

53. However, when analyzing the types of companies within the wood industry by
province (Table IV.4), the data looks quite different from the national figures. As
seen in the table above, the majority of companies are working in furniture and finishing
products for the construction industry. Even without having the information of the
number of employees or the aggregated revenues, the analysis can be done in a different
way using the strategic segmentation tools, as done for the other sectors. In this sense, the
interesting part is not to finish the analysis with the value chain until the logs become a
board or pulp as it is done in the Bain report, but to finish the whole global value chain
until it is a finished product satisfying a consumer need. For this reason, in order to do a


                                             29
comprehensive analysis, then all the different applications of the wood should be
analyzed separately. This means doing a strategic segmentation for each application:
furniture, construction materials, paper, etc. This, combined with the challenges faced at
each one of the regions, will become a different strategy to follow for each cluster. But
again, for that, a CRI must be done for each local value chain (cluster) by doing the
analysis based on local information collected in the field and undertaking a local
diagnostic.

54. As an example, without entering into too much detail, below there is the strategic
segmentation for the case of furniture for hotels and offices, what is known as
Contract Manufacturing.

                       Table IV.5. Strategic Segmentation for Contract
                                       Manufacturing




55. In the case of the hotels, when looking at the Segment A1, hotel owners buying
the furniture needed in a room, the value chain will start from wood production and
end at furniture making. The barriers to entry are clearly very low, so all countries with
cheap production can compete, thus the rivalry is high. China is buying logs from other
parts of the world (including Ecuador) to produce cheap furniture. Regarding the power
of the buyers in this case, it has been increased dramatically, since the hotels are
concentrated in large hotel chains. Their main purchasing criteria is price, within the
parameters of quality that they request. But overall, they will always try to find the best
deal in cost.

56. Going down the rows of products/services presented in the segmentation above,
the power of the buyers is decreasing, since there are other criteria entering into the
purchasing negotiation: the assembly, the maintenance, the fact of not only buying
the furniture but also the textiles in the room (curtains, blankets, etc.). The assembly
and the maintenance are adding a local service aspect to the product, which means that


                                             30
the supplier of furniture has to bring local staff to do the work, with an operational
structure in place in order to provide maintenance on short notice. This again, as seen in
other industries before, brings higher switching costs for the buyers. The hotel owner has
a closer relationship with the supplier than previously, and the relationship is not based
on something as fragile as price alone. The barriers to entry are also increasing, since the
company providing the service has to be local, meaning the ones from China cannot
compete. Thus, rivalry is clearly also lower.

57. In the last segment “E1,” the hotel owner directly rents the service of outfitting
his/her hotel rooms. He pays a rental fee per room and the company providing the service
will be the one in charge of purchasing the furniture, curtains, painting the room,
assembling furniture, maintaining it, replacing it and anything else in order to have a
perfect room according to the specifications of the hotel owner. In exchange, this
company signs a contract with the hotel owner for 10-15 years.

58. However, some questions need to be made at this point: which companies are we
aiming to help? The wood producers or the furniture makers? The answer will vary if
the CRI is done in a province where the most number of companies are in wood
production or furniture making. The attractiveness of one segment over another may vary
based on which companies we seek to help.

V. DIVERSIFICATION, INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY IN
AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS

59. The Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index identifies sectors and
products where Ecuador exceeds global export averages. In 2013, the sectors and
products with the highest competitive advantage for Ecuador were: vegetables, animal
products, food products and petroleum15. It comes as no surprise that 10 out of the 12
industries prioritized through the cluster screening exercise are in the agroindustry sector
given the Latin American region’s natural competitive advantage in agriculture due to its
water and land resources. Latin America has approximately 28% of potential new arable
land (second only to Sub-Saharan Africa) and also holds the highest share of renewable
water resources (World Bank Group, 2013). As a net food exporter, Latin America has
an important role to play in meeting the needs for global food security but at the same
time needs to make improvements in their trade policy, logistics, production (scaling up
output) in order to meet this challenge (Chaherli and Nash, 2013).

60. While Ecuador’s export basket consists mainly of primary products, in
particular agricultural and aquaculture-based industry, there is considerable scope
to upgrade into higher value added products in these same industries. However,
entering into higher value added products requires, inter alia, productivity improvements
and technology adoption. These improvements and the types of technology or innovation
needed can be directly informed through the CRI process. Ahmed and Hamrick (2016)
present a typology for upgrading strategies in agricultural GVCs through three types:
functional, product or process upgrading (Table V.1).

61. Entering higher value-added agricultural value chains requires upgrading,
certification and standardization, all of which are examples of innovation. The
Global Innovation Index ranks Ecuador 100 out of 128 countries, with particularly weak
performance in business sophistication and knowledge outputs. If Ecuador seeks to
upgrade into higher value-added markets, improving innovation capabilities will need to
be a priority.16 Changes in consumer demand, technological innovations and changes in
production patterns are some of the factors that make agricultural GVCs complex and call
for improved traceability and production standards.

62. Ecuador has the necessary elements of a National Quality Infrastructure (NQI)
to support the private sector. These include the Servicio Ecuatoriana de Normalizacion
(INEN) and the Servicio de Acreditacion Ecuatoriano (SAE), which offer some services
needed by the private sector to conform to international trading partners’ standards. INEN
serves as the national standards body and national metrology institute, while SAE acts as
the national accreditation body. These two institutions serve a market private and public
conformity assessment bodies, including certification bodies, inspection bodies, testing
laboratories and inspection laboratories. There are almost 400 nationally accredited
conformity assessment bodies in Ecuador, including some industry leaders, such as
Bureau Veritas and SGS and smaller local players. While Ecuador’s local market for
conformity assessment can cover basic needs, many gaps still exist. INEN is a member
of the major international standard bodies, ISO and IEC, but with 6600 official national
standards, INEN is experiencing challenges to meet the demand from the private sector.
Furthermore, both INEN and SAE need to adopt a more market-oriented approach to be
able to respond to market demands. The recent Industrial Policy stated that Ecuador lacks
the NQI to support industries: only 1/3 of products are supported by local quality
infrastructure to obtain certifications. The rest of these products must be sent outside of
Ecuador to obtain certifications to meet international standards, which increases costs for
the firms (MCPEC/MIPRO, 2016). NQI institutions report a limited culture of quality in
the private sector. So while firms necessarily require certifications to comply with quality
certifications demanded in certain markets, international experience shows the adoption

  A deeper analysis of innovation in the priority value chains selected by MIPRO through this NLTA is
presented in the complementary report on Innovation (Rubalcaba et al., 2017).

revenues and growth.17

63. While competitive forces vary from product to product, in many cases,
agricultural GVCs are highly concentrated with large multinational firms in North
America and Europe dominating the high value added markets, such as
agrochemicals, processing and marketing (Ahmed and Hamrick, 2016). This makes
it more difficult but even more important for smaller firms and smallholder farmers to
work as a cluster, understand supply and demand in their industry and find points of
aggregation or consolidation to bring costs down.

64. Diversifying within agriculture, from lower value-added to higher value-added
products, is one way to view diversification, versus the idea of diversifying away
from agriculture into other sectors such as manufacturing or services. In the same
way, transformation of a primary good should not be equated with value addition. In some
cases, transformation of a product can in fact destroy value by downgrading to a less
competitive product (e.g. selling fresh mangoes vs. producing dried mango – the fresh
mango has a much higher margin then the dried mango). However, adding value almost
always will entail changes in production practices and innovation, which have as much,
or more, to do with strategy and change management as it has to do with cost. The
implication of this for Ecuador is the need to reframe how value addition is perceived for
agricultural products and to emphasize value addition rather than transformation.

65. Structural transformation refers to the extent to which economic growth is
impacted by the expansion or contraction of the most productive sectors. Typically,
the weight of agriculture in the economy falls, while that of services increases, while
manufacturing’s share of employment (and value added) exhibits an inverted U-shaped
patterns. As such, it is certain that Ecuador will not achieve economic growth by
expansion of the agricultural sector alone. There is indeed a need for productivity gains
in all sectors. However, the cluster screening exercise undertaken with MIPRO
demonstrates the strength of these clusters and their potential for development. Based on
this, it is necessary to understand productivity growth in agriculture as a whole in order
to inform policy decisions or institutional arrangements.

66. Furthermore, diversification of national production away from petroleum does
not mean that selection of clusters to undergo CRIs should preclude the selection of
the petroleum industry. In fact, it would be interesting to undertake a CRI in a
petroleum-producing region to see whether there are companies providing industrial
maintenance services for the oil and related industries, like plastic, chemical or other
related industries. It may be possible to improve the competitiveness of these types of
companies, improve their position in specialized and integral services, and potentially
identify a strategy to export their services. If an auxiliary industry to petroleum, such as
industrial maintenance services, could be developed as a tradable service, then Ecuador
could export these services to neighboring countries, or even those further afield.

VI. CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS: RATIONALE, EFFECTS ON
PRODUCTIVITY AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION

   A. Cluster Development Programs: rationale and effects on productivity

67. The public sector can play a catalytic role in improving firms’ upgrading and
integration into GVCs. The key rationale for government intervention in the private
sector is solving market failures, and in the case of clusters and value chains, these are
coordination and information failures. Cluster Development Programs (CDPs) are public
interventions that foster the beneficial effects of economies of by creating a set of
incentives to overcome coordination failures that hamper the development of some
industries in specific locations. These coordination failures could be private-private,
private-public and public-public. Types of coordination failures include: poor resource
allocation/investment choices, weak inter-firm linkages, inefficient local labor markets,
and poor knowledge diffusion and innovation. CDPs are “doomed to choose” sectors,
since resources are always scarce and economic agglomerations plenty, at least in terms
of where to start in cases where the final goal is to work with all clusters meeting a given
definition (Casaburi, 2016). While CDPs take different forms, they typically involve the
following activities:

   (a) Mapping and selecting clusters to be supported in the target territory;

   (b) Identification of challenges and needs for policy intervention at the individual
       cluster level;

   (c) Implementation of actions identified in stage (ii); and,

   (d) Monitoring and evaluation (Casaburi, 2016).

68. CDPs are “designed to improve firms’ performance through the strengthening
of the firms’ network to foster coordination and allow collective actions and the
provision of public and club goods” (Alfaro, 2016). As such, CDPs first try to fix
coordination failures, after which a change in resource allocation and investment is
usually expected.

69. Investments identified through a CDP that can help to solve coordination
failures within a cluster could include various public or club goods and services. A
Government of Ecuador program may support value chains where the opportunity is
highest to promote backward linkages of shared facilities, equipment, and services, with
a requirement for counterpart funding (matching grants). Examples of possible needs
include: cold chain equipment; logistics centers or services; traceability systems; testing
laboratories; design centers; joint design of packaging and labeling appropriate for
foreign markets; etc… (World Bank Group, 2015).

70. While significant public resources have been allocated to CDPs, the evidence of
the effectiveness of these types of programs has been scarce. However, in recent years,
some impact evaluations of CDPs have been undertaken such as Maffioli (2005) who
evaluated the PROFO (Proyectos Asociativos de Fomento) program in Chile aimed at
fostering networking, cooperation and collective efficiency. The main result of the
evaluation was that there were positive effects on productivity. Similarly, in 2010, Falck,
Heblich and Kipar evaluated the cluster policy introduced in 1999 in Bavaria, Germany,


                                            35
aimed at fostering innovation and regional competitiveness by stimulating cooperation
between science, business, and finance in five key technology fields. The evaluation
found positive effects on the likelihood of becoming an innovator, access to external
know-how, cooperation with public scientific institutes and the availability of suitable
R&D personnel (Garone, 2016). The impact evaluation of the Arranjos Productivos
Locais (APL) policy in Brazil (Garrone, 2016) found examples of positive spillover
effects which can include the value of total exports and the likelihood of exporting. Figure
VI.1 illustrates the effects of CDPs over time. Business performance, including
productivity, is shown to be affected last, in the medium to long term. CDPs are designed
to improve firms’ performance through the strengthening of the firms’ network to foster
coordination and allow collective actions and the provisions of public and club goods.
Therefore, CDPs are not meant to affect firms’ performance directly or immediately, but
through a series of intermediate effects that eventually lead to efficiency gains. As such,
evaluations of CDPs take into account this essential time dimension and can be evaluated
by their spillover and intermediate to long-term effects.

      Source: Alfaro, 2016.
      Note: Network density is the number of actors (“nodes” in a network); network intensity is
      the value and relevance of linkages.

71. In complement to the effects noted in Figure VI.1, CDPs also contribute policy
recommendations to improve the business climate, including those that are very
sector specific to those that have broader economy-wide application, such as labor
regulations.

   B. Institutionalization of CDPs and examples of other countries’ experiences

72. CDPs are not unknown in Ecuador. There have previously been Competitiveness
Improvement Programs (“Programa de Mejora Competiva” [PMC]) in Ecuador, such as
those implemented by MIPRO around 2011-2012 and more recently by MAGAP.

73. Various lessons have been gathered from previous CDPs which can be valuable
for the implementation of a sustainable CDP in Ecuador. These include: a clear



                                                 36
commitment to cluster policy by the Government; allowing adequate preparation time for
institution building; efficient public-public coordination between the CDP and other
public programs and policies; adaptation of the cluster development methodology and
program design to the level of institutional maturity of the actors; selection of the right
executing agency capable of executing locally in selected areas and to manage the local
public-private dialogue and ensuring bottom-up development; and adequate funding. In
addition to strategic planning for the development of competitiveness of the cluster, CDPs
often include co-financing of activities and the establishment of governance structures
(Casaburi, 2016). This co-financing is typically for public or club goods and comes in
various forms, normally government or donor-funded, or a mix of both. However, for the
long-term sustainability of a CDP, it is in the interest of the institution in charge to work
towards self-financing mechanisms, as in the Box VI.3 below.

74. An executing agency capable of facilitating the cluster development process and
play the role of change agent locally is critical for the success of a CDP. This
executing agency would facilitate interaction between the various agents, convince the
entrepreneurs or producers to make a change into a new strategic segment where they can
be in a better position to compete and identifying local leaders who could be responsible
for the execution of the plans to improve the competitiveness of the cluster. In order to
act a local facilitator, the executing agency should have knowledge and wide acceptance
(credibility) by all parties, as well as an awareness of the latest cluster development
methodologies worldwide. It is difficult for an external consulting firm to do this through
short, analytical work because while they may be able to undertake good quality strategic
analysis, they lack the local knowledge and the acceptance to act as local change agents.
The change process resulting from a CRI might be slow and therefore it is crucial that the
facilitators are local agents, already embedded in the community, but at the same time
independent from the private sector, to avoid being captured by it. Furthermore, in order
to execute the long-term vision, the knowledge needs to remain in the field. The best
combination would be to build the capacity on the CRI methodology locally to ensure the
sustainability of the process. Guidelines for carrying out local Public-Private Dialogue
(PPD) are presented in Annex 4.

75. The institutional organization of cluster development support can take various
forms. Below are four examples of country experiences of CDPs in Brazil (Box VI.1),
Colombia (Box VI.2), Austria (Box VI.3), and Haiti (Box VI.4).

       Box VI.1. Brazil Cluster Programs Using the CRI Methodology
       SEBRAE, Support Service for Micro and Small Enterprises, is one of the leading
       organizations for the promotion of economic development in Brazil. Although it was
       established as an autonomous entity since 1990, SEBRAE had its origins in the 1970s when it
       consolidated a formal structure to support small and medium enterprises within the Federal
       Ministry of Planning, after several government efforts in the previous decade. The CEBRAE,
       as it was called in this early period, grew exponentially, reaching virtually every state in the
       country two years after its creation.18 In a country of continental proportions such as Brazil,
       SEBRAE was divided into autonomous state organizations to increase efficiency in resource
       allocation.




          SEBRAE MG, the autonomous branch responsible for operations in the Brazilian state of
           Minas Gerais, in 2009 began implementing a new methodology based on CRIs to guide its
           projects for Arranjos Productive Locais (APLs – how the Brazilians referred to clusters
           and local value chains). The methodology consisted in carrying out different CRIs that
           aimed at increasing the competitiveness of certain industries in the region. After the pilot
           implementation of this methodology in 4 sectors (mango, electronics, tourism and
           furniture), SEBRAE-MG decided it was essential to absorb it within its structure, since
           they wanted to start implementing on its own.
          SEBRAE SPO, in 2009 the branch in the state of Sao Paulo, started a program to support
           the competitiveness of the companies in 14 APLs, funded by the Inter-American
           Development Bank (IDB). The sectors included furniture, footwear, apparel, home-textile,
           dental health, ceramics, plastics, figs and bio-ethanol, amongst others. It was a
           methodological transfer program to build capacity within the SEBRAE and its local teams
           spread all over the state’s regions.
          An Impact evaluation of cluster policies in Brazil has shown APLs in Minas Gerais and
           Sao Paolo had positive effects on employment and exports for participating SMEs.

iNNpulsa Colombia, an entity formed under the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and
Tourism in Colombia in 2012, started a CRI Transfer Program in 18 of its regions using
the Chambers of Commerce as local change agents since they were very close to the
companies and entrepreneurs. The program was carried out over 3 phases in different
sectors of agribusiness, industry and tourism, working in 36 cluster initiatives and actively
involving SMEs. Today the local teams of the Chambers of Commerce are working
autonomously on further Cluster Initiatives and their implementation, maximizing local
resources.

           Box VI.3. Clusterland Upper Austria
           Austria's constitution characterizes the republic as a federation consisting of nine
           autonomous federal states. The region of Upper Austria is located in central Austria with the
           Czech Republic to the North and Germany (Bavaria) to the west. With 14% of the area, in
           2011 Upper Austria was the fourth largest federal province and the nation´s leading state with
           regards to industry and exports (25% of industrial production and 27% of the nation´s
           exports).19
           Clusters had also been developing in Upper Austria since the late 1990s under the
           supervision of Austria´s location and innovation agency (TMG). In January 2006, the
           government of Upper Austria decided to create Clusterland Upper Austria, an independent
           entity to manage six clusters (automotive, plastics, furniture & timber construction, health
           technology, mechatronics, and environmental technology) and three networks (human
           resources, design media and network energy) with the objective to be market oriented and
           work closely with the companies.
                           Figure VI.3. Clusterland Upper Austria Organization Chart




           As Figure VI.3 shows, TMG was the main shareholder of the new legal body, with 61%
           ownership, with the rest of the shares belonging to the Upper Austrian Chamber of
           Commerce (19.5%) and the Federation of Austrian Industry (19.5%). The Advisory
           Board was comprised of 12 members, six of them representing the shareholders and the rest
           representing five clusters and one network (directly companies). Then each cluster
           organization has its own advisory board initiated by Clusterland Upper Austria and formed by
           companies. Each of the 39 employees of Clusterland Upper Austria had specific roles in the
           organization, besides working in a specific cluster or network.
           Clusterland Upper Austria was almost completely publicly financed at the beginning,
           but the level of self-financing has been increasing every year, with private financing
           accounting for two thirds of the budget in 2010. In 2011, the public funding was €1.5
           million.

Box VI.4. Haiti Enterprise Support Service (SAE)

In 2014, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (Ministère du Commerce et de
l’Industrie) created a program to support entrepreneurs across the country. This
decentralized service, called the Enterprise Support Service (Service d’Appui aux
Entreprises - SAE), are present in all ten Departments of the country, and amongst
other things, supports entrepreneurs to become more productive and competitive
through the development of value chains. The SAE teams work in their Departments
to develop public-private dialogue. In particular, they work in partnership with other
key partners such as the Chambers of Commerce, Departmental offices of the
Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation,
etc.

A World Bank Group grant (“Business Development and Investment Project”)
and a Competitive Industries and Innovation Program (CIIP) grant for Haiti
are helping build the capacity of the new SAE teams through training, coaching,
and other technical assistance. In order to carry out value chain initiatives, the CIIP
program has financed a training program on the CRI methodology to SAE teams, as
well as other Government ministries and Chambers of Commerce, on the
methodology for carrying out such initiatives. The CIIP grant also financed coaching
for each team. From 2014-2016, the SAE teams have been working with over 600
micro and small entrepreneurs in the following sectors: coffee, cocoa, mango,
avocado, honey, apparel and vetiver (Figure VI.4).

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

76. The upgrading of Ecuadorian firms into high value added market segments is
an important aspect of transforming the productive matrix in Ecuador. This NLTA
put forward a cluster development approach to improving firms’ performance in the
medium to long term, with more immediate improvements in coordination, linkages, and
resource allocation and investment in the shorter term. The technical assistance provided
to MIPRO was limited to the transfer of a cluster screening methodology, which resulted
in the selection of twelve clusters, namely: textiles and confection; furniture and wood
products; cocoa; coffee, fish; palm; meat products; dairy products; fresh fruit; fresh
vegetables; canned fruit and vegetable; and banana and plantain. However, this report
goes further in providing an overview of the initial strategic analysis tools used in the CRI
methodology, including strategic segmentation, segment analysis, Five Forces analysis,
and Sector-Specific Public-Private Dialogue. These tools allow for a deeper
understanding of the competitive forces within different market segments and
demonstrate the importance of local information and analytics in understanding cluster
competitiveness. Given the inability to thoroughly collect local information in this NLTA,
the report applies these tools at a national level for four industries: coffee, cocoa, fish and
wood products.

77. One advantage of the five forces analysis is that it permits targeting of specific
groups of firms or entrepreneurs by placing them in the middle of the Five Forces
and the competitive forces specific to their current situation. This type of analysis has
been done in a World Bank Group-financed project in Haiti, where micro enterprises and
smallholder farmers were the target beneficiaries and the strategic analysis proposed
global value chains where they could best compete and increase their value added in the
production process. In the case of the clusters identified through this technical assistance,
a key question for future interventions would be to determine who the target beneficiaries
are. If poverty reduction and improving the situation for the bottom 40 is a priority, then
this could be factored into the selection of clusters. As we can see from the cluster
mapping, there are coffee clusters in Manabí, Loja and El Oro. However, the types of
“firms” are different. Manabí, where the coffee exporting association ANECAFE is
based, has larger firms producing lower altitude Arabica coffee. Loja has a higher
concentration of poverty than Manabí, for example, and the coffee producers are more
likely poorer in Loja than in Manabí. So targeting a CRI in Loja could have more returns
for the Bottom 40, than Manabí.

78. The selection criteria selected during this NLTA led to the dominance of
agroindustry in the final selection of sectors. This points to the competitive advantages
Ecuador has in agricultural products, but moving to higher value-added agroindustry
products will require the use of specialized services, many of which are not available in
Ecuador. CRIs can help inform the types of specialized services needed, such as
consulting, logistical, traceability, software or standards/certification.

79. The linkage between CDPs and productivity are discussed in Section 7.1, where
evaluations of CDPs have shown the effects of CDPs over time, with corrections to
coordination failures in the short term and a progression to improvement in
business performance in the longer term. Finally, the paper discusses the importance
of institutionalization of CDPs and the importance of strong local presence to gather local
data and undertaken analyses. This “local” factor is the main difference between CDPs
and studies, like the Bain Report, whose analysis remains at the national level. The local


                                              42
analysis in a CDP helps to identify the actions which are needed locally and then there
are the policies that need to be adapted or created which would be dealt with at the
national level.

80. Finally, if a government wants to pursue CDPs, they require the adequate
institutional arrangements to support these policies and programs. This paper
provides four examples of CDPs in Brazil, Colombia, Austria and Haiti. These
experiences highlight the diversity of experiences and the range of possible institutional
options.

81. This paper concludes with the following recommendations for MIPRO:

   (a) Future value chain studies in Ecuador should include in their analysis how
       value is distributed along the value chain and how to help increase the value-
       added of smaller firms and/or smallholder farmers. This would allow a greater
       focus on poverty reduction by identifying what support (goods or service) smaller
       firms need to gain more value in the value chain. For example, would proposed
       investments benefit a few large firms or a greater number of poorer, smallholder
       farmers?

   (b) Given Ecuador’s natural competitive advantage in agriculture,
       diversification should not focus on switching to other non-agricultural
       sectors, but rather upgrading into higher-value added agricultural value
       chains. However, these higher-value added agricultural value chains are more
       complex, as such agribusiness firms will require more specialized services such
       as improved National Quality Infrastructure and specialized logistics services
       (e.g. cold chain), to name a few. Strengthening the capacity of the country’s NQI
       institutions - INEN and SAE - and filling several gaps in the NQI would be
       necessary to provide the services needed by the private sector to export products.

   (c) It is recommended to undertake an assessment or Public Expenditure review
       of competitiveness improvement and other industry-supporting programs
       that have been implemented in Ecuador over the past years. Such a review
       would allow the Government of Ecuador to consider the effectiveness and
       outcomes of these programs to date. Furthermore, the findings could also be used
       as inputs to improve the design of future competitiveness improvement programs,
       in terms of their cost-effectiveness, design and sustainability.

   (d) Cluster Development Programs can help firms become more innovative,
       increase the likelihood of exporting and improve productivity over time. By
       enhancing coordination and linkages, CDPs can impact resource allocation and
       investments, business practices and technologies and finally business
       performance of firms. However, as recent case studies and evaluation of CDPs
       have shown there are some factors that can ensure a greater chance of success,
       including: a clear commitment to cluster policy by the Government; allowing
       adequate preparation time for institution building; efficient public-public
       coordination between the CDP and other public programs and policies; adaptation
       of the cluster development methodology and program design to the level of
       institutional maturity of the actors; selection of the right executing agency capable
       of executing locally in selected areas and to manage the local public-private
       dialogue and ensuring bottom-up development; and adequate funding. In addition


                                            43
    to strategic planning for the development of competitiveness of the cluster, CDPs
    often include co-financing of activities and the establishment of governance
    structures.

(e) The Government of Ecuador could support CDPs in selected regions but
    should apply lessons learned from past CDP experiences in other countries
    to ensure success of the program. Recent case studies and evaluations have
    shown that in order for CDPs to be successful and sustainable, they require the
    right design (both in terms of structure and governance), and adequate time for
    institution building and program preparation. Public-public collaboration is also
    a critical success factor, and in the case of the value chains identified in this report,
    collaboration between MAGAP and MIPRO is fundamental for the success of any
    agribusiness CDP and collaboration with ProEcuador is also important in terms
    of market linkages and export promotion. Furthermore, they should focus on
    solving coordination failures within a cluster, and if possible, have funds available
    to co-finance public or club goods and services. A Government of Ecuador
    program may support value chains where the opportunity is highest to promote
    backward linkages of shared facilities, equipment, and services, with a
    requirement for counterpart funding (matching grants). Examples of possible
    needs include: cold chain equipment; logistics centers or services; traceability
    systems; testing laboratories; design centers; joint design of packaging and
    labeling appropriate for foreign markets; etc. In the short-term, it would be
    interesting for MIPRO to explore how existing programs, such as Encadena,
    could adopt some of the methodologies and lessons learned presented in this
    paper.

                       Annex B. Cluster screening methodology

B.1. Methodology

82. Selecting clusters is a precursor to any Cluster Development Program (CDP).
The cluster screening methodology presented in this report was developed by The
Competitiveness Group, Inc.. This methodology is rooted in business strategy and cluster
change management, which are both equally important when undertaking a cluster
competitive reinforcement initiative. The methodology for strategic analysis is based on
the concepts developed by Michael E. Porter in his various publications on
competitiveness.

83. The cluster screening methodology consists of 5 steps: (1) identification of
companies in the region, (2) definition of businesses in the region, (3) criteria for
cluster definition, (4) criteria for cluster selection, and (5) preliminary strategic
analysis. This methodology is presented below in Figure B.1:

                    Figure B.1. Cluster Screening Methodology Flow Chart




 Source: Competitiveness (www.competitiveness.com).

84. Below is a step by step presentation of implementation of the methodology by
MIPRO.

   (a) Step 1: identification of companies in the region

            (i)     In step 1, the MIPRO team reviewed the work done previously in
                    the ATPT which identified businesses in each of the 24 provinces,
                    which were divided into 7 zones. Initially, 252 businesses were
                    identified, although there were some inconsistencies between
                    industry segmentation across regions. For example, in Zone 1, coffee
                    was segmented into Arabica coffee, Robusta coffee, organic Arabica
                    coffee with origin label (zone 1), while other zones only presented


                                              46
               Processed and decaffeinated coffee (zone 4) or simply coffee (zone
               7). While the methodology calls for the deployment of teams to
               gather information on companies through interviews (e.g. name of
               company, number of employees, annual sales and description of
               business activity), given the limitations of this Technical Assistance,
               the MIPRO team instead used the ATPT to identify the businesses in
               their assigned zones.

(b) Steps 2 and 3: Definition of the businesses in the region and Criteria for
    cluster definition

        (i)    The second and third steps called for the definition of a
               “business” and a “cluster.” To define a business, one must ensure
               there is a clear and common business, a sufficient critical mass of
               companies to ensure the presence of a large enough cluster,
               geographic concentration, a certain level of complexity in the value
               chain, and the presence of support institutions. To illustrate what is
               meant by “business”, we can ask ourselves if a metal-mechanics
               company is in the auto manufacturing business, the petroleum
               business or the metal-mechanics business? To answer this question,
               normally one would visit the firms to confirm what business they are
               in. A cluster of firms requires, inter alia, a clear and common business
               among the companies and a minimum critical mass of firms within
               geographic proximity. In this exercise, it was agreed with MIPRO
               that a critical mass would be defined as at least 20 companies in the
               same geographic area. Furthermore, companies must exist in order to
               identify an industry. A newer industry, such as nanotechnology,
               where few companies exist, would not meet the minimum criteria for
               inclusion in the cluster screening. This does not preclude that
               companies in adjacent or similar industries cannot make a move into
               a new product or industry, but this must be the result of a completed
               CRI.

        (ii)   During step two of the methodology, MIPRO was also finalizing
               its Industrial Policy, which was published in August 2016. The
               Industrial Policy prioritized 16 industries in the areas of (i)
               agroindustry, (ii) intermediate and final industries, (iii) services and
               (iv) basic industries. These 16 industries are: (i) coffee derivatives,
               cocoa derivatives, fish and seafood products, palm, fruits and
               vegetables, dairy products, bioenergy; (ii) metal-mechanics, textiles,
               medicine for human consumption, furniture and wood products; (iii)
               ship making, pulp, flat steel; (iv) KIBS (software and IT services,
               consulting, quality and training), and logistics and transport. In order
               to align with the Industrial Policy, it was agreed to base the
               identification of clusters on the 12 industries included in the
               Industrial Policy, rather than the business identified in the ATPT.
               However, given that the Industrial Policy is based on the
               Transformation of the Productive Matrix, the industries did not




                                       47
                deviate greatly from industries previously considered.

(c) Step 4 Criteria to select clusters

        (i)     In the next step of defining the criteria for cluster selection, the
                MIPRO team decided to use exports and employment as their
                quantitative criteria and level of innovation as their qualitative
                criteria. Based on the criteria selected by MIPRO, the following 12
                industries were selected: Textile and apparel; furniture and wood
                products; cocoa; coffee; fish; palm; meat products; dairy; fresh fruit;
                Fresh vegetables; conserved fruit and vegetable; and banana and
                plantain. In the process of identifying the businesses, it was some
                industries were excluded for the reasons cited in section 2.

(d) Step 5: Preliminary Strategic Analysis

        (i)     Section 4 of this report presents a preliminary strategic analysis
                for 4 of the 12 identified sectors, namely: coffee, cocoa, fish, and
                wood products. The preliminary strategic analysis includes strategic
                segmentation, segment analysis, Five Forces analysis and a
                presentation of value chains for some strategic segments, to
                exemplify the first steps in analyzing cluster competitiveness, as
                would be done in a CRI. This analysis on the selected pilot sectors
                aims to demonstrate the utility of the strategic analysis tools, which
                could be replicated by the Government.




                                         48
           Annex C. Competitive Reinforcement Initiative methodology

C.1. Methodology

85. The Competitive Reinforcement Initiative (CRI) is a methodology that combines
strategic analysis with activities involving the participation of cluster agents to
promote a change process. The methodology used for the strategic analysis is based on
the concepts developed by Professor Michael E. Porter, Harvard University, in his books
“Competitive Strategy” (1980), “Competitive Advantage” (1985), “The Competitive
Advantage of Nations” (1990) and “On Competition” (1998). The Five Forces and the
Value Chain are frameworks commonly used in the analysis. The CRI methodology, was
adopted by the European Foundation for Cluster Excellence as a field project
methodology, to apply learnings of the training program for professionals of economic
development.

86. The objective of a CRI is to foster change and involve firms and institutions
towards common goals and solutions. For this strategic change to happen, besides the
strategic analysis, particular attention is paid to the change management process. This is
done through a strong effort to communicate and a pedagogical attitude towards change.
A broad set of tools is deployed like personal interviews, workgroups, and public
presentations.

C.2. Strategic segmentation

87. The Strategic Segmentation of a particular industry seeks to answer the
following two questions:

   (a) What are the different “businesses” that exist in the industry?

   (b) What will the industry consist of “tomorrow”? By looking at the trends and in
       which direction the industry is heading.

88. As can be seen in Table VII.1, the Matrix of Strategic Segmentation contains all
the strategic segments of an industry. The strategic segmentation provides a global
overview of the different businesses that exist in a particular sector, and is not country
specific.

                        Table VII.1. Matrix of Strategic Segmentation




                                             49
89. Each strategic segment is a function of both the product and/or service and the
user or market group that this product/service serves. The strategic segments are
distinct from one another because the Porter’s Five Forces 20 are different; therefore, the
value chain of each segment is also different. As such within a sector, each strategic
segment will have its own value chain (Figure C.1).

                             Figure C.1. Strategic Segments and their Value
                                                 Chains




                         Source: PPD for Sector Competitiveness (2013).

C.3. Segment Analysis

90. Once the different strategic segments are identified in the matrix, each needs to
be analyzed. This analysis fosters to answer the two following questions:

     (a) What would it take for any country/region to compete in this segment that has
         been identified?

     (b) What does our country/region (the one we are analyzing) have? What doesn’t it
         have? What policy needs to change? What investments need to be made?

91. In order to answer these questions, different strategic tools will be used. For each
strategic segment it is necessary to identify the value chain required at a global level, not
country-specific. Porter’s Five Forces and the challenges and opportunities for
development in the region/country that we are analyzing are important in this analysis.
Below there is the explanation of these tools.

92. In order to understand the business identified in each strategic segment, one
needs to draw and explain the value chain required. This means to identify each one
of the activities performed along the value chain and understand each need of resource
intensity and linkage, following the typologies shown at in Figure C.2.




20
  Porter’s Five Forces Analysis is a very useful tool for business strategists. It is based on the observation
that profit margins vary between industries, which can be explained by the structure of an industry –
“Note on the Structural Analysis of Industries” (Michael E. Porter, 1980)

93. Through Porter’s Five Forces framework, it is possible to assess the
attractiveness of each strategic segment in a given industry by analyzing how
profitable the segment is, and which actors have the most bargaining power and
therefore which actors retain the bulk of said profit. Michael Porter posited in 1979
that “the state of competition in an industry depends on five basic forces” (Figure C.3).
The profitability of the segment depends basically on three of them: the threat of new
entrants, the threat of substitute products or services; and jockeying for position among
current competitors (i.e. the three forces on the y axis). The question of who is retains the
margin depends on the other two forces: the bargaining power of suppliers and the
bargaining power of customers (i.e. the two forces on each end of the x axis). The
combination of the forces will make the segment more or less attractive.

94. The last part to be considered of each strategic segment is to identify the
challenges and opportunities for development in the region or country that is being
considered. It means comparing the “ideal value chain” identified with the “real value
chain” in that region / country. The comparison will identify which activities of the value
chain are missing, and thus are the areas of improvement that this region / country should
work on in order to compete in that strategic segment. This will then be translated into
actions, policies to change or make and investments to be made.
