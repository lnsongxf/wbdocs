Table 1: Key Moments in the Development of a Modern Institutional and Legal Framework for
Early Warning for Flood Protection and Management in Japan

 1955          The Flood Protection Act and the Meteorological Service Act required that MLIT (then the
               Ministry of Construction) and the Japan Meteorological Agency designate rivers and issue
               advisories and warnings in cooperation. Required data and information were consequently
               exchanged smoothly. Institutional cooperation was non-negotiable, particularly due to the
               very high public awareness and demand for effective flood warning. As telemetry expanded
               from the late 1960s, and online data exchange became widely available in 1990s, the number
               of rivers covered rapidly increased to include small and medium-sized rivers managed by the
               national government and rivers managed by the prefectural governments.

 1959          In 1959, Typhoon Vera hit Japan and left 5,098 people dead or missing - the biggest disaster
               until that point to affect 20th century Japan. The disaster led to the enactment of the Disaster
               Countermeasure Basic Act, which systematically addressed issues regarding development of
               disaster management plans, DRM, designation of disaster risk areas, issuance of evacuation
               advisories and orders, disaster response, and disaster restoration. It defined the roles and
               authority of the national and local governments, and designated public organizations and the
               general public, as well as financial measures. This legislation facilitated further improvement
               of hydrometeorological services in a more systematic way.

 2001          The Flood Protection Act was revised, additionally requiring the river management authorities
               to designate the expected inundation area, to notify the prefectural governments with the
               inundation area and depth, and to inform the general public as well.

 2005          The Flood Protection Act was revised, additionally requiring the river management authorities
               to forecast the expansion of inundation area due to flooding, and to inform the general public
               with the inundation area and depth. In addition, the revision obligated local governments to
               distribute flood hazard maps indicating expected inundation area, inundation depth, media of
               flood forecast communication, and others. Currently, such maps are distributed in almost all
               municipalities in Japan.

2.4.5 Cost-Recovered Aviation Weather
Services
Cost-recovered aviation weather services are
an important component of both modern and
developing hydromet services. Delivered under the
regulatory framework of the ICAO, these services
are predominantly cost-recovered from the aviation
industry, and many NMHSs rely on this funding
to complement public weather and emergency
management services. They should not be
considered in isolation but rather incorporated within
any modernization project. Indeed, aviation weather
services rely heavily on the public weather training of
meteorologists and (often) publically funded systems
infrastructure. There is usually an interdependent
relationship that benefits both the public and the
aviation industry, which often funds additional
observations and systems on an incremental basis.
Quality management systems are mandatory
internationally for aviation weather services as a
means of quality assurance.

As one of the most advanced national aviation
weather service authorities, JMA issues
meteorological information for both airspace and
aerodromes for air traffic services units of the Civil
Aviation Bureau of MLIT and airlines under the
international frameworks of ICAO and WMO. Among
those aviation services, providing information to
the air traffic management and on the volcanic ash
from volcanic eruptions is a good practice of the
cooperative dialogues with the aviation community,
and of comprehensive multi-hazard approach due to
volcanic eruptions.

 1.       Modernization of meteorological           This summary report on Japanese hydromet services
          and hydrological services requires        demonstrates that hydrological and meteorological
          long-term step-by-step efforts, which     strategies need to take into consideration currently
          should be anchored to well-defined        available science and technology, as well as financial
          medium- and long-term strategies.         and human resources. Thorough strategic planning is a
                                                    continuous and iterative process; special attention should
                                                    be paid to opportunities to reexamine and revise these
                                                    strategies immediately after major disasters, as such
                                                    events usually offer valuable lessons on gaps in systems
                                                    or services. Well-defined strategies should also facilitate
                                                    coordination among donors if support is provided by
                                                    multiple donors.
 2.       Legal and regulatory frameworks           Effective early warning systems require good coordination
          should clearly define the roles and       among stakeholders that have clearly defined roles and
          responsibilities of the NMHS, as well     responsibilities, and streamlined operational procedures
          as those of the public and private        to ensure timely delivery of actionable messages to all
          sector stakeholders who provide           residents at risk, and to avoid multiple and contradicting
          meteorological, hydrological, and         warnings. To promote these effective systems, national
          early warning services.                   law(s) should clearly define the NMHS as the single

                                                    should be in place.

specifically on meteorology and hydrology. These
papers offer important recommendations on how
to design and implement development projects on a
collaborative international basis. WMO provides the
foundation (regulations, coordination for networks,
etc.) of global and regional meteorological services
and the framework for such international cooperation
under the Convention of the World Meteorological
Organization. Both papers also make clear that well-
planned and well-executed fact-finding studies or
missions are essential prior to designing, or seeking
additional financial support for, a project.

This study was conducted in the context of the
Japan–World Bank Program for Mainstreaming
DRM in Developing Countries. The Japanese
knowledge, technology, and expertise assessed
through this review have already contributed—and
will continue to contribute—to the modernization
of NMHSs in developing countries, in particular in
terms of systems, operations, and human resources
development, as well as to World Bank operations.
Interested parties should draw on the experience
of and/or closely collaborate with the WDMB and
JMA, both under the MLIT, as they seek to modernize
water-related disaster management, water use, and
operational weather, climate, ocean-related, and
terrestrial services, especially in the Asia-Pacific
region, through long-term, sustainable efforts.

The World Bank Disaster Risk Management Hub, Tokyo supports developing countries to
mainstream DRM in national development planning and investment programs. As part of the
Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and in coordination with the World Bank Tokyo
Office, the DRM Hub provides technical assistance grants and connects Japanese and global DRM
expertise and solutions with World Bank teams and government officials. Over 37 countries have
benefited from the Hub’s technical assistance, knowledge, and capacity building activities. The DRM
Hub was established in 2014 through the Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming DRM in
Developing Countries – a partnership between Japan’s Ministry of Finance and the World Bank.
