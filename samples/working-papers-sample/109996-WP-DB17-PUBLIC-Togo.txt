This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the rankin g on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

       services of a surveyor to check that property border to ensure
       that it is encroaching on another property. Once the surveyor
       has verified the property borders, this survey plan is then
       stamped by the Cadastre to confirm its authenticity. It will take         37 days            XOF 300,000

        The cost estimate of FCFA 800,000 includes both water

        (i) Water connection Fees of FCFA 125,000 for a maximum length
        of 40 meters using an HDPE pipe of 25mm. If the connection is
        over 40 meters, then it would require an extension of the
        network. Additional costs will be incurred according to the
        diameter of the existing pipe network (75mm to 200mm). The
        cost also depends on the required length of network extension
        and the nature of the material of the pipe (PVC, HDPE, Cast).         84 days     XOF 800,000

        (ii) Sewage - Septic tank: Only a few streets of Lomé are
        connected to a sewage system. Therefore, it is common to have
        a septic tank installed. The cost of the septic tank depends on its
        size (i.e. the number of users). For the Doing Business case study,
        it is estimated that there will be between 5 - 10 users. Therefore
        the cost will range from FCFA 350,000 - 650,000. There is no
        need for an additional authorization to build a septic tank.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

        The sale agreement should be registered with the tax authorities. An
        office of the Office Togolais des Recettes was opened in the Direction
        des Affaires Domaniales et Cadastrales. The sale agreement registration
        fees would amount to 6% of the sale value, plus stamp duties. The cost is                   6% of the property

        Final transfer of the property title with the Land Registry

        The parties or the notary acting on their behalf, can now take the
        notarized sale agreement to the Land Registry and file a request of
        transfer of property. It is added to the request copy of the former “Titre
        Foncier”. The law supposes that the Registry’s authorities send
        employees to the property for a field inspection. However, this is never
        done in practice, especially when the sale covers 100% of the property. If
        the sale covers only part of the property, a field inspection is required
        and usually carried to assess the new boundaries of the Land and update                     1% of the property

        allocated a case number which will allow follow-ups. The payment of the
        transfer tax of 1 % of the property is made and a receipt containing the
        allocated number is obtained as proof of payment. The Registrar will
        then issue an order for the transcription of the transfer in the registry
        books. Once transcription is made, the buyer or the notary, receives a
        copy of the transcription.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                          As Mirage will not be able to settle its current liabilities with its available assets,

                           operating, Mirage will try to obtain the opening of reorganization proceedings
             liquidation    and avoid liquidation. Under article 27, a composition proposal is a proposal

                            with its creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court
                            will convert the proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of
                           the proposal (article 33 of the Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that
                               is later converted into liquidation is the most likely proceeding in Togo.

                                     According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the
                                     proceedings will probably be converted to liquidation. The hotel will stop

                                   Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of
                                   reorganization proceedings. The declaration has to be done 30 days following

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
