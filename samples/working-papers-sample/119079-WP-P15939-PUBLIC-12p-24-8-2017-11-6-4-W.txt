       Community-based management model: Although community management is formally recognized in all
       countries, the majority of community organizations are neither legally established nor supported by service
       authorities. However, the model scored higher, especially on institutional capacity and financing, in cases
       where there is structural support. This would ideally include support for operations and maintenance, financial
       support on major repairs, and access to administrative and institutional assistance and training opportunities.
       Such models are found in various forms, but principally through aggregation or federation of service providers
       and professional supervision. Examples are the Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan, which is a designated state agency
       for backstopping of Water Supply and Sanitation Committees, as well as the three-tier support system in
       Ceará, where i) water supply associations carry out basic daily tasks, ii) activities that require economies of
       scale are carried out by federations, and iii) the state utility provides monitoring and supervision and takes care
       of new system development and major rehabilitation. Community organizations responsible for distribution
       only, with utilities responsible for bulk supply, score better on dimensions of sustainability (Morocco, Ghana).

     BOX 1.   Lessons for Service Delivery Models (continued)


     Direct local government provision: All variants of the local government provision model scored low and were
     particularly weak in terms of institutional capacity and financing. Water supply units within local government
     administrations are not corporatized entities and often fail to operate along commercial lines, without the
     possibility to ring-fence water operations from the general budget. In some countries, the model appears as
     an interim solution (Benin), while in others, more permanent arrangements are found for various reasons:
     i) no technical assistance to set up municipal enterprises or joint stock companies or ii) no clear guidance or
     regulations to delegate to private operators (for example, in Vietnam). Central governments can support
     direct government provision in several ways, such as with technical assistance for i) project preparation to
     ensure demand-responsiveness, ii) tariff guidance and ring-fencing budgets, or iii) legal support to transition
     to other management models.

     Public utility provision: Public utility provision for rural water was found to exhibit the best conditions for
     sustainability, although it is present only in China, Morocco, and the Philippines, where rural villages are
     integrated into their service areas. Public utilities tend to show professional management of water assets,
     are staffed with more qualified personnel, have better financial capacity and access to funding, and
     are subject to monitoring and regulation. However, the rural water sector does not present attractive
     commercial revenue opportunities for such utilities. Obligatory service mandates for rural areas, combined
     with subsidies as incentives, are used to facilitate expansion. Integrating rural areas under public utilities’
     service areas comes with challenges, such as extending billing and collection services and monitoring to
     remote areas, and ensuring an adequate financial position of the utility.

     Private sector provision: This model consistently scored well on financing, and to some extent on asset
     management and monitoring. Private sector participation was found through a range of contractual
     mechanisms, from build, operate and transfer (Bangladesh) to joint stock companies (Vietnam) and lease
     and concession contracts (Benin). In China, community enterprises commercially manage multi-village
     schemes. Private sector provision has also successfully mobilized private equity and commercial finance
     (Benin and Vietnam). Result-based subsidies have been used to leverage private investment. Successful
     experiences with private sector participation emerge from long-term development partner engagement in
     the sector to address upstream legal and policy gaps, support due diligence, provide transaction support
     and assistance to national and local governments, and build capacity of private operators. Private sector
     models still operate at a small scale or are scaling up, and critical gaps need to be addressed to realize
     their full potential.

     Supported self-supply: Ethiopia is the only country with a supported self-supply program. In a few countries,
     supported self-supply is a de facto model, receiving limited support from national entities and service
     authorities (Vietnam, Brazil). This interest reflects the recognition that in dispersed settings, communal
     systems may not be feasible. In Bangladesh, where two-thirds of the rural population use individual supplies,
     there is no formalized support, despite the pressing need to improve water quality. In spite of efforts to
     promote supported self-supply as a formal model, there is a remarkable lack of documentation, which is
     critical to convince policy makers of the benefits of this model for remote and dispersed communities.

       BOX 2.   Policy Priorities to Improve the Sustainability of Rural Service Provision


       Institutional capacity

       1.	 Develop enabling policy and define institutional arrangements and functions for service authorities and
          rural service providers. Specifically:

          •	 Assign functions for postconstruction support to and monitoring of rural service providers and technical
             support to local governments, in line with decentralization policy

          •	 Define clearly the roles and responsibilities of different tiers of sub-national government
          •	 Formalize (a wider range of) management models in policies and develop policies for integration of rural
             areas under service areas of existing utility companies
       2.	 Develop systems with sustainable funding flows for postconstruction support and technical assistance to
          rural service providers, including:

          •	 Technical and financial support, especially with respect to major repairs of rural water assets
          •	 Management and institutional support to ensure that (community-based) service providers keep functioning
          •	 Monitoring mechanisms to ensure that postconstruction support is effectively delivered by designated
             technical assistance providers or local governments


       Financing

       3.	 Adopt a financing policy and implement a tariff guideline for rural water that distinguishes the different
          life cycle cost elements of the full cost of service provision, with:

          •	 Different segments (geography, management model) having a different level of cost recovery through
             tariffs—that is, the full costs are funded through a different mix of taxes, transfers, and tariffs

          •	 Identification of sources of funds and responsibility for major repairs, capital maintenance, and asset
             replacement, combined with earmarking mechanisms (for example, maintenance funds, earmarking taxes)

          •	 Social pricing for the most vulnerable groups to ensure affordability

                                                                                                            box continues next page

         Asset management

         4.	Formalize asset ownership through legal frameworks and support service authorities—when assigned as
             asset holders—in the management of assets, through:

             •	 Asset inventories and asset condition assessments on a regular basis
             •	 Capacity building measures using asset management tools, and the gradual introduction of medium-term
                 asset management plans


         Water resources management

         5.	 Strengthen representation of rural drinking water users’ interests in catchment and local water ­management
             platforms, especially in water scarce areas, through:

             •	 Participation of service authorities and service providers in local water management bodies
             •	 Programs to support service providers to engage in catchment protection and water safety planning

         Monitoring and regulatory oversight

         6.	Develop a comprehensive monitoring system for rural water services, and allocate resources for its ­operation
             and usage to inform planning and strengthen regulatory oversight. Such a system would:

             •	 Include a basic set of indicators to monitor service levels, functionality and water facility condition
             •	 Be gradually expanded to monitor service provider performance and effectiveness of service authority or
                 technical assistance providers

             •	 Be used to strengthen regulatory oversight in terms of adherence to service level standards, compliance
                 with drinking water, and tariff-setting in line with guidelines
