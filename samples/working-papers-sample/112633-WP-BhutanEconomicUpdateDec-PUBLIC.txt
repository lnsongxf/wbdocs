The Bhutan Economic Update reports on and synthesizes recent economic developments and places them
in a medium-term, and regional and global contexts. It analyzes the implications of these developments
and policies on the outlook of Bhutan’s economy. It attempts to make an analytical contribution to the
implementation of Bhutan’s Economic Development Policy and the 11th Five-Year Plan. The report is
intended for a wide audience, including policy makers, business leaders, researchers and academics, and
the community of analysts monitoring Bhutan’s economy.
The Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice at the World Bank has prepared this
Update. Yoichiro Ishihara (Resident Representative and Senior Economist) led the task, with
contributions from Tenzin Lhaden (Operations Officer and Economist). Qimiao Fan (Country Director)
and Deepak Mishra (Practice Manager) provided overall guidance. The World Bank team appreciates
the valuable contributions of the Ministry of Finance and the National Statistics Bureau.

                                             Overview
Bhutan maintained solid macroeconomic performance in 2016. Large ongoing investments in
hydropower projects, and supportive fiscal and monetary policy have contributed to the momentum in
growth. Single-digit inflation, a relatively stable exchange rate, and accumulating international reserves
attest to a stable macroeconomic environment. Rapid growth in a relatively calm macroeconomic context
is likely to continue for the next few years, which should result in a steady reduction of poverty.
Nevertheless, Bhutan’s structural challenges remain: large current account deficits, high public debt, an
underdeveloped private sector, and a high youth unemployment rate. To address these challenges, the
Royal Government of Bhutan is in the process of revising the Economic Development Policy (EDP)
commencing in 2016 and has started preparatory work on the 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP), which will
commence in 2018.
Recent Economic Developments
Bhutan’s economy has been steadily recovering from the aftermath of the shortage of the Indian rupee
of 2012. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth revived from a low of 2.1 percent in 2013 to 6.5 percent
in 2015 (table 0.1 and figure 0.1). A combination of accelerated investments in hydropower, good
agricultural harvests, and supportive fiscal and monetary policy to boost implementation of the FYP have
sustained the recovery. On the demand side, a resumption of credit (18 percent year on year as of
September 2016) has supported private consumption, with services, automobiles, and personal loans
showing strong growth. Investments remained robust in hydropower through construction and services.
Macroeconomic stability has accompanied the improved growth performance. Inflation has been below
5 percent, the exchange rate has depreciated marginally, and international reserves covered 9 months of
next year’s projected goods and services imports. Although there have been high current account deficits
(more than 25 percent of GDP), these are related to hydropower projects and thus are mostly financed
by loans from India.
In 2012, Bhutan reduced extreme poverty to 2 percent, measured according to the international poverty
line of US$1.90 a day (purchasing power parity) (figure 0.2). This is among the lowest rate in South Asia
and is substantially lower than the regional poverty rate of 19 percent. Even by a higher international
poverty line of US$3.10 a day, Bhutan has achieved impressive poverty reduction, from 29 percent in
2007 to 13 percent in 2012. During the same period, expenditures of households in the bottom 40 percent
of the income distribution grew virtually at the same rate as the overall average, and the income share of
the bottom 40 percent of the population remained at 17 percent. Equally impressive improvements have
been made in access to basic services and asset ownership. The Gross National Happiness Survey,
Bhutan’s unique measure of economic, social, and spiritual development, showed further improvements
in 2015. Bhutan has achieved universal ownership of mobile phones and access to electricity. The overall
unemployment rate fell from an already low 2.9 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in 2015, although youth
unemployment exceeded 10 percent.
Outlook
Growth is expected to accelerate during 2016 to 2018 (table 0.1). Construction will start on three
hydropower projects in the next 3 years, and two hydropower projects will become operational in 2018.
Macroeconomic stability would allow fiscal and monetary policy flexibility to keep supporting economic
activities. Given the close economic relationship with its southern neighbor, a positive economic outlook
in India will also help Bhutan’s growth to accelerate. Low global commodity prices and the pegged
exchange rate to the Indian rupee are expected to anchor a stable inflation rate. Although high current
deficits are likely to continue because of imports associated with hydropower constructions, these are
backed by secured financing sources. Projections based on GDP growth indicate steady and continuous

                                                    5
poverty reduction since 2012, the last year for which survey-based estimates are available. Poverty
headcount is projected to fall to 10.9 percent by 2015 and 6.0 percent by 2018 at the US$3.10 a day line.
Risks and Challenges
Bhutan’s main challenge is how to manage the hydropower projects and the effects of the projects on the
economy. The construction and commissioning of hydropower projects is likely to stimulate domestic
demand, which would result in additional pressure on the balance of payments (BoP). To mitigate these
risks, credit growth and international reserves will have to be carefully monitored. Increasing foreign
direct investment (FDI) and remittances will be more important to finance the current account deficits.
The effect of the slowdown of the global economy on Bhutan’s economy is expected to be modest
because of the country’s limited linkage with the rest of the world other than India. Nevertheless,
deceleration of the global economy will be felt through its effect on the Indian economy or the tourism
sector.
The latest debt sustainability analysis in mid-2016 concluded that Bhutan’s external debt risk is moderate,
because much of the external debt is linked to the Indian hydropower project loans. In addition to the
challenges related to hydropower, a large current account deficit, an underdeveloped private sector, and
high youth unemployment are major challenges. The implementation of the revised EDP is expected to
improve the business climate, which in turn would be expected to create jobs, especially for youth.
Bhutan remains largely rural, with an estimated 61 percent of the population living in rural areas in 2015.
The urban–rural gap is evident in many areas, including poverty, food security, and access to services.
Although the incidence of poverty is low, urban areas face a higher unemployment rate (6.3 percent) than
rural areas (1.0 percent). Youth unemployment in urban areas is high and increasing: 21 percent in 2010,
23 percent in 2013, and 28 percent in 2015. Long lines for those seeking public sector employment and
a scarcity of high-paying jobs for urban youth reflect a gap between supply and demand in the labor
market. The country is therefore in urgent need of private sector development to diversify its economy,
building on the foundation that the hydropower industry has created. The development of the private
sector will also help address urban youth unemployment.

                           Recent Economic Development and Prospects
1.   Introduction
Bhutan’s economy in the world. Bhutan is one of the smallest but fastest-growing economies in the
world (table 1.1). Annual average growth between 2006 and 2015 reached 7.5 percent, which places the
country 13th of 118 countries, far exceeding average global growth of 4.4 percent. The investment rate
of 56.8 percent of GDP is the highest in the world and has supported the growth rate, yet FDI remained
at 1.7 percent of GDP—less than half of the average of low- and middle-income countries. In the external
sector, both exports and imports as a share of GDP are higher than the average. However, imports are
much larger than exports, which has led to the current account deficit of 29.5 percent, one of the highest
in the world. Net official development assistance relative to the size of the economy is similar to the
global average, which is not enough to finance the current account deficit. The extent of financial
deepening measured according to domestic credit to the private sector as a share of GDP is close to global
average.

Bhutan in South Asia1. Bhutan is the smallest economy among eight South Asian countries, but its GDP
per capita is US$2,532, almost the same as the South Asian average (table 1.2). South Asia is one of the
fastest-growing regions in the world, and Bhutan’s performance is better than the average, partly led by
high investment. As in other South Asian countries, domestic investment has driven high investment
(FDI is low). In the external sector, Bhutan’s high current account deficits stand out among those of
South Asian countries.

 In the World Bank definition, South Asia includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan,
and Sri Lanka.

Stylized facts about Bhutan’s economy. By positioning Bhutan’s economy in the global and regional
contexts, three stylized facts have emerged (figures 1.1 and 1.2).
    (1) Small but high-growth economy. Bhutan is one of the smallest economies in the world (US$2.0
        billion, 1/100 of the average and 1/7 of the median), but its annual average GDP growth (7.5
        percent) is 13th fastest of 118 countries.
    (2) High investment. Investment of 57 percent of GDP has driven high growth in Bhutan, which has
        been financed by domestic savings and secured official foreign loans, with a modest level of FDI
        (1.7 percent of GDP).
    (3) High current account deficit. Gross domestic saving has not been enough to finance high
        investment. As a result, Bhutan runs a large current account deficit of 29.5 percent of GDP.

2.                Real Sector
Why focus on GDP growth? 2 GDP measures the total value added of all goods and services that
residents and nonresidents produce over a specific period in an economy. GDP growth indicates an
increase in economic activity over the previous period and thus measures the strength or weakness of an
economy. GDP can be measured using the production approach or the expenditure approach. The
production approach sums the value added at each stage of production, with value added defined as total
sales minus the value of intermediate inputs. The expenditure approach sums the final value of household
consumption, government consumption, investment, and exports and imports. In Bhutan, the National
Statistics Bureau relies on the production approach to estimate GDP and then calculates items in the
expenditure account based on available data.

because of its small size of its economy.

Production account. The development of the production account over the long term demonstrates three
structural changes (figure 1.4). First, the share of agriculture fell significantly, from 31 percent in the
1990s to 13 percent in the early 2010s. Second, the share of services increased from 32 percent in the
1990s to 38 percent in the early 2010s. Third, the share of non-manufacturing industry increased from
26 percent in the 1990s to 34 percent in the early 2010s. The electricity subsector mainly drove the
increase, with a smaller contribution from the construction subsector. In the services sector, the
transportation, storage, communication, and finance and insurance subsectors were the main contributors
to the increase. Despite the significant change in the economic structure over the long term, the structure
has remained almost unchanged in the past 5 years (figure 1.5).

Agriculture was one of the major drivers of growth in the 1980s, but its contribution has fallen to
approximately 0.5 percentage points of the overall growth since the 1990s. On the other hand, industry
and services have become the main growth drivers. At the same time, fluctuations in their performance
have affected overall growth performance (figure 1.6). In the past 5 years, non-manufacturing industry
led the slowdown of growth in 2011, and services led the slowdown in 2012 and 2013. In 2011, the
contribution of the electricity subsector turned negative at –1.1 percent, from 1.2 percent in 2010. In
2012, the biggest turnaround came from the financial subsector. Its contribution turned negative at –0.7
percent, from 1.8 percent in the previous year. The Indian rupee shortage and resulting cash-flow crunch
in the financial sector also adversely affected the performance of the financial subsector. In 2014 and
2015, when the effect of the rupee crunch subsided, services (trade and transportation) led the recovery.

capital formation (investment) in GDP kept
increasing, from 40 percent in the 1990s to 53 percent in the 2010s, driven by hydropower investment.
Second, the increase in investment led to the increase in imports. Imports increased from 29 percent of
GDP in the 1990s to 61 percent in the 2010s. Third, the increase in exports from 27 percent to 37 percent
did not keep up with the increase in imports. In other words, the trade deficit increased.
These structural changes did not hold in the 2010s (figure 1.10). The share of investment in the economy
fell from 64 percent in 2011 to 40 percent in 2013 before recovering to 51 percent in 2015. Similarly, the
share of imports fell from 70 percent in 2011 to 57 percent in 2015, and the share of exports fell from 41
percent in 2011 to 31 percent in 2015.

Unlike in the production account, it is challenging to measure contributions of different categories to the
expenditure account, mainly because other items (including statistical discrepancy and the gap from the
production account) are significant. Nevertheless, the contribution of the private sector has been
increasing over the long term (figure 1.11). In the past 5 years, gross fixed capital formation was the
main source of fluctuations.

Importance of the BoP: The BoP summarizes an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world for
a specific period. The BoP is more comprehensive than international trade statistics because international
trade statistics usually cover goods only. The BoP consists of the current, capital, and financial accounts.
The current account broadly measures an economy’s saving and spending behaviors—a current account
deficit means that an economy spends more than it saves. For this reason, the current account balance as
a share of GDP is one of the most important indicators of macroeconomic stability. The sum of the
current, capital, and financial accounts is the overall balance, which shows the change in international
reserves.

Regional context. The average current account deficits of South Asian countries other than Afghanistan
for the past 5 years were less than 10 percent (table 1.4). Bhutan’s current account deficits have been
much higher than those of other South Asian countries, indicating that this is a key economic challenge.
Therefore, it is essential to comprehend features of the BoP in Bhutan.

BoP. The development of the BoP over the medium term shows that Bhutan’s current account deficit
started to increase in fiscal year (FY) 2009/10. Between FY05/06 and FY08/09, the annual average
current account deficit was 3 percent of GDP. Between FY09/10 and FY14/15, it increased to 26 percent
(table 1.5). The decline in goods exports accounted for more than half of the increase in the current
account deficit, followed by the increase
in imports and income (debit).              Table 1.5 Increase in Current Account Deficit Mainly Due

maintained.” Although information on the BoP is available on a quarterly basis, the Royal Monetary
Authority (RMA)—the central bank—publishes international reserves on a monthly basis. The
development of international reserves in the past several years shows that they have been increasing since
2012, when the country experienced an Indian rupee shortage (figure 1.14). As of September 2016,
international reserves were US$1.2 billion, equivalent to 12 months of imports of goods and services and
more than 25 months of essential imports. A critical reserve management challenge for Bhutan was
convertibility between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar, because India accounted for 84 percent of
total goods imports in 2014, which caused the shortage of the Indian rupee, whereas there were enough
hard currencies. To address the challenge, the RMA ensured convertibility between the Indian rupee and
the convertible currencies such as the U.S. dollar in mid-2015.

4.      Monetary Sector
The RMA Act of Bhutan 2010 describes the basic functions of the RMA as “to formulate and implement
necessary monetary policy with a view to achieving and maintaining price stability and developing,
regulating, and supervising the banking and financial system, including the payments system, to support
the macro-economic objectives of the Royal government, bring in international best practices and protect
it against systemic risks, thereby enhancing its credibility at the national and international levels.”
Regional context. There is not much difference in inflation rates between South Asian countries (table
1.6). Because of the exchange rate peg between Bhutan and India and India’s large share of Bhutan’s
international trade, long-term inflation rates between the two countries are highly correlated (figure 1.15).

Exchange rate. The Bhutanese ngultrum is 100 percent convertible to the Indian rupee. “The stability
of the exchange rate peg of the ngultrum to the Indian rupee remains one of the cornerstones of RMA’s
monetary and reserve management policy.” 4 After having depreciated by 4.2 percent against the U.S.
dollar in 2014, the ngultrum depreciated by 5.1 percent in 2015 (figure 1.18). In 2016, the ngultrum has
been stable, depreciating by 0.2 percent in the first 9 months of 2016.
Most people are familiar with nominal exchange rates—the number of units of domestic currency that
can purchase a unit of foreign currency—but nominal exchange rates do not accurately indicate the
purchasing power of the domestic currency, which depends on the relative importance of foreign
currencies and domestic and foreign inflation rates. The real effective exchange rate (REER) adjusts the
nominal exchange rate with the shares of international trade and the inflation rates.

The REER of the Bhutanese ngultrum has been stable in the past few years (figure 1.19), which is
consistent with Bhutan’s exchange policy of pegging to the Indian rupee, India’s large share in Bhutan’s
international trade, and convergence of inflation rates.

Credit to the economy. Strong credit growth has been supporting economic activity in the past few
years. Year-on-year credit growth increased from less than 10 percent in 2014 to close to 20 percent in
2016 (figure 1.20). Of the major sectors, trade and commerce (42 percent increase in September 2016)
and transport (68 percent) have been experiencing especially high growth (figure 1.21). The increase in
transport reflects pent-up demand for vehicles associated with the ban on bank lending to the sector that
was lifted in September 2014. In addition, the volume of credit card loans increased more than 20 percent.
The strong growth of these sectors indicates that domestic demand has been strong.

Demonetization in India. The Government of India implemented demonetization of 500 and 1,000
banknotes in early November 2016. Few indicators covering November have been published. Thus, the
effect of the demonetization has yet to be seen. Nevertheless, given the close economic relationship
between the two countries, Bhutan’s economy is likely to be affected through different channels. If

India’s growth decelerates, Bhutan’s growth would be negatively affected. A shortage of the Indian rupee
would also negatively affect trade between the two countries. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence
shows that the Bhutanese ngultrum has appreciated against the Indian rupee, which would have positive
effect on inflation.

Fiscal policy has become more expansionary in recent years. The degree of tight or loose fiscal
policy—called fiscal stance—is broadly measured according to the gap between domestic revenues and
expenditures as a share of GDP. 5 In FY15/16 and FY16/17, fiscal policy has been more expansionary
than in previous years (figure 1.22), mainly because of the increase in expenditures. Although domestic
revenues (total revenues minus grants) have been increasing in nominal terms, revenues as a share of
GDP have been decreasing.
FY16/17 budget. On July 7, 2016, Parliament approved the budget for FY16/17, which shows that the
fiscal balance as a share of GDP is expected to deteriorate from 1.5 percent in FY14/15 to –5.3 percent
in FY16/17 (table 1.8). The main sources of the gap are the projected decline in domestic revenues as a
share of GDP and the projected increase in capital expenditures 6. Regarding domestic revenues, although
tax revenue is projected to increase by 6.6 percent in nominal terms, the increase falls short of the increase
in GDP. Although capital expenditures were lower than the revised FY15/16 budget, they were high as
a share of GDP in FY15/16. Roads accounted for 18 percent of total capital expenditures.

  “The domestic fiscal balance includes only those components of the conventional deficit that arise from transactions with
the domestic economy and omits those transactions directly affecting the balance of payments. The measure is used to identify
the direct expansionary impact of government on the domestic economy. This has proved a particularly useful indicator for
some oil producing economies, where government revenues from exports do not reduce domestic absorption” (IMF, 1995,
p.10).

6.     Employment Situation
According to the 2015 labor survey, the estimated unemployment rate was 2.5 percent, a decline from
the recent peak of 2.9 percent in 2013. In addition, the number of unemployed fell to 8,700 in 2015 from
9,200 the previous year. Despite overall improvement, the youth unemployment rate increased from 9.4
percent in 2014 to 10.7 percent in 2015 and is considered one of the most important development
challenges in Bhutan.
7.     Macroeconomic Policy Direction
Economic Development Policy. The government has been finalizing the revised EDP, which is currently
awaiting cabinet approval. The revised EDP provides a strategic direction for private sector–led growth.
In this context, the EDP is expected to include measures that provide for an enabling environment for
investment.
Fiscal Policy
     Establishment of the Department of Macroeconomic Affairs. The government has
      operationalized the Department of Macroeconomic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The
      department is responsible for the coordination of macroeconomic policies of different ministries and
      agencies of the government. Thus, it is expected that coordination of fiscal and monetary policies is
      expected to be strengthened.
     Debt Policy. Donor resources fund Bhutan’s large fiscal gap, which calls for fiscal consolidation and
      prudent debt management. To this end, the Cabinet approved a debt policy in August 2016 that aims
      to ensure that financing decisions are prudent and that public debt is maintained at a sustainable level.
      Inter alia, the policy provides for external debt thresholds and clarification of institutional
      arrangements, giving the MoF the mandate to serve as the nodal agency for implementing the policy
      and establishing a high-level Public Debt Advisory Committee. It strengthens the Debt Management
      Division by upgrading it to the Department of Public Debt Management, which will consolidate all
      functions related to public debt management. The policy proposes the formulation of a medium-term
      debt management strategy and regular debt sustainability analyses.
     Revised rules and regulations on fiscal incentive. In 2016, tax incentives (exemptions and
      holidays) were reexamined, with a focus on their efficiency in achieving stated objectives. Many tax
      measures, such as tax incentives, are found to be ad hoc and inconsistent, which has caused confusion
      and inefficiency. Hence, there is substantial scope for tax rationalization measures to improve the
      efficiency of tax measures and collections. The conduct of this exercise was closely aligned with the
      formulation of the revised EDP, which includes several tax measures for private-sector development.
                                                          19
      After ministerial approval, the Cabinet will approve the Revised Rules and Regulations on Fiscal
      Incentives 2016. Recent efforts such as the launch of the online tax filing system of the Revenue
      Administration Management Information System and the computerization of the sales tax
      administration are also expected to help ease the cost of compliance for taxpayers.
     Public Private Partnership (PPP) Policy. The government has developed a clear policy framework
      to enable PPPs in infrastructure projects. Infrastructure contributes significantly to a country’s social
      development. PPP policy and associated rules and regulations (concrete legal framework) are
      essential for promoting more private-sector participation in critical infrastructure projects by way of
      outlining the responsibilities and duties of the contracting government agency or office. To provide
      the framework for future PPP operations for sustainable infrastructure development, a PPP policy
      ensures adequate security for private-sector investment. It provides for the maintenance of adequate
      checks and balances through transparency, competition, and regulation. The Cabinet approved the
      PPP policy on March 1, 2016. The MoF approved the PPP rules and regulations at the end of
      September 2016. The PPP policy states that PPP projects will be subject to existing laws and
      regulations, including those related to the environment, and outlines qualitative project selection
      criteria based on Gross National Happiness goals, such as employment, the environment, and social
      equity.
Monetary Policy
     Monetary policy instrument. To achieve its objectives, the RMA uses the cash reserve ratio, the
      statutory liquidity ratio, and prudential measures and guidelines, including the base rate, as key
      monetary policy instruments. In replacing the base rate, the RMA has introduced the minimum
      lending rate, effective August 1, 2016.
     Financial Sector Development Action Plan (FSDAP): The RMA Board of Directors approved the
      FSDAP in June 2016, and the Cabinet approved it September 26, 2016. It includes many actions that
      are beyond the jurisdiction of the RMA but affect the financial sector. Approval by the Cabinet
      ensures better coordination between the RMA and other relevant regulatory bodies and authorities in
      the implementation of the FSDAP. The FSDAP identifies several high priorities, including
      strengthening the regulatory framework of nonbank financial institutions (such as pensions and
      provident funds) to enhance supervision; strengthening the regulatory and supervisory structure of
      the insurance sector to protect policy holders, raise confidence, and improve access to insurance;
      developing suitable regulation to encourage small- and medium-enterprise finance through banks that
      would help increase access to financial services; and designing a national payments system strategy
      and policy to bring about greater use of electronic payments, including to underbanked segments of
      the population.
     Minimum Lending Rate. In July, the RMA issued a circular to the financial institutions to replace
      the existing base rate system with the minimum lending rate from August 1, 2016. 7 Under the current
      base rate system, which was introduced in 2012, the cost of funds of each bank determines the
      minimum rate below which it is not viable for the bank to lend, but because of rigidities in the current
      system, a new lending rate is being introduced that is expected to encourage competition and
      professionalism in the financial sector. Under the new system, the minimum lending rate of an
      institution would be derived taking into account the marginal cost of funds, the negative carrying
      charges on the cash reserve ratio, and the operating costs of the institution. Once the banks determine
      their individual minimum lending rate, the average of all banks would be the national minimum
      lending rate, below which it would not be viable for the banks to lend, although the final lending rate
      that a bank would charge its clients would still need to take into consideration its credit risk premium,

      thereby giving banks the freedom to charge different rates on their products. The new system is
      therefore designed to provide attractive rates to productive sectors that promote economic growth,
      generate employment, and help limit credit to unproductive sectors. It is also expected that savings
      will be encouraged under this system because depositors would be ensured the best returns. The RMA
      will review the policy every 6 months.
     Credit information bureau. Increased credit information reduces the risk of lending and the cost of
      giving loans by providing accurate information about borrowers. The Bhutan Credit Information
      Bureau (CIB) was established in 2010 and collects and distributes information from financial
      institutions. The current database coverage is 23 percent of the adult population. Since the CIB
      collects credit information only from banks, the data are limited to borrowers that already have some
      access to the formal financial system, and hence, its usefulness in promoting greater access to finance
      is limited. Five years after starting operations, the CIB has yet to collect and make available to
      subscribing financial institutions the credit information from utility companies. To improve the
      availability of the credit information, utility regulators (Bhutan InfoComm and Media Authority,
      Bhutan Electricity Authority) have issued a joint directive enabling utility companies to share credit
      information with the CIB, which upgraded its system to enable sharing of credit information from
      utility companies. The CIB is also in the process of including microfinance information.
     Reserve management. The RMA introduced a new policy on reserve management in June 2015 that
      allows it to convert convertible currency in the reserves into Indian rupees.
     Remittances and foreign direct investment. Remittances (under the current account) and FDI
      (under the financial account) are some of the most-stable financing sources in the BoP, although
      remittances and FDI remain small in Bhutan. For example, in 2015, remittance inflows were US$20
      million (1.0 percent of GDP). Thus, the RMA will formulate a regulatory framework to attract
      remittances and establish a monitoring system to review the effects of exports and FDI on the
      economy, which will be translated into a formulation of targeted policies. 8

8.         Economic Prospects
Economic growth is likely to accelerate in 2018. Growth is projected to accelerate in 2018, mainly for
three reasons: effects of hydropower projects, macroeconomic stability and resulting policy flexibility,
and India’s positive economic outlook.

    through the electricity and water supply subsector.
   Macroeconomic stability and resulting policy flexibility. The recent trends of inflation and
    exchange rates indicate that there will be little inflationary pressure or exchange rate depreciation
    (especially REER) in the near future. Macroeconomic stability contributes to greater fiscal space and
    scope for supportive monetary policy.
   India’s positive economic outlook. The latest India Macro-Poverty Outlook, in October 2016, has
    predicted that real GDP growth between 2016 and 2018 will be approximately 7.6 percent to 7.8
    percent, almost the same growth performance as in 2014 and 2015. Given the strong economic
    relationship between Bhutan and India, the positive economic outlook is beneficial for Bhutan.
The outlook for continued poverty reduction is positive. With the projected acceleration of growth,
the poverty headcount rate is projected to be 1.9 percent by 2015 and 0.9 percent by 2018, measured at
the US$1.90-a-day line and 10.9 percent by 2015 and 6.0 percent by 2018 at the US$3.10-a-day line.
A number of factors pose risks to this favorable outlook.
   Current account deficits. Bhutan’s current account deficits are mainly due to hydropower projects.
    In other words, the current account deficits indicate the progress of hydropower development. The
    inflows in the capital and financial accounts fully finance the current account deficits. As a result,
    Bhutan has maintained an adequate level of gross international reserves. Nevertheless, it is important
    to observe carefully development of hydropower projects and the implications for BoP in the future.
    In addition, monitoring the BoP of the non-hydropower sector closely is essential.
   Excess domestic demand. Bhutan experienced an Indian rupee shortage in 2012, mainly because of
    excess domestic demand that resulted in imports of consumption goods such as automobiles. During
    that time, the RMA was not allowed to convert hard-currency reserves into Indian rupees, which led
    to lower liquidity. Although macroeconomic stability has been maintained, and the new reserve
    management was introduced, available statistics (e.g., credit growth) suggest that private
    consumption has been accelerating. The development of credit growth (especially related to private
    consumption such as transport, personal loans, credit) and the effect of consumer goods imports on
    the BoP will have to be monitored. In the medium term, when large amounts of revenues from the
    hydropower sector start coming into the economy, there might be risks of appreciation of the real
    exchange rate through higher domestic inflation.
   Development of the global economy. Bhutan’s linkage with the rest of the world other than India is
    limited, but a deceleration of the global economy might affect Bhutan through India, and a decrease
    in tourism would affect the BoP.
