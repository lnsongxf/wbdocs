I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Jordan perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
   ▪ General Issues Facing Jordan
   ▪ Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
   ▪ World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
   ▪ The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
   ▪ Working with the World Bank Group
   ▪ The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Jordan
   ▪ Citizen Voice: Government Accountability
   ▪ Citizen Voice: Service Delivery
   ▪ Subsidy Reform
   ▪ Private Sector
   ▪ Refugees
   ▪ Communication and Information Sharing
   ▪ Demographic Information

II. Methodology
From June to August 2016, 318 stakeholders of the WBG in Jordan were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 85 stakeholders participated in the
survey (27% response rate).
Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via mail or email. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Jordan; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Jordan; citizen voice: government accountability; citizen voice: service
delivery; subsidy reform; private sector; refugees, and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

II. Methodology (continued)
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 52%, N=132). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 111).

        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Jordan and the extent to which
        the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Jordan, and significantly, moderately
        correlated with the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s development

   subsidy reform in Jordan? (Choose only ONE response)                                             (N=79)
A reduction in energy subsidies ultimately will help the poor because it will lead
                                                                                                    46.8%
to fiscal savings which would generate resources for government social spending.
A reduction in energy subsidies will ultimately hurt the poor because it will lead
to higher consumer prices of energy, resulting in a larger portion of household                     53.2%
income spent on energy and other necessary household expenditures avoided.

    following statements are most convincing? (Choose no more than TWO)                (Responses Combined; N=79)
 Energy subsidy reform could lead to fiscal savings and make funds available for

 Energy subsidy reform could lead to greater efficiency, conservation and
                                                                                                    29.1%

 Energy subsidy reform could lead to smarter practices in industry and
 manufacturing (i.e., moving away from capital intensive industry to light                          22.8%

 None of the statements above. I do not believe that energy subsidy reform in

 Energy subsidy reform could lead to lower traffic congestion and urban pollution
                                                                                              15.4%                   0.0%              21.1%              11.1%            15.0%

 Energy subsidy reform could lead to smarter agriculture practices (particularly as

 Energy subsidy reform could lead to smarter practices in industry and
 manufacturing (i.e., moving away from capital intensive industry to light                    30.8%                  28.6%              10.5%              22.2%            30.0%

 Energy subsidy reform could lead to greater efficiency, conservation and
                                                                                              23.1%                  28.6%              15.8%              44.4%            30.0%

 Energy subsidy reform could lead to fiscal savings and make funds available for
                                                                                              61.5%                  42.9%              52.6%              77.8%            55.0%

 None of the statements above. I do not believe that energy subsidy reform in

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 117 • FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 67

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 I2. Which of the following statements best represents your views of energy subsidy reform in Jordan?
 (Choose only ONE response)
      A reduction in energy subsidies ultimately will help the poor because it will lead to fiscal savings which would
  1
      generate resources for government social spending.
      A reduction in energy subsidies will ultimately hurt the poor because it will lead to higher consumer prices of
  2   energy, resulting in a larger portion of household income spent on energy and other necessary household
      expenditures avoided.


 I3. When thinking about energy subsidy reform in Jordan, which TWO of the following statements are
 most convincing?
  1   Energy subsidy reform could lead to lower traffic congestion and urban pollution (improving health of cities).
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to smarter agriculture practices (particularly as related to irrigation, water
  2
      use, etc.)
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to smarter practices in industry and manufacturing (i.e., moving away from
  3
      capital intensive industry to light manufacturing).
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to greater efficiency, conservation and therefore have a positive impact on
  4
      climate change.
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to fiscal savings and make funds available for more important social spending
  5
      (e.g., education, health, social protection).
      None of the statements above. I do not believe that energy subsidy reform in Jordan will have a positive impact
  6
      on this country.
