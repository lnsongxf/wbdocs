      BOX 2.1.   Promoting Ownership of Water Sources: CBM


      CBM, a civil society organization working toward the empowerment of persons with disabilities, has worked
      with counterparts in Niger to develop “survival yards” for persons with disabilities. The organizations
      worked with persons with disabilities and their families to develop gardens of 25 square meters along with
      digging wells and water canals for irrigation. These sources supplied water to gardens, boosting food
      production and livestock rearing. In addition, the wells and water canals became a source of water for
      neighbors and others in the village, showcasing the economic contribution and productivity of individuals
      with disabilities.

      CBM and its local partners further supported the design and provision of simple adaptations to ensure that
      persons with disabilities could use the water supply and work in their gardens. For example, for persons
      who are blind, the project team developed a bucket that, when filled with water, would automatically tip
      over into a basin, which would further pour into a canal for irrigation.

       Since 1990, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has initiated and funded AgrAbility, a program to support
       the gainful employment and occupational participation of agricultural workers with disabilities, through the
       AgrAbility project. The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds a national Agrability project as well as state-
       and regional-level AgrAbility projects. AgrAbility projects provide information, direct support, and technical
       assistance to agricultural workers with disabilities and their families. Examples of activities funded by
       AgrAbility projects include the following:

       BOX 3.1. Disability Data Collection in Poverty Diagnostic of the Water Supply, Sanitation, and
       Hygiene Sector in Tajikistan


       The Household WASH Survey, conducted as part of the Poverty Diagnostic of the Water Supply, Sanitation,
       and Hygiene Sector in Tajikistan, used the short set of questions from the Washington Group on Disability
       Statistics to identify households with members with disabilities, and included questions to assess their
       access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) resources.

       The resulting data point to the prevalence of functional difficulties in the population. Of the 3,019
       households interviewed for the WASH survey, about 55 percent, or 1,673 households, reported having at
       least one household member with one or more functional disability, at various severity levels. This includes
       persons with mild levels of disability, but reflects how common functional difficulties (including walking,
       climbing, and self-care) are in the population, and bolsters the argument about the numbers of persons
       who benefit when WASH resources are designed to be easier to use.

       Of the sampled households, 9 percent indicated that they have at least one household member who has
       one or more of the six functional disabilities at the highest severity level. The most common type of
       disability is being unable to perform self-care (6.6 percent), followed by being unable to walk or climb
       (4.5 percent).


                                                                                                box continues next page

        The survey results offer further insights into the challenges or constraints for household members with
        disabilities in accessing water resources:

        •	 About 24 percent of the households reported that persons with disabilities in their household can-
           not access the main water source without assistance from others; a higher number of rural households
           (29 percent) reported this issue as compared with urban households (12 percent).

        •	 Fourteen percent reported that persons with disabilities in their household have some or a lot of difficulty
           in accessing the main water source.

        •	 The most commonly cited barriers were distance to the water source (17 percent), carrying or transport-
           ing water (11 percent), lack of accessibility features such as ramps (12 percent), and difficulty of terrain
           (9 percent).

        This analysis is a step toward filling the data gap on WASH access for persons with disabilities. The findings
        can inform future water investments in Tajikistan.

        BOX 3.2.   Obtaining Disability Disaggregated Data


        •	 Ensure that household surveys can be disability disaggregated
        •	 Include disability disaggregation in baseline and evaluation surveys
        •	 Use indicators on persons with disabilities
        •	 Include questions on physical and environmental barriers in WASH or other relevant surveys

An audit of the accessibility and safety of any physical
environment (including WASH, farming and irrigation,
resources for flood management, and other physical
facilities relevant to water use) for persons with dis-
abilities helps to identify obstacles and barriers to
independent access. The audit also flags safety con-
cerns. Access audits are conducted by a team com-
prised of end users, including testers with disabilities
and experts on accessible design standards and specifi-
cations. It is essential to include local experts and end
users in access audits to ensure that the audits are
grounded in user needs and cultural sensitivity. In
addition, the audit should not focus only on specific
types of disabilities but use a cross-disability approach.

Audits can help identify access barriers for all mem-
bers in a community, such as older persons, and not
only persons with disabilities. Access audits help to
identify safety concerns that are especially relevant
for  women.  Women with disabilities may face
heightened safety  risks in accessing water and

        BOX 3.3.   Cost of Barrier-Free Design in Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene


        Accessible and barrier-free construction is always most cost-effective when accessibility requirements are
        built into the initial design. Retrofitting is costlier. Studies show that the additional cost of access features,
        when considered right from the start, is within 1 to 3 percent of the total cost of construction.

        The Water, Engineering, and Development Centre’s (WEDC’s) costing data from the construction of accessible
        school latrines in Ethiopia in 2009–10 showed that costs for access features were between 2 and 3 percent of
        the total construction cost. A single block ventilated improved pit latrine of eight cubicles in an urban school
        cost US$7,242.92, which included US$216.15 for access features (ramps, widened doors, support rails, and
        raised toilet seats). A single block dry pit latrine of eight cubicles in a rural school cost US$9,108.97, which
        included US$228.94 for access features (ramps, widened doors and cubicles, and support rails).

        The costs of making individual household latrines accessible through SBM India range from US$132.38 to
        US$173.05 (including features such as handrails, grab bars, ramps, painting, and advance road).

        When access features are included from the start, the entire design could be developed to minimize
        additional costs of material or labor.

        Many adaptations and assistive aids to facilitate access are low cost and include do-it-yourself solutions.
        The Compendium of Accessible WASH Technologies, by WEDC, WaterAid, and Share, offers a cost range for
        each recommended design feature. (The annex in this Guidance Note provides a list of toolkits.)

       BOX 3.4. Case Study: The Government of India’s Initiatives to Improve Accessible Water and
       Sanitation Resources


       In October 2014, the Prime Minister of India launched the Swacch Bharat Mission to accelerate efforts
       for universal sanitation. With 8.3 percent of the households in India having members with disabilities,
       accessibility is one of the focus areas under the Swacch Bharat Mission. The rural sub-mission Swacch Bharat
       (Gramin) commissioned WaterAid India to develop the Handbook on Accessible Household Sanitation
       Facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PwD).a The handbook is a practical guide for a range of water,
       sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) stakeholders—government officials, engineers, representatives of
       Panchayati Raj institutions, WASH sector professionals, disabled persons’ organizations, and other civil
       society members—in designing and implementing needs-responsive solutions at the household level.
       The handbook offers guidance for actions at the state, district, village, and panchayat levels, along with
       technical specifications for sanitation facilities. It includes model and replicable solutions implemented
       in Jharkhand.

       In parallel, the Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan), launched by the Department of
       Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE), is
       promoting universal accessibility for persons with disabilities. As part of the campaign, MSJE has released
       Practitioners Manual: Making Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Accessible and Safe through improved Planning
       and Design.b The manual, developed by the Samarthyam National Centre for Accessible Environments,
       is a comprehensive document that covers the social and legislative context for accessible WASH.

                                                                                                  box continues next page

        The manual provides detailed technical specifications on WASH planning, design, and implementation.
        The manual covers design standards, including appropriate materials, signage, and low-cost assistive aids.
        It further includes a section on child-friendly facilities in schools and community sanitation. The manual
        provides a checklist that can be used in WASH access audits.

      BOX 3.5.   Role for Community-Based Rehabilitation in Accessible Water Operations


      Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) organizations can play a key role in promoting access to water
      resources. The World Health Organization initiated CBR in the 1970s as a strategy to address rehabilitation
      needs in developing countries, particularly in remote and rural areas that lacked human and material
      resources in medical rehabilitation. The fundamental principle in CBR is building the capacity of local
      communities and families to address the needs of persons with disabilities. CBR has now transformed from a
      medical model approach to a rights-based process for empowerment, social inclusion, and service delivery.
      CBR practitioners can conduct needs assessments at the household and community levels, developing
      customized solutions, using and making low-cost adaptations, and coordinating ongoing assessments
      and maintenance.

      For example, Mobility India, a nonprofit organization in Bengaluru, India, partnered successfully with
      government officials to use CBR approaches for inclusive water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Mobility
      India leveraged existing community networks and self-help groups to reach out to persons with disabilities.
      Mobility India used street plays and wall paintings to share awareness about good WASH practices. Mobility
      India was also able to raise external funding that supplemented government grants secured by families to
      build accessible WASH facilities.

        BOX 4.1.   Mainstreaming Case Study: Disability-Inclusive Development in Indonesia

        The Penyediaan Air Minum dan Sanitasi Berbasis Masyarakat or Community-Based Water Supply and
        Sanitation Project (PAMSIMAS AF) in Indonesia is working to increase access to improved water and
        sanitation facilities and improved hygiene behaviors among low-income rural and peri-urban populations.
        The project is co-financed by the Government of Indonesia, World Bank, and Australian Agency for
        International Development (AusAID).

        Triggered by AusAID’s requirement to ensure inclusion of persons with disabilities as beneficiaries of
        development financing, the World Bank task team is supporting the Government of Indonesia in exploring
        mechanisms to mainstream disability across project activities. PAMSIMAS has introduced a disability-
        inclusive approach into its operations since November 2016, and is focused on mainstreaming disability
        across project activities. Disability is specifically included as part of vulnerable groups as defined in the
        project environmental and social safeguard technical guidelines.

       Implementing the twin-track approach to disability inclusion. Disability-inclusive programming is now part of
       PAMSIMAS strategy and implementation. The main elements include the following:

       •	 Institutionalizing disability inclusion in the project cycle and mainstreaming disability in project policies
       •	 Addressing disability inclusion starting from the community planning process
       •	 Including persons with disabilities in decision making and local institutions
       •	 Encouraging disabled persons’ organizations (DPOs) to facilitate the process when specific attention is needed
       •	 Developing disability-inclusive development training material for communities, and improving technical
           specification standards for accessibility, especially for school sanitation, hand-washing facilities, and public
           facilities

       •	 Updating community awareness and socialization materials
       •	 Implementing a community action plan review checklist at the district level that includes disability inclu-
           sion requirements

       •	 Encouraging local financing to support disability-inclusive development in community action plans.
       Disability-inclusive development trainings. The project hired CBM Australia to conduct a training on disability
       inclusion in development activities broadly and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), for government
       officials, World Bank staff, and WASH facilitators. Fifty-five participants across different stakeholder groups
       attended the training. CBM Australia compiled the complementary Handbook on Inclusive WASH in Indonesia,
       which provides guidance based on the WASH program approaches used by PAMSIMAS, such as Community-
       Led Total Sanitation, Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation, and Sanitation Marketing. In
       addition, the project is socializing and training project stakeholders at the national and provincial levels, a
       district consultant team, and community facilitators in the planning process.

       Community implementation training. After the national training, PAMSIMAS included the topic of disability
       inclusion in community implementation training for facilitators, reaching about 4,200 individuals.

       Pilot projects in 200 villages. PAMSIMAS has initiated pilot projects on disability-inclusive WASH. Following
       the disability-inclusive community implementation training, facilitators identified 200 villages where pilots
       will be conducted. As part of the process, the project team is conducting reviews of the proposed technical
       design for villages in the pilot program (figure B4.1.1) reviews of 35 villages have been completed so far. The
       results of the reviews will be shared with local DPOs in a workshop, to obtain their feedback, which will be
       provided to the community facilitators team.

       Monitoring. Disability will be added as part of the process and outputs monitoring, including by uploading
       the information onto the web-based management information system (baseline population, existing access,
       participation in the community meetings, and beneficiaries).
