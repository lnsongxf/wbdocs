                                                               INTRODUCTION

                                                              Housing Construction
Indonesia has experienced a number of natural disasters in the recent past that have dam-
aged or destroyed large numbers of residential housing. Major reconstruction efforts by
local, national and international agencies were initiated, and because of many homeless
families, speedy completion was an important factor.
The need for speed can sometimes lead to low quality workmanship. However, it has been
shown that poor construction techniques waste materials, time and efforts; they may make
the house uncomfortable, and at the worst, may cause the structure to be unsafe. Costly
repairs and early replacement are serious consequences of poor construction practice.
On the other hand, good quality housing makes for happy occupants, and has important
economic benefits in terms of a longer lifespan and savings in materials and construction
costs. If a house is well built, the owners are also much more likely to make further invest-
ments in expanding and improving their basic core houses.
A lot has been learned in the many recent reconstruction projects, in terms of both, good
and bad examples of house construction. While the bad examples are obvious and speak
for themselves, the good examples show how much can be achieved by making serious
efforts, using good experience, common sense and some technical training.
Considering the above mentioned, this book is made to complete the existing standard
manual for housing that have been published by the government or other institution. The
book presented is simple and easy to understand because each picture are complimented
by simple explanation.

It is also hoped that the book will be used not only for disaster reconstruction programs
but that housing construction in general will benefit from the good and bad practice ex-
amples that are being presented. The book is intended not only for builders, contractors
and their technical staff, but should also be perused by bureaucrats, managers, staff of mul-
tilateral and bilateral assistance agencies, international and Indonesian NGOs active in the
housing and community sectors, and lastly but not least, the beneficiaries themselves.
Hence, the book should be distributed widely and should be made available to all who ask
for a copy; it could also be adapted for training in house construction.

    •	   Set the top of the boards level with the finished floor

•	     The quality of concrete depends on the correct proportions of all ingredients, i.e.
       cement, sand, aggregates and water.
•	     Not enough cement in the mix makes weak, low strength concrete
•	     Too much water also makes poor quality concrete
•	     It is important to measure and add gravel and sand separately for making dense
       concrete of good quality

     •	    Check steel reinforcement
     •	    Use continuous formwork for the entire column

                                               Why ?

     •	    The strength of a concrete column increases with the size of its cross section.
     •	    A column that is too long relative to its cross section can buckle under heavy
           loads.

                                          Why is it better ?

      ••      The wires are installed in a duct and laid in the plaster
      ••      The safety risk is reduced to a minimum


                                              Alternative:
      ••      There’s never an alternative to a safe electrical installation

                         Never penetrate a beam with a larger pipe


                                    How can I do it better ?

••     Never penetrate beams with any larger pipe to avoid weakening the beam
••     Set water and sanitation pipes below natural ground level
••     Cross foundation about 60cm below ground level


                                            WHY ?
••     Do NOT weaken the strength of a concrete beam – it is an important element of
       the earthquake-proof structure
••     Pipes laid below ground are better protected against damage or destruction

                                       Why is it better ?

      ••    The two chambers partially treat (clean) the waste water
      ••    Chamber with settled sludge must be pumped out regularly (when full)
      ••    Access  manhole is essential for inspection and pumping out
      ••    Vent pipe is needed
      ••    Remove formwork of tank cover


                                          Alternative:
      ••    Direct connection to a sewer system – if available
