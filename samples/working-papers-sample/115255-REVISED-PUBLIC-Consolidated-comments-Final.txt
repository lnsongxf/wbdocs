               Independent Consultant on International Taxation and the Extractive Industries

                                                         April 2017


Alexandra Readhead welcomes the opportunity to comment on the draft OECD Toolkit for Addressing
Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses ('Toolkit"). Alexandra is an
independent advisor on international taxation and the extractive industries. Her work focuses on issues
of tax avoidance and other forms of illicit financial flows by multinational extractive'companies in Africa.
Alexandra has authored and co-authored a range of policy reports and guidelines, including the first
reference book for tax practitioners on transfer pricing in mining. She has advised a number of African
tax authorities, Parliamentary Committees, and regional assemblies on strengthening legal frameworks
against abusive transfer pricing in the mining sector.


1.Transfer Pricing Issues in Commodity Transactions


The Toolkit refers to the OECD Mineral Product Pricing Guidance, which is a vital contribution to the
knowledge base of resource-rich developing country tax authorities seeking to tackle underpricing of
related party mineral sales. However, the Toolkit diminishes this practical contribution by reasserting
the need for comparability adjustments to quoted prices (e.g. adjustments for quality, contractual
terms, transportation, and insurance.) Such adjustments may not be possible for developing country
tax authorities that lack the facilities to test mineral grade and quality, and the power to prevail upon
offshore related parties to provide the necessary documentation.


Verifying the quality of mineral exports is difficult for many developing country tax authorities: it
requires a laboratory with sufficient technical and financial capacity. In a recent study of transfer pricing
challenges in the mining sector in Africa, Tanzania was found to be the only country out of five to have
the full equipment needed to assess the quality and grade of mineral exports.1 Consequently, tax
authorities are unable to verify adjustments made by companies to the quoted price. This may result
in significant loss of revenue. To assess adjustments for contractual terms, tax authorities may need to
compare the mine offtake agreement against third party supply contracts usually held offshore by a
related party marketing hub. Many developing country tax authorities find it difficult to reach into the
group structure of multinationals to insist on this level of information.2 These are some of the basic
challenges that developing country tax authorities encounter when trying to conduct comparability
analyses to benchmark related party mineral sales.


Therefore, the Toolkit should give more weight to exploring the "sixth method" as an alternative
approach to pricing commodity transactions. The experience of Latin American countries would be
particularly instructive here. Zambia is the only African country to have adopted the sixth method. A

                                                                                                                             1

                                                              1
new study indicates that both the Zambian Revenue Authority (ZRA), and mining companies, have had
a positive experience of the sixth method. Company representatives referred to it as a "pragmatic
approach" which has made ZRA's tax treatment of sales revenue more predictable.3


The Toolkit proposes the 'netback approach' as another method for adjusting the quoted price of an
intermediate product, where a known arm's length price is available for the refined version of the
product. To apply the netback approach, it may be necessary to evaluate treatment and refining costs
(TC/RCs) paid to related smelters and refineries. To avoid the need for complex comparability analyses,
the Toolkit should flag the option of benchmarking TC/RCs, and legislating simple percentage
deductions. TC/RCs are generally small and consistent, and there is reasonable price transparency. This
approach would reduce the need for comparability analyses by capping refining and treatment charges
that may otherwise be used to reduce the tax base.


Recommendations:


1.1 Prescriptive approaches to pricing commodities should be covered in more detail in the Toolkit, or in
    follow up materials. The Latin American experience of the sixth method should be explored so that
     developing countries can weigh the pros and cons of such an approach. The OECD should use the
     Mineral Product Pricing Guidance work to inform the development of specific pricing formulas to
     be included in domestic legislation.


1.2 The Toolkit should call on international partners to support resource-rich developing countries to
    establish mineral testing facilities, collaborate with existing regional facilities, or contract private
    assaying firms.


1.3 Further work is required to benchmark treatment and refining costs in the case of intermediate
     mineral products. This would be a useful addition to the Mineral Product Pricing Guidance.



2. Addressing the Difficulties in Performing Comparability Analyses


In the current environment where the OECD guidelines govern international transfer pricing
arrangements, developing countries have had to establish the legal rules, capacities, and institutions
required to implement the arm's length principle as best as possible. Therefore, it is appropriate that
the Toolkit explore how developing countries can strengthen comparability analyses to apply transfer
pricing rules. There are many pragmatic proposals in the Toolkit that developing country tax authorities
should consider adopting. There are three that are worth specific mention:


    •    Tax authorities may use information from local tax filings to inform risk assessment, and
         potentially audits, as well as the development of safe harbours. This is particularly appropriate
         given the prohibitively high cost of commercial transfer pricing databases, as well as the
         geographic relevance of the available data. The recommendation to set up an international

                                                                                                                          2

                                                            2
            database derived from information collected by tax administrations should be carried out by
            regional bodies such as ATAF with support from partners. Thorough anonymization of taxpayer
            data should alleviate concerns about potential commercial sensitivity of disclosing taxpayer
            information used to inform risk assessment and audit. Alternatively, there is· sufficient
            precedent for tax authorities not to make this information public at all.


        •   Legislating the arm's length range. It is not uncommon for taxpayers to present such a wide
            arm's length range that different points along it have vastly different implications for tax
            revenue. Capping the arm's length range means that tax authorities can focus on determining
            the appropriate point along the range, rather than testing the range itself.


        •   Where there are independent minority shareholders involved in related party transactions, tax
            authorities may treat data from these transactions as a source of comparables. This suggestion
            is particularly relevant in the mining sector where companies are often required to have a
            certain percentage of local ownership (for example 26% in South Africa), or where state
            participation is required. However, tax authorities should be mindful that there is still a chance
            that minority shareholders may collude or be ignored by the majority.


But even with the new proposals put forward in the Toolkit, the comparability analyses are still too
resource intensive and complex for developing countries to implement. This is proven by OECD country
experiences outlined in the Toolkit, let alone developing country experiences which receive little
mention. For example, Box 12 states that a 'number of countries reported that they hesitate to make
comparability adjustments because they believe they lack the experience or knowledge to apply them
and to fully understand the ramifications.' Further support for this position is found in a recent study
into implementation of transfer pricing rules in Tanzania, where the tax authority finds comparability
adjustments information and resource intensive; the Head of the International Taxation Unit said that
"any adjustment can be debatable, leading to complaints from taxpayers."4


Options for limiting comparability analyses in Part 3 are a positive step, but have significant drawbacks.


    •       Safe harbours are regarded as inappropriate in the case of complex, high-risk related party
            transactions. According to the Toolkit, safe harbours should be restricted to related party
            transactions that do not involve valuable intangibles or significant risk. Whilst it is more difficult
            to design appropriate safe harbours for complex transactions, these are precisely the types of
            transactions that present the greatest risk to revenue, and where developing country tax
            authorities struggle the most. Safe harbours for low-risk related party transactions are a useful
            way for tax authorities to prioritize limited audit resources. However, where possible, the OECD
            should lead the development of similar measures for more challenging transactions (e.g. the
            Australian Tax Office's informal safe harbor for offshore marketing arrangements.)


    •       The Transactional profit split method requires hard-to-get information from foreign related
            parties. This is something developing countries find hard to get.

    •    Advance Pricing Agreements (APA) are resisted by developing country tax authorities due to fears
          of getting locked into bad deals. APAs may simplify administration of the arm's length principle.
          However, very few developing countries have entered into one due to concerns about being
          "outgunned" in negotiations with sophisticated taxpayers.5 These concerns must be addressed
          if APAs are to become a feasible option for developing countries. Donors should consider
          providing support to developing countries to design and negotiate APAs.

The best option for developing countries is to introduce prescriptive rules that reduce reliance on the
arm's length principle and limit the ability of foreign multinationals to avoid paying taxes. The Toolkit
recognizes that such anti-avoidance rules represent a valid response by developing countries to BEPS.
However, there is limited space afforded to exploring these measures in any real depth. Developing
countries must be supported to find context-relevant and innovative ways to stop multinationals from
using cross-border transactions to avoid tax. BEPS Action 4, which proposes a hard cut-off for interest
deductions, is an example of the pragmatic response required. Research has shown positive
experiences in South Africa and Zambia in implementing alternative tax policy rules. For example, the
tax authority in Zambia reports that use of the "sixth method" makes it harder for companies to distort
their mineral sale price to avoid tax. "It removes a free kick for companies," says one Zambian tax
official. Developing countries do not have the resources to audit all transfer pricing practices of
multinationals. So, they must avoid getting into unwinnable battles by introducing clear, objectively
verifiable and easy to administer tax rules.

Recommendations:


2.1 The Toolkit should explore in more detail the experience of countries that have chosen to use non-
public information in comparability analyses (e.g. China, Turkey, Mexico). This approach seems
appropriate for developing countries given the cost and relevance of commercial databases.


2.2 Recommendation #7 in the Toolkit (safe harbours) should explicitly include work on designing safe
harbours for hard-to-value transactions. There could be a more specific recommendation for the OECD
Mineral Product Pricing workstream to also cover development of safe harbours for high-risk related
party transactions in mining (e.g. an industry specific safe harbour for interest deductions).


2.3 The Toolkit should call on international partners to support developing countries to design and
implementAPAs. This might be an area where Tax Inspectors Without Borders could assist.


2.4 For reasons outlined above, Recommendations #8 (use of quoted prices) and #9 (prescriptive, anti-
avoidance measures) should receive significant time and effort in future work by the OECD.

Executive Summary


The "Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses"
('Toolkit") provides with a comprehensive summary of the main principles for performing comparability
analysis for transfer pricing purposes. Under Part I, II, and Ill the Toolkit describes broadly the current
transfer pricing rules, comparability methods as well as alternative solutions addressing therefore all
currently prescribed and applied approaches covered by the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations ("OECD Guidelines") and the United Nations
Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries ("UN Transfer Pricing Manual").


The Toolkit confirms clearly the arm's length principle as the general standard for Transfer Pricing. It
emphasizes the need of sufficient level of comparability of data used for Transfer Pricing Analyses and it
recognizes several difficulties that may arise when performing Transfer Pricing Analyses.


However, the Toolkit is providing only limited guidance on ways to improve comparability and remains
reserved towards clear recommendations for situations where sufficient comparability cannot be achieved.


Instead the Toolkit does highlight the possibility to use so called "Prescriptive Methods", notwithstanding
the fact that such methods are contradictory to the arm's length principle and are likely suited to create
substantial disputes, including the risk of double taxation, on transactions between jurisdictions which do
not allow the use of "Prescriptive Methods" and Jurisdiction which request the use of such methods.


The Toolkit indeed addresses many of the challenges associated with comparability analyses. With the
published draft of the Toolkit The Platform for Collaboration on Tax nevertheless lags behind the potential
to pave the way towards a universally applicable set of methods for Transfer Pricing Analyses based on
the arm's length standard.




Consistency with existing guidance and the arm's length standard


In general, a large part of the Toolkit may be used as practical guidebook given in addition to the theoretical
guidelines of the OECD, as well as the UN TP Manual and as such does not raise specific comments of a
critical nature to its content. In that sense the document indeed could be seen as a "toolkit" for Tax
Authorities and Transfer Pricing professionals. In addition, it shows that principally the arm's length standard
should be applied based on the same matrix solutions in all countries and differences in Transfer Pricing

are driven by objective difficulties, and not per se by differences in methodological approaches between
developed and developing countries.


According to the Toolkit, the focus needs to be put on "accurately delineating" the controlled transactions,
and that is dictated by the nature of the transactions (e.g. characteristics of asset or service, functions and
risk undertaken), economic condition (e.g. market of operations, business strategies), and/or factual
circumstances (e.g. lack of data source). Again, from such perspective the Toolkit should be viewed as a
helpful and welcomed document.


In particular, the reflections on importance of the functional and risk profile of the entities involved in all
transactions, including commodities transactions, should be seen as very positive. This follows the OECD
guidelines and current BEPS approach with focus on risks analysis, including financial capacity to assume
risk, as well as encountering for upside and downside consequences of risk outcomes. Also worthy are
comments about the importance of choosing the tested party, and the potentially significant differences the
in outcome of the analysis depending on that.




Secret Comparables and customs data


As for developing countries the use of information collected by Tax or Customs Authorities seems to be
more relevant than for developed countries, it would have been helpful to underline in the Toolkit that there
is not only the question whether information is available to taxpayers or not, but also when this information
is available. Information collected by authorities could be disclosed, if disclosed at all, only with a likely
significant time lag and can therefore not be used for setting transfer prices in the moment when
transactions take place. A clear statement should be made that the use of secret comparables by Tax
Authorities is contradicting with the arm's length standard and can create considerable uncertainty for the
taxpayer.




Access to Commercial Databases


The Toolkit aims to address the difficulties in using commercial databases. Among others two main
constraints have been identified, the lack of local com parables and the limited access of Tax Authorities to
databases. In our view the latter point has nothing to do with Transfer Pricing. It is pure matter of having
appropriate resources available at the level of the local Tax Authorities. It should be noted that the argument
that Transfer Pricing analyses and the extensive documentation requirements are very costly and


                                                                                                                    4

This document has been prepared based on the request of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax. It is only for the
internal use of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax and not subject to further distribution and any publication



burdensome for the taxpayers was repeatedly ignored by the OECD. So, budgetary constraints or lack of
resources cannot be used as argument why Tax Authorities should not perform a proper Transfer Pricing
analysis using commercial database, if such approach would we be the most appropriate one.


The limited availability of local comparables however is indeed a critical point that may impact the use of
commercial databases, and may then require the choice of a less appropriate transfer pricing method
leading to unreliable outcome. On this point the Toolkit could have provided with more guidance and
practical recommendations (please see below).




Comparability adjustments


Considering that the Toolkit aims to address the issues of comparability analyses one could have expected
that this topic is discussed in a more comprehensive manner. The Toolkit rightly recognizes that finding
ideal comparables is difficult and rather exceptional. However, limited comparability, restrictions in
transparency, as well as the need to use projections and estimations is something that unrelated parties
must deal with in all their business activities. Consequently, Transfer Pricing standards based on the arm's
length principle should provide with a framework that allows to deal with limitations in comparability. Such
framework for comparability adjustments is probably even more required for Transfer Pricing analyses of
transactions with developing countries. In this context, the guidance provided on determining the arm's
length range and adjusting or narrowing it via financial ratios is undeniably helpful. However, missing out
the opportunity to transpose the conceptual framework on comparability as provided in the OECD
guidelines into a practical guide for Tax Authorities in developing countries is a weaknesses of the Toolkit.




Prescriptive Methods


The Toolkit, in its attempt to bridge views of developed and developing countries on Transfer Pricing, places
the prescriptive method among "other methods", or "sixth method" in OECD terminology, regardless the
potential contradictions with the strong message on the necessity of a proper functional and risk analysis
given as basic considerations of the Toolkit.


It is crucial to point out that the Toolkit on one side is noticing the over-simplification of the prescriptive
methods however it quite fiercely defends this approach as de facto sort of CUP method as far as proper
comparability adjustments are applied. Arguments given by the Toolkit pro prescriptive method, as:" ... clear
application of criteria ... , ... quoted prices are likely to be most reliable and transparent basis for determine

Moreover the recommendation made by the Toolkit: "toolkit proposes that work (on prescriptive methods)
should be carried out to determine the feasibility of further developing these types of method to increase
their reliability, ... in particular by incorporating a framework for adjustments such as those based in netback
approaches .. " would lead to the conclusion that prescriptive methods with adjustments as proposed by the
Toolkit, in particular netback adjustments for commodities, is at the end close to the CUP method. If this is
the case we believe there is no need to arrive to a traditional CUP method via a back door named
prescriptive methods. Moreover, in practice the developing countries limit the application of adjustments
and therefore the Transfer Pricing governed by prescriptive methods could be often lead to an outcome
that is not in line with the practice in the open market.




Conclusion


This Toolkit is remarkable step forward in providing with more clarity and centrality regarding Transfer
Pricing for Tax Authorities and taxpayers in developing countries. We appreciate this imitative and in
particular the fact that we had the opportunity to provide our views already in the preparation of this draft.
While in our comments above we have mainly focused on points where we believe some improvement is
required we acknowledge that the draft of the Toolkit is a very comprehensive and practical guidance. We
would be very happy to explain our views and comments in more detail in a meeting or in a telephone
conference.

                                 Comments on draft comparability toolkit

Thank you for the invitation to comment on the draft toolkit addressing difficulties in accessing
comparables data. This is important and valuable work by the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, and
I offer comments on one or two points relating to broadening the typical search process, reference to
profit splits, and safe harbour design. The comments are intended to help support the objectives of
making better use of available data, as well as developing alternatives when comparables are not useful
or when the reliance on a comparability exercise can be lifted. In so doing the comments partly respond
to some of the questions raised, but disjointedly and not in a comprehensive manner. These comments
reflect my personal views and have not been prepared on behalf of or at the request of any other person
or organisation.



A. Broadening the Search Process



I.   Broadening the typical search criteria, as discussed in section 4.2 and Box 10 on page 33, represents
     a key improvement in allowing data to be used rather than unnecessarily discarded. The prominence
     of geographic screening may lead to erroneous conclusions that there are no useful comparables,
     and the focus on narrow industry classification codes may serve to diminish comparability.
     Broadening the search criteria is an approach already adopted in practice, but the discussion in the
     draft toolkit may be interpreted as expressing caution about broadening the selection criteria and
     may, pending the' further work recommended in the draft toolkit, seem to discourage exploration of
     how to make best use of available data. Since the potential comparables resulting from a broadened
     approach may appear to be very different to those that may be perceived to be expected,
     endorsement of the specifics of a broadened approach by the Platform for Collaboration on Tax is
     necessary in order to provide greater confidence that the approach can be relied upon.



2.   One of the problems encountered in effectively performing a search for potential comparables using
     a commercial database is largely self-inflicted; it is caused by the elevation of geographical market
     in the order of screening criteria (as Box 7 on page 28 shows and seemingly supports, geography is
     typically the second screening criterion). The elevation of geographical market immediately
     reduces the numbers of potential comparables simply because of data limitations by country: as
     Appendix 4 tellingly summarises, there are over 150 countries that are unlikely to have sufficient
     data to provide com parables relating to their country, yet there are tens of thousands of data points
     for over 30 countries. Elevating geography as a screening criteria tends to emphasise the paucity
     of data for particular countries, ignores the wealth of data that could be utilised, encourages a
     perception that geographic comparability overrides other comparability factors, and perpetuates the
     perception that useful com parables do not exist. In turn, this puts pressure on the arm's length
     principle.



3.   The typical elevation over other comparability factors of geographic comparability as a screening
     factor is difficult to justify on technical grounds. It seems more likely that the use of geography as
     an initial screening factor has developed as a practice for dealing with large volumes of potential
     data points in those countries that are data-rich. In any event, there are many comparability factors

                                                                                                   20th February 2017

                                  Comments on draft comparability toolkit

     for the potential comparables about which very little or nothing is known (for examples, contractual
     terms, components of pricing, risk profile, business strategy, product or services mix, markets of
     customers), yet we are content to assert approximate comparability. It may seem odd that the one
     factor we do know about, country of incorporation, is treated more uncompromisingly.



4.   Further focus on geographic comparability will arise when tax administrations have access to CbC
     data.and perceive the margins reported by a MNE around the world for apparently the same routine
     functions. If geographic comparability continues to be elevated in the screening process, there may
     seem to be something wrong about a MNE reporting consistent rates of return for similar low-risk
     activities around the globe, and tax jurisdictions that seem to be systematically disadvantaged
     through the vagaries of geographic screening may turn to different approaches. Both outcomes
     would be unfortunate.



5.   My suggestion is that even without further research work being undertaken it is not sensible to
     elevate geography as a screening factor above other comparability factors, particularly for those
     countries included in those 150 or so listed in Appendix 4 that will have very few data points
     anyway. If there were something important for comparability about the particular country, then
     this might be adjusted for in the comparable data derived from other geographies, as the draft toolkit
      indicates. This seems to be a better approach than continuing to use a geographical screening
     criterion but extending it to other countries in the region on the dubious assumptions that countries,
     are comparable since they are near each other, and that countries far away are not comparable.
      Therefore, I suggest that consideration is given to provide guidance in the toolkit that initial
     geographic screening in a typical search process is useful only when the tested party operates in a
     country for which there is an abundance of relevant data points that provide an adequate sample
     for further refinement.



6.   In addition, when the local function is relatively low-risk, and therefore somewhat insulated from
     market conditions, and with limited exposure to its working capital (which may itself be limited),
     it is less likely that the local function needs to be adjusted for country risk factors that are effectively
     assumed by the other party to the transaction. / suggest that consideration is given to provide
     guidance in the toolkit that the impact of potential country features on the rate of return for low-
     risk activities is likely to be limited.



7.    I suggest that consideration is given to provide guidance in the toolkit that economically significant
     financial ratios should be elevated in the typical screening criteria. Box IO hints at this when it
      refers to finding potential comparables in other geographies and in other sectors, and the guidance
      should be developed in order to encourage such an approach. In addition, I suggest that any further
      work on reliability of comparables from other geographic markets should also consider the impact
      of potentially greater comparability provided by alignment of economically significant financial
      ratios. In other words, the work should not just examine, for example, manufacturing returns by
      industry classification across different countries, but should look at manufacturers in different

     countries with similar ratios, such as fixed assets to total costs or employee costs to total costs. l
     suggest that consideration is given to focusing any further research not on whether the search
     process starts with homogeneity in rates of return for activities with the same industry classification
     across countries, but whether the process after making comparability ad           justments including
     alignment of economically significantfinancial ratios ends with homogeneity for parties in different
     markets.



8.   Economically significant financial ratios are much the same concept as the diagnostic ratios
     discussed in section 6.3.1, but the stage at which they are used is different. Such diagnostic ratios
     are very useful in identifying the more comparable enterprises in the final set. However, they are
     also useful as a screening criterion early in the process of selecting comparables and before other
     criteria are used which may unnecessarily limit the data available or which may screen out
     potentially useful comparables.



9.   Concern about the elevation of geography in the screening criteria can extend to the elevation of
     industrial classification codes. Where there is a large amount of data to filter, such codes can be
     useful. But where there is a small amount of data, such codes, if used narrowly to focus on product
     rather than on activity, can remove potentially useful comparables. This is particularly the case
     when the search criteria are not aligned with the accurate delineation of the actual transaction,
     which, as the draft toolkit correctly emphasises, is often much more important than the mechanics
     of benchmarking. For example, the accurate delineation of the transaction involving a controlled
     pharmaceutical distributor may show that it markets a small range of specialised drugs, it outsources
     box-shifting to a third-party logistics provider, it assumes no inventory or credit risks, and employs
     a large sales force. To then turn to a database and begin with an industry classification filter relating
     to pharmaceutical goods importer (wholesale) is unlikely to retain alignment with the accurate
     delineation of the controlled transaction. If the resulting supposed potential comparables are those
     of aspirin-to-zimmer wholesalers with large warehouses and distribution infrastructure, significant
     inventory and credit risks, and a relatively small sales force, then probably the only thing in
     common with the tested party is a shared industry classification. The economics of the two
     businesses are far from comparable. Applying diagnostic ratios to such an inappropriately filtered
     set in order to find potential comparables with, say, lower fixed asset ratios, lower inventory ratios,
     and employee to cost ratios aligned with the tested party is like looking for a banana in a box of
     apples, and pretending the most yellow apples are bananas. Starting with a box of bananas is better.
     The accurate delineation of the transaction suggests that the activity is that of marketing, and rather
     than try to turn an aspirin-to-zimmer wholesaler into a marketer, it may be more useful to start with
     marketing activities across all products and to screen at the initial stage for significant financial
     ratios (for example, the tested party may have a low ratio of assets to total costs, and a high ratio of
     employee costs to total costs, both of which may be relevant screening ratios when searching for
     comparable marketing activities). l suggest that consideration is given to provide guidance in the
     toolkit that financial screening ratios can be used to filter data to achieve greater comparability
     with the tested party than can be achieved by narrowing industry classification codes that may in
     practice diminish comparability.

I 0. It would be helpful if the Platform for Collaboration on Tax could be very clear on the ordering of
     screening criteria, and in particular whether it is necessary to elevate geographic screening or use
     narrow industry classification codes, since the results from a broadened approach will look very
     different to some current expectations of typical benchmarking. For example, instead of
     wholesalers of after-market car parts being used as apparent com parables for national marketing
     subsidiaries of global car manufacturers, one may propose more reliably under a broadened
     approach a set of comparables including marketing activities involving mobile telecommunications
     products or kitchen appliances that show relevance to the economics of the delineated functions,
     assets, and risks; instead of computer assemblers being used as apparent comparables for chip
     manufacturers, one may propose more reliably under a broadened approach a set of comparables
     that include food manufacturing and which demonstrate similar key financial ratios; and instead of
     comparables from the same country or region, one may propose more reliably relevant comparables
     from other countries. The direction suggested by Box IO is that comparables for the distributor of
     mining machinery in Country A could be a distributor of building materials in Countries X, Y, and
     Z. All these scenarios are not only possible to envisage, but are being explored and adopted in
     practice so as to make the best use of data. It is not helpful if readers interpret the draft toolkit as
     not endorsing such approaches, and it would be a considerable improvement if the draft toolkit
    made specific recommendations about flexibly substituting broader f  unctional comparability and
   financial screening ratios for narrow industry classifications and geographical market screening.
    To utilise the wealth of potential comparables available in this manner and strengthen application
    of the arm's length principle, endorsement from the Platform for Collaboration on Tax will be
    valuable.



B. Profit Splits



11. The discussion of profit splits in Section 5 of Part III is likely to touch on some sensitive and
    strongly-held views about whether, and if so to what extent, profit splits open a valve to release
    pressure on the arm's length principle based on comparability. On the one hand, profit splits,
    coupled with valuation techniques, can be used to value royalties in the absence of comparables,
    but on the other hand profit splits are a highly specialised method that can be reliably applied only
    in very specific arrangements. As the daft toolkit indicates, a lack of comparables alone is
    insufficient to warrant the use of a profit split under the arm's length principle.



12. Nevertheless, a profit split does have a potential advantage, at least in some types of its application,
    in that it starts with an actual profit rather than a benchmarked profit, although it is true that the
    profit on the transaction accruing to the parties may not be readily computed. Also, when it is
    difficult to bring reliable comparables to bear, experience suggests that practitioners and tax
    officials do try to evaluate a sharing of total profits, taking into account the contributions of the
    parties as best they can. However, the sensitivity arises because this is not an application of the
    profit split as set out in Chapter II of the Guidelines, the bar determining whether there are reliable
    comparables is not capable of objective measurement and may be set too low, and there are no
    ground rules about what principles should apply in evaluating the appropriateness of each party's

                                                                                             20th February 20 17

                                Comments on draft comparability toolkit

    share. There is likely to be additional focus on the evaluation of how profit is shared when tax
    administrations review CbC data.



13. The appetite for using some kind of profit allocation approach is not likely to diminish, and so the
    development of ground rules would be helpful while maintaining a distinction between such an
    approach and the profit split method described in Chapter II of the Guidelines. The following
    paragraphs offer some suggestions that might prove stimulating in considering potential guidance
    for using profit allocations in the absence of comparables.



14. One way of verifying the allocation of profit in the absence of comparables might be termed a
    comparable allocation method. (Seeds of this approach may be seen to be planted in some aspects
    of the discussion of profit splits in chapter TI of the OECD Guidelines, but they have not
    germinated.) For example, suppose there are reliable comparables for an MNE's controlled
    transactions in the European market and that these determine the arm's length profit for the
    European distributors and production entities; suppose also that these benchmarked profits result in
    an allocation of total profit for the European market of 35% to distribution, 25% to manufacturing,
    and the balance to services and intangibles contributed by the global head office. In the absence of
    comparables for the distribution and production entities in Latin America, for example, or in order
    to support the reliability of potentially inaccurate comparables, the allocation determined for
    Europe could be applied to the total profit for the LatAm market. In this scenario, it is assumed
    that the same functions are performed by the distribution and manufacturing entities in both regions,
    or that accurate adjustments to the allocation of profits could be made for any differences in
    functions, and that the functions are entrepreneurial and involve the assumption of risk. If the
    functions were low risk, it is less likely that reasonably accurate benchmarking of the LatAm
    entitles could not be performed, or that their results would be significantly influenced by potential
    differences in local market conditions.



15. Another way might be to draw a not unreasonable conclusion from the inability to find anything
    usefully comparable in the open market for the controlled transaction: the controlled transaction
    with no open market reference should be regarded as an internal arrangement. There are ground
    rules for evaluating internal arrangements set out in the 2008 and 2010 OECD Reports on the
    attribution of profits to permanent establishments. Under this suggested approach one would deem
    the transaction between the associated enterprises for which comparables cannot be found to be
    conducted for the purposes of evaluation within a single enterprise. There would still be no
    comparables available to price the "dealing" but the focus on the location of significant people
    functions, and the attribution of risks and assets, may prove a useful framework for attributing the
    shares of the combined profit to the parties. Sanity checks on profit allocations that are currently
    used are probably closer to an attribution of profit approach than to a formal profit split as set out
    in Chapter II of the Guidelines, and so acknowledging the approach would at least introduce some
    agreed rules. If for no other reason, the potential complexities involved in deeming the transaction
    for which it seems there is nothing usefully comparable in the open market to be an internal
    arrangement may serve to encourage a more intensive examination of what might be available to
    use as comparables.

C. Safe Harbours



16. Safe harbours can in principle reduce the reliance on benchmarking studies and can be designed to
    align with a country's fiscal policy objectives and sources of economic activity. However,
    eligibility criteria can be difficult to determine, and tax administrations may tend to design narrow
    entry definitions that can reduce effectiveness. As an aside, descriptive eligibility criteria can be
    difficult to draft and interpret; instead, just like the use of economically significant financial ratios
    in the context of screening for comparability, financial ratios could also be used to determine
    eligibility appropriately and clearly (for example, marketing spend above a certain ratio to total
    costs would lead to non-eligibility). Nevertheless, improvements to eligibility criteria may not
    improve the effectiveness of the safe harbour so much as a safe harbour which is more universal in
    design, but with specific exemptions. Such an approach, for example as outlined below, may be
    feasible.



17. It is noticeable that the examples of transactions for which safe harbours may be appropriate on
    page 55 all have in common the absence of significant risk. In turn, the absence of significant risk
    means that the expected profitability across a wide range of activities is likely to be predictable and
    stable within a narrow range, and may be less affected by any market differences between countries,
    leading to greater prospects of the adoption of common approaches across countries. It may be
    worthwhile considering harnessing this common feature to provide guidance on designing an
    effective safe harbour that covers all intra-group activities where control of economically
    significant risks is not exercised in the country, with the exception of certain specified sectors which
    may be important for the country's economy or which present other policy concerns or risks factors
    (e.g. mining, software, insurance, as the case may be). This safe harbour would likely require the
    taxpayer to provide supporting material which could include contract terms and a risk statement
    modelled on the principles of Chapter I of the OECD Guidelines. One could spend resources on
    defining appropriate profit level indicators and various profit levels, but such an approach brings
    complexity. If one of the key reasons for turning to safe harbours reflects the difficulty in finding
    reliable com parables, or indeed any comparables, it may be sensible to adopt one-size-fits-all: that
    is one profit level indicator (I suggest mark-up on total costs), and a fixed mark-up rate.



Thank you for considering these comments. I should be happy to discuss further any points you think
may merit development.

OECD and since 20 IO with the UN to analyze proposals and provide constructive comments on
tax policy and administration concerns regarding transfer pricing and other issues. The
development of a broad international consensus that minimizes tax uncertainty, prevents double
taxation, avoids interpretive disputes, and reduces compliance burdens is critical to the ability of
our member companies to create growth and employment through international trade and
investment around the world.

The TPWG is pleased to have an opportunity to comment on the Draft, which addresses issues of
great practical importance to our member companies. Given timing constraints, our comments
necessarily focus more on the key issues for business than on specific drafting points and we
have not attempted to comment on industry-specific issues. We first share some general
comments and then offer some specific recommendations on the Draft.

I.     General Comments
We applaud and support the goal of the "toolkits" initiative, which is, according to the Platform
statement accompanying the Draft, "designed to help countries that may have limitations in their
capacity to design or administer strong tax systems." If well designed and properly implemented,
the toolkits will facilitate the orderly determination and collection of taxes due. As a result, they
have great potential to promote sustainable development by reducing the tax uncertainty and
compliance burdens that currently discourage investment in many countries. This will not only
improve current revenue collection and make more efficient use of tax administration resources,
but also encourage additional investment and the resulting economic growth.
This Draft is an excellent start in many respects. Its recommendations are helpfully presented in
a broad, practical context, with step-by-step advice and supporting documentation on many key
aspects of conducting a transfer pricing analysis. This approach is sure to be more useful for tax
administrations and less likely to create confusion than an isolated discussion of comparables
data. The Draft is also generally well balanced in its analysis and recommendations and is very
clearly written and well organized without being oversimplified.
We commend the Draft's analysis of limitations on comparables data and its constructive
consideration of potential remedies. Unlike many discussions of this subject, the Draft
distinguishes clearly between issues regarding the availability of data and issues regarding the
capacity of tax administrations to obtain and analyze data. It correctly acknowledges that some
data availability issues are structural in nature, such as those related to financial reporting
requirements, the prevalence of state-owned enterprises; the existence of a limited number of
taxpayers in-country, and the need to protect taxpayer confidentiality. The Draft then offers a
series of practical remedies designed to accommodate these limitations.
We particularly appreciate this uncommonly pragmatic approach. The Draft's recommendations
are generally practical and accompanied by a number of helpful cautions. For example, after
acknowledging that "[i]n many cases, comparability data provides information that can only




                                                 18

Page 3


approximate an arm's-length measure of price," the Draft concludes that "[t]his reality means
that all parties need to be realistic about the use of comparability data and avoid the
misperception that comparability analyses always result in a well-defined and definitive answer."
It is refreshing to see guidance that calls for a realistic approach and resists the temptation to
jump to the conclusion that such imperfections make comparability analyses impossible.

This approach is clear in the Draft's discussion of one-sided methods such as the Transactional
Net Margin Method. Instead of concluding that the TNMM is not a viable method because of
comparables data limitations, the Draft generally supports its use where it is the most appropriate
method. It advises against the increasingly common practice of defaulting to other methods such
as profit splits simply because perfect comparables are not available, and cautions strongly that
"the selection of a profit-split method purely on the basis of a lack of data ... risks leading to a
significant departure from the arm's-length outcome." We believe that this advice is principled,
pragmatic, and necessary to prevent wholesale deviations from the internationally accepted arm's
length principle endorsed by both the OECD and the UN and incorporated in virtually all
bilateral income tax treaties.

In addition, we especially welcome the release of this Draft for public comment. We understand
that seven other toolkits or reports have been requested by the G20 for delivery by 2018, and that
work on at least some of these has been underway for some time within the international
                                                                                                 2
organizations participating in the Platform and has even been completed in some instances.
This Draft (together with its supplementary material on minerals pricing) is the first of the series
to be released for public comment. We submit that stakeholder input would strengthen these
toolkits and reports, especially where they relate to practical tax compliance and administration
matters on which global businesses have a unique breadth of experience. It also seems more
appropriate, in this era of increased tax transparency, to permit stakeholders to comment on
guidance under development. We hope that the Platform will release future toolkits and reports
in draft form (ideally with more time for comment) and will make public the texts of any others
that have already been finalized.

II.      General Recommendations

Despite its considerable virtues, we believe that the Draft could be further improved with
additional or modified guidance on certain issues. We summarize these points below:

 The G20 Development Working Group has also requested the following toolkits or reports: Report on Tax Incentives; Report
on Indirect Transfers of Assets; Toolkit on Transfer Pricing Documentation requirements; Toolkit on Tax Treaty Negotiation;
Toolkit on Base Eroding Payments; Toolkit on Supply Chain Restructuring; and Toolkit on Assessment ofBEPS Risks. Of these,
only the Report on Tax Incentives has been published to date, and it was prepared and finalized without opportunity for public
comment. The current status of the remaining documents is not publicly known.

       A.      Enhancing the Utility of the Case Studies
We commend the inclusion of numerous case studies and examples in the Draft. We anticipate
that many tax administrations will readily and frequently refer to these to provide education and
practical guidance to their transfer pricing risk assessment and examination efforts. In fact, since
the need for such examples and guidance is so great, we think the Case Studies have the ability
to become a key resource for tax administrations. With that in mind, we believe the Case Studies
could be further improved with some additional consideration, structuring, and expansion.
We believe that tax administrations would benefit more from a series of carefully crafted Case
Studies that methodically develop across a series of common fact patterns. We recommend that
the first installment of each Case Study focus on a relatively straightforward set of facts that
leads to a relatively straightforward application of a specific transfer pricing method, perhaps
with TNMM prominently featured, given the frequency with which that method is used and its
emphasis elsewhere in the Draft. In addition, the first installment of each Case Study could be
based on the premise that the tax administration reviewed the taxpayer's documentation,
validated the key facts and suitability of the method and comparables analysis, and concurred
that the taxpayer's transfer pricing was reasonable. Subsequent installments could complicate
the case by altering the key facts and/or the selection and application of the method, including
challenging the suitability of the comparables used by the taxpayer. Such an approach would
seem far more instructive than the Cases Studies in their current format, particularly for tax
authorities that have relatively little experience with transfer pricing matters, but also for
taxpayers seeking to apply reasonable transfer pricing analyses.
Moreover, we are concerned that the. Case Studies as they now stand miss an important
opportunity to reinforce the lessons and messages of the Draft. They do not provide any insight
into the question of how to select, interpret or evaluate comparables. Instead, the case studies
largely focus on recharacterizing the transactions.
       B.      Clarifying the References to Recharacterization
It is also important for the Draft to clarify and provide appropriate context for its references to
recharacterization. It is striking that, although recharacterization is universally recognized as a
rare measure reserved for very limited circumstances, every one of the Case Studies involves
recharacterization of the taxpayer's transaction by the tax administration, with little or no insight
into the basis for this action.
This seems to signal more latitude for recharacterization than international transfer pricing
guidance permits. The Draft should provide a more realistic balance, to avoid any inference that
it is intended to encourage broad use of recharacterization by tax administrations. If examples
involving recharacterization are to be included in the Draft, they should explain the factual
circumstances and technical analysis supporting the recharacterization. The Draft should also




                                                 20

February 21, 2017
Page 5

specifically note the limitations on recharacterization agreed in the BEPS work instead of just
providing a cross-reference to an OECD document in a footnote.

        C.     Refining the Safe Harbor Recommendations
The Draft contains a very interesting and potentially very important discussion of the role that
safe harbors can play in transfer pricing. We strongly support the provision of safe harbors in
principle, and believe that they can ease burdens and provide needed certainty for both tax
administrations and taxpayers. However, we also recognize that they need to be carefully
designed to operate properly within the arm's length principle.

We agree with the Draft that bilaterally or regionally agreed safe harbors are generally preferable
to unilateral approaches, both because they are more efficient and provide greater certainty and
because they are less likely to create double taxation (or double non-taxation). However, the
Draft raises a couple of concerns that first need to be addressed.

First, while the Draft acknowledges that safe harbors may be voluntary, it signals a preference
for the use of mandatory safe harbors with a taxpayer opt-out. While the requirement of an opt-
out option is appropriate in our view, the Draft further suggests that the burden of proof should
be borne by the taxpayer if it chooses to opt out. This would be a major departure from the way
the transfer pricing regimes and other laws of many countries operate, and it would limit the
practical availability of the opt-out option in many cases. Without an effective opt-out option, a
mandatory safe harbor becomes difficult to distinguish from the Brazilian fixed margin method,
which is widely regarded as inconsistent with the arm's length principle.

This concern is heightened by the Draft's suggestion that tax administrations may use
confidential "secret comparables" data reported to tax administrations by unrelated taxpayers to
set safe harbor margins. We question whether it would be appropriate to create mandatory safe
harbors based solely on tax return data, because those data do not provide all of the facts relevant
to a transfer pricing analysis. In addition, . we are concerned that, although the Draft
appropriately cautions that secret comparables data may not be used as the basis for a transfer
pricing adjustment, it recommends that the creation of an "international database" of such data
be considered as the basis for tax administrations to set safe harbors. The Draft hints that this
database would "potentially" be accessible to taxpayers, but there is no indication of how this
would be accomplished given the Draft's appropriate insistence on the protection of taxpayer
confidentiality. If mandatory safe harbors were created without transparency or true opportunity
for input, it would, again, be difficult to distinguish them from the fixed margins used under the
widely questioned Brazilian method.

We believe that all of these issues could probably be resolved by simply making the safe harbor
regime voluntary or including a true opt-out option, without a major deterrent such as a shift of
the burden of proof. If designed and administered in this manner, so that the safe harbor is not




                                                21
Platform for Collaboration on Tax
February 21, 2017
Page 6


effectively mandatory and does not become the baseline in practice for examination adjustments,
we would support the expanded use of safe harbors as a practical administrative measure.

          D.       Clarifying the Discussion of Profit Splits and Other Methods

The Draft's discussion of transactional profit split methods should be updated to reflect last
year's BEPS Project discussions, which widely acknowledged two important points:

               •    That highly integrated operations are neither necessary nor sufficient for the
                    application of a profit split method, and

               •    That a value chain analysis should not be regarded as justification for the use of a
                    profit split method as opposed to other transfer pricing methods.

We believe it should also be noted that even the existence of unique and valuable intangibles on
both sides of a transaction should not require the use of a profit split method if the transaction or
either party to the transaction is benchmarkable.

In addition, although most of the discussion in the Draft regarding transfer pricing methods is
very strong, the short section regarding profit split methods based on contribution or value chain
analyses fails to adequately discuss their strengths and weaknesses and the conditions in which
they may be applied and thus lacks appropriate context and cautions. Similarly, the description
of Brazil's fixed margin method and the call for further work on the application of "Sixth
Methods" for commodities pricing should be accompanied an analytical discussion and an
acknowledgment of their relatively limited international acceptance, so that the Draft is not
misunderstood as implicitly endorsing these non-arm's length approaches for broader use.3

         E.        Addressing the Discussion of Anti-Avoidance Provisions
Finally, we note that the Draft contains a very brief but broad statement at the end that "anti-
avoidance measures and other tax base protection measures" may be used in "categories of cases"
where there is a "significant, systemic risk of tax loss, and data is not available or capacity is
insufficient to apply one of the methods discussed." There is no indication of how it would be
determined whether a "significant, systemic risk of tax loss" or one of the other specified
conditions exists.     The Draft specifically identifies several options available in these

3
  We appreciate that the 2017 edition of the UN Practical Transfer Pricing Manual for Developing Countries will contain a
discussion of Sixth Methods but note that that discussion does not acknowledge such Methods as arm's length in nature. While it
is helpful for the Toolkit to include references lo provisions of the UN Practical Manual for information and for the UN Practical
Manual to provide practice advice, it should be recalled that die Manual represents the views of the 25 members of the UN
Committee of Experts on 1ntemational Cooperation in Taxation. who serve in their personal capacities. The UN Practical
Manual therefore should not be taken as grounds for departing from the post-BEPS international transfer pricing standards set
forth in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. which all members of the Inclusive Framework have committed to implement.




                                                               22

 circumstances, including a cap on royalty deductions and limits on interest deductions in addition
 to those provided under BEPS Action 4.

 We respectfully submit that the discussion of anti-avoidance provisions and "other tax base
 protection measures" is, as the Draft acknowledges, beyond the scope of the Toolkit. We believe
 that this section needs to be removed from the Toolkit, so that it is not interpreted as a green light
 for the use of such provisions in lieu of appropriate transfer pricing analyses. It might otherwise
 be read as a "self-help" exception available to any tax administration that believes that it either
 has a "significant, systemic risk of tax loss" or "data" is "not available" or the administration has
 insufficient capacity to apply a transfer pricing method. The unavailability of data due to limited
 public financial reporting, for example, has already been cited by some major emerging
 economies as justification for increased reliance on profit split methods. We are also troubled by
 the fact that the discussion endorses options that go beyond the scope of the recently agreed
 BEPS measures.
 III.    Specific Drafting Points
         A.     Unitary Taxation and Formulary Apportionment
  Unitary taxation and formulary apportionment are addressed briefly in the Introduction to the
· Draft as follows:
          "Unitary taxation or formulary apportionment approaches are sometimes
        . proposed as alternatives to the arm's length principle, which need not rely on
          comparables. While the merits and disadvantages of such approaches can be
          debated, including whether or not they would benefit developing countries, they
          are unlikely to be implemented at global level in the foreseeable future. This
          toolkit, therefore, focuses on practical measures that can be implemented in the
          short to medium term. The issue of a lack of com parables data for transfer pricing
          analyses was highlighted in the Report to G20 Development Working Group on
          the Impact of BEPS in Low Income Countries, which was the catalyst for this
          toolkit." (Page 6, citations omitted.)
As result of the way it is drafted, the statement appears to imply that unitary taxation or
formulary apportionment is superior to the arm's length principle because it does not require a
comparability analysis, and even perhaps that the arm's length principle is merely an interim
approach. We assume this implication was not intended, as OECD and UN guidance has long
eschewed these approaches in favor of the arm's length principle, the Introduction confirms the
centrality of the arm's length principle just a few paragraphs earlier, and the paragraph footnotes
an IMF Policy Paper questioning the suitability of formulary apportion for developing countries.
To avoid any confusion, however, we respectfully recommend that the Draft revise its language
to more clearly confirm its support for the arm's length standard over alternatives such as unitary
taxation and formulary apportionment.

       B.      Working Capital Adjustments
Section 5.2 of the Draft includes a discussion on working capital adjustments (WCA). While
this is certainly a relevant component of transfer pricing practice and guidance, we find the Draft
sends mixed messages that could be confusing to a less experienced tax administrator. TPWG
members support the use of reliable working capital adjustments, because, almost certainly, there
will be differences among the comparables, as well as between the tested party and at least some
of the comparables, with regard to their levels of working capital, and these differences can
affect the arm's length measure of profitability. We feel a more consistent and balanced message
should be conveyed by the Draft, perhaps providing more insight into when working capital
adjustments may and may not enhance the reliability of the analysis.
For example, a situation in which an adjustment for differences in inventory holding periods is
relevant could arise if the tested party takes title to goods from its related party supplier when the
goods leave the foreign port, but the comparables all take title at the port of importation. An
adjustment to reflect that the related party holds inventory longer, measured by the average
number of days in ocean transit, would be appropriate, and most likely could be calculated with
reference to verifiable evidence. Such an adjustment would add reliability to the transfer pricing
analysis.
By contrast, imagine a tested party held levels of inventory and/or accounts payable well in
excess of those of any of the comparable companies. Before making adjustments for these
differences, which could substantially alter the measure of the arm's length range, it would be
appropriate to inquire what caused such high balances to be held. It could be that obsolete
inventory had not been written off or written down, or it could be that the related party had
forced the tested party to accept excess inventories beyond what could be sold or paid for.
Excessive accounts payable could effectively be equity disguised as debt. While these are just
examples, they illustrate that a reliable analysis should not apply working capital adjustments in
an unexamined manner.
We believe that the Draft seeks to convey exactly this message - that certain working capital
adjustments can add reliability, but that they should not be applied without due consideration.
The TPWG agrees that this is the right message, but believes that some redrafting of this section
would help to clarify this. Currently, the Draft has superficially conflicting language, on the one
hand noting that WCA are the most commonly applied comparability adjustments (page 36), but
then further noting, "WCA may give rise to additional costs and complexity out of proportion to
any increase in reliability or accuracy of data" (page 37).
In addition, we note that the discipline of looking at working capital balances and ratios is
important to understanding corporate business models and behavior, and signaling potentially
important differences (e.g., levels of risks) among companies. We believe the Draft should
encourage tax authorities to analyze this information, along with other balance sheet data. We
also note that the magnitude of working capital balances and differences among companies can

vary depending on the profit ratio used. Thus, inspecting these balances and ratios 1s an
important part of a careful transfer pricing analysis.
Section 5 .2.1 of the Draft further observes that a working capital adjustment may be used as a
proxy for a functional adjustment. While we believe that a reasonable review should first be
conducted to determine whether a more traditional comparability adjustment would work, the
TPWG supports the use of this approach where an alternative is needed, as a reasonable and
practical way to enhance comparability in the absence of reliable arm's length comparables.
Such an approach, when applied reasonably and reliably, can enhance the applicability of various
methods.
         C.    Analysis of Financial Data
The Draft acknowledges that analysis of financial data is part of the transfer pncmg and
comparables selection process. Yet TPWG members believe that careful analysis of the financial
data of the tested party and each of the com parables is more important and more central to the
transfer pricing process than the Draft currently suggests. Careful analysis of the data for the
tested party is essential to gaining an understanding of the nature and scope of operations and
how those align with the legal arrangements and functional analysis. Similarly, a careful review
of the data for each potential comparable will reveal similarities and differences from the tested
party and amongst the comparables. It must then be determined whether these differences are
significant enough to require the application of certain adjustments, or possibly, the rejection of a
potential comparable.
For example, in some companies and some industries, outsourcing and subcontracting are a
substantial part of the business model. Some companies that employ subcontractors report the
reimbursement for subcontracting as "Revenue" and the payments to the subcontractors as
"Costs." Other companies in the same industry do not record these amounts as Revenue or Costs,
but instead, report the net amount received on subcontracted work as "Revenue." Without a
careful review of the data for the tested party and each comparable, these reporting differences
will not be identified. However, with a careful review, the companies' data can be adjusted.to a
consistent basis, by either converting all companies to reporting in Revenue the net receipts from
subcontracting, or by grossing up Revenues and Costs to include the subcontracted amounts to
ensure consistency. These kinds of considerations are critical to a meaningful and accurate
transfer pricing analysis, and also strongly affect the selection and application of the PU. Very
different results will be obtained, and incorrect conclusions will be drawn, if the financial data of
the parties is not careful analyzed, understood, and conformed. We further note that Case Study
2, if it were extended, could be a vehicle for illustrating this, particularly as it relates to the
construction engineering business, which typically involves a substantial amount of
subcontracting.
Understanding the financial data permits a more meaningful selection of the PU, as well,
because some PUs naturally tend to correct or adjust for differences across the tested party and




                                                 25

the comparables better than others. The above example demonstrates that a cost-based PLI or a
revenue-based PLI will not be a consistent .o r meaningful metric if costs and revenues are not
measured consistently across the tested party and the comparables. Similarly, if differences are
observed in balance sheet ratios, an asset-based PLI may be a better choice, because by scaling
profit to assets, differences in the composition of assets is essentially controlled for. An income
statement-based PLI may not adequately reflect balance sheet differences (unless the observed
differences can be adequately addressed through a WCA). In fact, the Draft could reflect the
notion that the application of more than one PLI should lead to broadly consistent conclusions.
If the choice of the PLI yields conflicting conclusions about the transfer prices, this should direct
the analyst to look more deeply at the financial data of the tested party and the com parables.
       D.      Foreign Comparables
The Draft comments in various sections on the use of data for companies located outside the
jurisdiction of the tested party. On balance, it seems to conclude that it is unclear whether such
data can be reliably used for transfer pricing analyses.
TPWG members believe that such data has much more utility than the Draft suggests. As the
Draft notes, numerous tax authorities already accept comparables data on companies located
outside their jurisdiction. In addition to the examples cited in the Draft, including Europe, China,
Australia and New Zealand, we would point to Canada, Mexico and other Latin American
countries, and the United States, as jurisdictions where it is common for many (and in some
cases, all) of the potential and accepted com parables to be from non-local jurisdictions. Due to
factors such as the small size of certain markets, the lack of reporting requirements for non-
public companies, and the lack of diversity in publicly traded companies, it has become common
practice for taxpayers and tax authorities alike to rely on non-local comparables. This is a
practical approach to transfer pricing with an established track record; it provides taxpayers with
a sound basis to comply with documentation requirements; and it provides tax authorities a basis
on which to avoid or resolve controversies and double taxation.
Given the globalization of business, any assertion that profitability for a given product or
function in a given geographic market should be materially different from profitability earned in
other geographic markets needs to be substantiated by reference to documentable barriers to
entry, regulatory requirements, or other demonstrable factors. Otherwise, basic economic
concepts suggest that geographic profitability differences will not persist as more competitors
enter the market and bid away these differences. This is consistent with our collective
experience: we find that regional or even global comparables are normally in line with local
comparables and are routinely used by taxpayers and accepted by tax administrations.
We would add that the understanding of data from "other markets" could usefully be further
examined. If a company under consideration as a comparable is a consolidated, publicly-traded
company, its jurisdiction may be identified in a database based on where its shares are traded
and/or where its headquarters is located. However, it may not be the case that all or most of the




                                                 26
Platform for Collaboration on Tax
February 21, 2017
Page 11


company's economic activity is located in that jurisdiction. An advantage of considering
publicly-traded companies as comparables is that their level of financial and factual disclosure is
enhanced. Often a review of an annual report or other filing document will reveal details about
the geographic spread of the company's activities. This information also may describe certain
sub-segments of the company's business, some of which may be more comparable to the tested
party than others. Thus, the headquarters/listing jurisdiction may not be the location of much or
most of the relevant economic activity, and these details should be reviewed before assigning a
company's geographic location (or relying on the assignment designated by a database).

The same is true for private companies whose data may be available in certain databases. Even
though details on their geographic activity may not be as readily available, it is worthwhile to
research this before rejecting an otherwise comparable company, simply because of its reporting
jurisdiction.

        E.      Profit Splits and Comparables
Certain language in the Draft states or implies that profit split methods can be applied without
any reference to com parables. TPWG members respectfully disagree with this view. ·
Specifically, in section 2.4.1, the Draft states,
        "In most cases, the transactional profit split method is applied by splitting the
        actual combined profits between the associated enterprises on an economically
        valid basis (for example, based on the relative contributions of each party). As
        pointed out in Part III, this is a method that can be applied in the absence of
        comparables." (Emphasis added.)
In addition, section 5 of the Draft provides,
        " ... profit splits may be made on another economically valid basis, such as an
        analysis of economic and business processes that are employed to determine the
        respective contributions to profit of each of the parties to the transaction. Such
        analyses do not necessarily apply or require data from comparable uncontrolled
        transactions." (Emphasis added.)
TPWG members are concerned that readers will mistake these comments as a license to resort to
profit splits when they perceive comparables to be hard to come by. Given that the entire Toolkit
is directed at circumstances in which comparables are difficult to obtain, statements such as these
may appear to inappropriately favor profit splits.
Moreover, we do not believe it is accurate to indicate that profit splits are or can be applied
without reference to comparables. The OECD Guidelines provide, "[w]here comparables data
are available, they can be relevant in the profit split analysis to support the division of profits that
would have been achieved between independent parties in comparable circumstances" (para.




                                                    27
Platform for Collaboration on Tax
February 21, 2017
Page 12

2.110). The Guidelines go on to set out at least two ways in which data from independent parties
that are comparable to all or part of the subject transaction may be used in a profit split.

The first relates to a contribution analysis, in which the way that independent parties have split
profit between themselves is used as the basis for splitting profits between related parties.
(OECD Guidelines, para 2.1 19.)         Thus, one or more independent transactions can be
comparables for a split of profits. Such circumstances can arise in the context of joint ventures,
licensing, and the purchase/sale of rights or part or all of a business, as well as in certain other
situations.

The second way in which com parables are relevant to profit splits is in the context of a residual
analysis, in which the first stage of the analysis involves remunerating the contributions made by
the related parties that can be reasonably benchmarked by reference to comparables - either
comparable transactions or comparable companies. The Guidelines indicate that, "[o]rdinarily
this initial remuneration would be determined by applying one of the traditional transaction
methods or a transactional net margin method, by reference Lo the remuneration of comparable
transactions between independent enterprises." (Guidelines, para 2.121 (emphasis added).)
Only the profits in excess of these benchmarkable amounts are then subject to a profit split in the
second stage.
TPWG members recommend that the language in the Draft be modified to reflect the useful
guidance of the OECD Guidelines on this issue. We also believe that the cautious sentiment
expressed in the following statement from the Guidelines should be reflected in the Draft for the
benefit of tax administrations:
       "On first review, the transactional profit split method may appear readily
       accessible to both taxpayers and tax administrations because it tends to rely less
       on information about independent enterprises. However, associated enterprises
       and tax administrations alike may have difficulty accessing information from
       foreign affiliates. In addition, it may be difficult to measure combined revenue
       and costs for all the associated enterprises participating in the controlled
       transactions, which would require stating books and records on a common basis
       and making adjustments in accounting practices and currencies. Further, when
       the transactional profit split method is applied to operating profit, it may be
       difficult to identify the appropriate operating expenses associated with the
       transactions and to allocate costs between the transactions and the associated
       enterprises' other activities." (Para. 2.114.)
More generally, although the last paragraph of section 2.4.1 acknowledges that a method should
not be "easily dismissed" due to "imperfect" comparables, this proposition is stated in the
negative. By phrasing this in the negative (referencing the dismissal rather than the acceptance
of a method), and by referencing "imperfect" comparables (as though "perfect comparables"
were the norm), TPWG members are concerned that the wrong message will be conveyed,




                                                28
Platform for Collaboration on Tax

particularly to less experienced practrtioners of transfer pncmg. We believe it would be
preferable to have affirmative guidance that emphasizes that tax authorities and taxpayers should
make every reasonable effort to identify the best (even though imperfect) comparables and make
reasonable adjustments, before abandoning what otherwise would be the most appropriate
method in pursuit of a level of perfection or precision that does not exist. We are pleased to see
that the Draft notes the various adjustments that might be made, and we believe that positive,
practical guidance should acknowledge that, in most cases, taxpayers and tax authorities are in
equivalent positions, with only so much potentially comparable data available. It is far
preferable to make best efforts to apply the most appropriate method using the available data,
making reasonable adjustments where possible and/or necessary, provided that significant
deviations from the operation of the TNMM or other methods are not institutionalized or used
for procedural advantage (e.g., to effectively shift the burden of proof with respect to a proposed
adjustment). The alternative is to lose transfer pricing discipline altogether by deviating from the
most appropriate method. This is a far inferior result that will increase disputes, rather than
resolve them.
        F.     Box 3 Example
We appreciate that the Draft has created numerous examples to guide the reader in some of the
practical issues arising in the application of transfer pricing analysis. However, we submit that it
is important to be attuned to both the stated and unstated messages that might be derived from
these examples. In the Box 3 example, we find a number of concerning messages that could be
corrected with some minor changes to the facts and language.
The discussion in Box 3 sets out to illustrate that one can obtain different results when a different
TNMM analysis is applied to each party to a transaction. While this is undoubtedly true, the
specifics of the example could be improved. First, we note that the example posits a line of
business that generates a 30% operating margin on a consolidated basis. While not impossible,
we note that businesses that generate 30% operating margins are relatively rare. When margins
as high as 30% are observed on a sustained basis, it is appropriate to ask what circumstances
afford the company to sustain such high profits. There may be unique intangibles or market
circumstances that produce this result. Box 3 does not address this sufficiently or note that a
thorough and careful transfer pricing analysis should elucidate the relevant facts and consider
those in the selection of the method, selection of the tested party, selection of com parables, and
application of these. Because the complexities associated with addressing the presence and
creation of intangibles or other factors generating very high profit margins likely extend beyond
the intent of the example, we suggest modifying the example to focus on a more typical and
modest profit margin, such that "excess profits" do not arise or appear to be unexplained. Even
with a more modest system profit margin, it would be possible to illustrate that the transfer price
may not be identical if the manufacturer is remunerated as opposed to the distributor. At the
same time, however, the example could be extended to show that if ranges of TNMM profits are




                                                 29
Platform for Collaboration on Tax
February 21, 2017
Page 14

used, the ranges may overlap such that there is a narrower range of transfer prices that leaves
each party with a defensible level of profit.

We also recommend conforming the language in the last sentence of Box 3. That is, just as
Scenario I "is more likely to be appropriate" when PenCo Manufacturing undertakes routine
manufacturing activities; Scenario 2 is also "more likely to be appropriate" if PenCo Sales
undertakes routine distribution and sales activities. The current language, indicating only that
Scenario 2 "may be more appropriate" ( emphasis added) suggests different and weaker guidance
than that provided immediately above for Scenario I.
Similarly, we recommend using more consistent and parallel language in the text immediately
below Box 3. It contains a sentence that states, "[f]or instance, where an enterprise assumes the
economically significant risks, including those associated with a unique and valuable intangible,
it is unlikely to be possible to identify a reliable comparable for it, and a one-sided method that
tests the return to that enterprise will not be appropriate" (emphasis added). We have some
difficulty agreeing with the very strong statement that simply because a party assumes
economically significant risks, a one-sided method will not be appropriate. Virtually every
independent company assumes certain economically significant risks, within the context of its
business model and industry. As a result, many economically significant risks are capable of
being benchmarked through external comparables, and a one-sided method is likely to be
appropriate.     Where independent comparables cannot be identified that are sufficiently
comparable, a one-sided method applied to that party is less likely to be appropriate, but may be
in some cases. We, therefore, recommend modifying the language to replace the phrase "will not
be" with "is less likely to be."
       G.     Specific Comments on Case Studies
We have discussed several general recommendations regarding the Case Studies above. We
would also like to offer the following specific drafting suggestions:

   •   In each Case Study, it would be appropriate to start by indicating the evidence the
       taxpayer relied on to establish the existing transfer prices. This evidence could then be
       evaluated in the Case Study. However, as currently written, none of the Case Studies
       encourages the tax administration to review the taxpayer's documentation or indicates
       that such a review has occurred.          In fact, the taxpayer's own transfer pricing
       documentation is only mentioned once, in Case Study 1, and only in passing. In none of
       the case studies are the taxpayer's transfer pricing method and comparables presented or
       analyzed.
       We would encourage further illustration and discussion of the ways in which the
       taxpayer's transfer pricing analysis can provide valuable assistance to tax administrations
       and help them conduct their transfer pricing analyses more efficiently and effectively.
       This recognition is presumably what has inspired the global proliferation of




                                               30
Platform for Collaboration on Tax
February 21, 2017
Page 15


       documentation requirements in recent years and the focus in the recent BEPS work on
       further improving the usefulness of documentation for risk assessments and examinations.
       The taxpayer has already had to carefully evaluate, analyze, and document its functions
       and assets and the risk profiles of the entities involved in order to be select what it
       believes to be the most appropriate transfer pricing method to test the arm's length nature
       of each transaction. For example, where the TNMM is applied, the benchmark search
       steps outlined in deriving the final set of comparable companies can provide a tax
       administrator with vital information relevant to its evaluation of the reasonableness of the
       taxpayer's comparable company benchmark set. The information already prepared by the
       taxpayer can thus provide a useful starting point and source of information. The
       taxpayer's documentation and responses to any additional information requests can assist
       in the quick and efficient identification of points for further discussion. While the ability
       to leverage the taxpayer's initial information and analysis can benefit any tax
       administration, it seems particularly valuable for tax administrations with relatively
       limited resources and experience. The Draft should encourage this more affirmatively.

       Of course, tax authorities should be expected to retain an appropriate degree of
       independent skepticism about taxpayer positions, and the Case Studies appropriately
       advocate independent review and fact development by the tax authorities, The Case
       Studies should also emphasize the importance and utility of reviewing taxpayer
       documentation where provided.

   •   The Case Studies focus on delineating the transactions and, ultimately, on
       recharacterizing the transactions. However, they do this without considering whether the
       taxpayer's transfer pricing method and com parables correctly capture the features of the
       transaction. For example, in Case Study 3, B Co. is remunerated through a 5.4%
       handling fee plus any gain or loss in the price of gold. The taxpayer's basis for selecting
       this transfer price is never presented. The Case Study merely remarks that B Co. is found
       to be earning "substantial profits" and appears to be performing routine functions, and
       therefore its profits should be tested via the TNMM. We believe it would be far more
       instructive if the Case Study first presented the market and benchmark data that the
       taxpayer used to establish the handling fee. It is possible that in the market, this
       magnitude of handling fee is fully consistent with arm's length dealings. Even if the
       transfer pricing can be challenged, presenting the taxpayer's approach and evidence
       would provide a basis to illustrate numerous other considerations raised in the body of the
       Draft.

   •   The Case Studies are relatively complex, but nonetheless miss opportunities to provide
       guidance and clarification on some important points. For example, the Case Studies do
       not recommend careful analysis of the financial performance of the companies or of the
       drivers of profit performance, even though they suggest that the observed level of profit
       can or should be a factor in selecting a tested party, a method and a transfer price. Case




                                                31

Page 16

       Study 1, for instance, states that A Co. has been in operation for 6 years, and that the tax
       audit covers 5 of these 6 years. The facts do not, however, address the possibility of A
       Co. having substantial upfront start-up costs, or other similar considerations that could
       affect its reported profitability. Case Study 2 has a similar gap. The Case Study
       introduces the statement that XYZ (M) earned significant losses over the life of the
       contract. However, the example does not address whether those losses are solely arising
       from the transfer price paid to XYZ (S), or whether the losses exist regardless of the
       transfer price. This matters because if there are losses beyond the transfer price, then an
       understanding of what drove those losses must be developed to assess the situation. That
       understanding should be added to the factors assessed in evaluating the appropriateness
       of the transfer pricing method and result. For example, if the losses arose because XYZ
       (M), in its capacity of providing local office and IT support, contracted for excessive real
       estate and IT facilities and resources well in excess of what was needed, then it may be
       appropriate for XYZ (M) to bear the financial consequences of these poor decisions.
       However, the solution offered by the Case Study is likely to result in shifting losses to
       XYZ(S) and the basis for and appropriateness of this result also needs to be discussed.

We would like to reiterate our appreciation for the opportunity to comment on the Draft of this
Toolkit. We believe that this is an important project that stands to provide benefits to all
stakeholders, and the Draft provides an excellent starting point for this. We hope that our
comments and recommendations are taken in the constructive spirit in which they are offered.
The TPWG would be pleased to discuss these points further if it would be helpful.

from Sol Picciotto.
We are very grateful for the opportunity to submit comments on the discussion draft "A
Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing
Analyses" prepared by The Platform for Collaboration on Tax.

SUMMARY

The existing international tax rules are interpreted to require taxation of multinational
enterprises ("MNEs") as if their various constituent entities are independent of each other and
dealing at "arm's length'. This independent entity concept generates a perverse incentive to
create complex and fragmented corporate structures, locating affiliates in convenient
jurisdictions to minimise tax. MNEs have increasingly taken advantage of this, and now
consist of often complex corporate structures with hundreds of such entities. In practice,
MNEs conduct centrally directed and managed operations that have been intentionally
apportioned amongst various legal entities not due to compelling operational reasons or legal
concerns, but rather primarily for tax-motivated planning purposes.
A typical tax efficient group structure will ensure that affiliates located in high-tax
jurisdictions are contractually responsible for performing "routine" activities and thus should
be remunerated by reference to "comparable" firms which have relatively low returns, with
the entrepreneurial return allocated to affiliates located in zero- and low-tax jurisdictions.
Comparability analyses are often used by MNEs to support the low returns earned by their
"routine" affiliates. The contractual allocation of risks, functions and assets which delineate
the local affiliate in a high-tax jurisdiction as a "routine" entity often gives rise to base
erosion and profit shifting.
The Discussion Draft (DD) Toolkit is based on the flawed assumptions that a local entity
often conducts only "routine" activities, has no unique and valuable contributions, and should
not be entitled to any portion of the entrepreneurial profit. It also accepts the fiction that the
various business units of a multinational enterprise should be considered to be independently



                                               33
managed, albeit with comm on ownership and some top-level management that limits itself to
overseeing policy and direction.
In contrast, most MNE s operate as centrally-managed unitary businesses performing core
functions and using intangible property in multiple countries. For most MNE s, the
characterisation of a member entity as one performing merely "routine" activities with no
unique and valuable contributions will therefore often be wrong. The business operations of
the associated enterprises are typ ically highly integrated, and the entities each make their own
contributions to the synergy of the group as a whole. We consider that the examples in the
Discussion Draft ( e.g. boxes 5 and 6) should be amended to reflect this and therefore reject
the use of routine activity comparable analyses as an appropriate approach to determine the
return earned by the local affiliate in such cases.
In our submission 1 to the latest ·oECD Working Party 6's Discussion Draft "Revised
Guidance on Profits Splits", we recommended a wider use of the profit-split method by
applying it to a number of common business models adopted by MNEs. Such application
would use concrete allocation keys and weightings for each common business model. Using
such concrete keys and weightings would provide a true simplification for both taxpayers and
tax authorities. This method also reflects our view that, for most MNEs, it is wrong to assume
that their member entities perform merely "routine" activities. Further, given the subjectivity
of transfer pricing analyses, which is only increased by the lack of comparables in many
countries, such concrete keys and weightings for common business models would go a long
way toward establishing transfer prices that are fair to the countries and taxpayers concerned.
The results should virtually always be within the wide pricing ranges found in traditional
transfer pricing analysis that tries to identify comparables for all the assets, functions, and
risks.2
The work on profit splits is not yet concluded. We hope that final OECD guidance will widen
the scope for the profit split method, thereby significantly reducing the need for traditional
transfer pricing comparability analyses. Finalisation of this Toolkit should be delayed until
agreement has been reached on a better approach to transfer pricing.
Hence, we oppose the widespread use of comparability analyses from both the. theoretical and
practical perspectives. We appreciate that the Discussion Draft points out the many flaws
associated with this approach that make it so subjective and create such wide transfer pricing
ranges.
         The Discussion Draft clearly outlines why both from a theoretical and practical
         perspective, comparability analyses are not a feasible and cost-effective approach
         for allocating profits (and thus taxes) between associated enterprises,
         particularly for developing countries. We strongly recommend that the
         Discussion Draft be amended to provide guidance for expanded use of the profit
         split method using concrete allocation keys and weightings for each common
         business model used by MNEs.

 To illustrate briefly how wide and subjective the transfer pricing analysis can be, and focusing just on a group
member treated as performing routine functions (i.e. ignoring any non-routine functions that we believe will
commonly exist in reality), a traditional analysis generally produces a wide range of profit margins. For
example, the comparables analysis will find a l % to 14% range of results, with an interquartile range between
3%-8% and a median of 6%. Probably none of the com parables identified will have perfect alignment with the
assets, functions, and risks of the group member being analysed. It is also a matter of judgement deciding which
potential comparables to include in the analysis. The whole process is simply very subjective.

The lack of comparable data available in a sign ificant number of countries, the subjectivity
and room for opportu nistic behavior of MN E taxpayers in the comparable search process, and
the lack of experience and resources faced by developing countries' tax administrations show
that this approach is inh erently flawed.

GENERAL REMARKS

The approach adopted
The Discussion Draft identifies a number of key challenges in conducting comparability
analyses by tax administrations, such as the lack of appropriate data, challenges and costs
associated in accessing databases, and the inability of tax administrations to effectively audit
the comparability analyses prepared by taxpayers.
These pose major challenges for tax authorities, in particular in developing countries. These
countries face special problems of lack of data, the low quality of such data available to
perform comparability analyses, and the use of comparability adjustments. The Discussion
Draft reports that for more than 164 countries in 2013 there was not sufficient comparable
data. In our view this is a key flaw in the use of this method as the basis to allocate profits to
an associated enterprise.
The problem is not just a lack of data, but because true comparables generally do not exist.
This is due to the real competitive advantages enjoyed by MNEs resulting from their
economies of scale and scope and the synergy resulting from their internationally integrated
operations.
The Discussion Draft also identifies a number of areas in which the comparability analysis
process allows for subjectivity and opportunistic behavior by taxpayers, thereby undermining
the validity of the approach. In each step of the comparability analysis, there are opportunities
for taxpayers to ensure that comparability analyses support BEPS structures.
Most tax optimization planning strategies start with the identification of the expected
remuneration for a "routine" entity, and intra-group pricing is then set to achieve that specific
return and to ensure that any additional "entrepreneurial" profit is allocated to zero- or low-
taxed entities within the group.
Comparability analyses are therefore prepared with a view to identify an arm's length range
that supports the preferred tax optimal return, rather than with the view to identify what an
arm's length return should be. In practice, the comparability analysis is one of trial and error,
and search criteria can be changed in order to find a suitable arm's length range. While
transfer pricing analyses may appear to be objective and scientific, they are anything but that.
It is often the case that the comparability analysis will be undertaken to support the results of
a local affiliate. The Discussion Draft fails to mention that, in most cases, tax authorities will
be presented with only the comparability analysis which supports the pricing used by the
local MNE's affiliate(s).
The Discussion Draft outlines a number of steps in the process, such as inclusion of
additional screening for functional comparability, adjustments for the cost of working capital,
and adjusting for country risk. All these allow taxpayers to influence the results of the
comparability analysis to ensure that the return earned by the local MNE's affiliate is within
the desired arm's length range of results.
Changes to search criteria and adjustments to comparable companies can result in very
different arm's length ranges. Unless tax authorities are in a position to replicate the
taxpayer's comparability analysis and fully understand the impact of the criteria used and

                                                3
                                                35
choices made by the taxpayer, it is very challenging for tax authorities to determine whether
this analysis has identified a reasonable range of arm's length results.
Furthermore, a significant number of countries do not have access to relevant databases,
while others do not have the skills and experience to effectively use the databases. They
therefore face an uphill struggle against the legions of accountants/lawy ers that prepare
transfer pricing documentation for MNE s.
       The Discussion Draft correctly identifies a number of critical flaws in the
       argument that using comparable searches is likely to result in the determination
       of an arm's length return in many countries. Such countries generally have little
       or no comparable data and their tax authorities have little ability to effectively
       audit transfer pricing analyses prepared by specialists for MNE taxpayers due to
       lack of experience, access to comparable databases, and lack of resources.
At the same time, some of the recommendations included in the Discussion Draft to address
the difficulties in accessing comparables, particularly those in relation to making optimal use
of the data, determination of and making comparability adjustments, and determining arm's
length remuneration, lack any clear evidence that such recommendations are likely to lead to
sustainable improvements.
Whilst we agree with the flaws identified in the report, it seems to us counter-productive to
try to address such significant problems by suggesting a number of potential changes to the
comparable search process where there is no clear evidence that such changes are likely to
lead to a more accurate representation of what local affiliates' remuneration should be. It is a
waste of scarce resources to try to build capacity for poor countries to try to administer a
system which is fundamentally flawed, as shown by the experience of developed countries.
Just recall that even the U.S. tax authorities were reported to have spent $2 million hiring
outside experts to help them pursue one transfer pricing case.
       We consider that the Discussion Draft should refrain from suggesting ways to
       improve the comparability analyses' process, since there is no clear evidence to
       support such suggestions, and put more emphasis on the potential alternatives
       available, outlined in Part III of the Discussion Draft, as well as others.

Proposed solutions
The Discussion Draft outlines a number of actions that could be taken to address situations
where there is a lack of data.
We consider that only some of the actions identified in the Discussion Draft address the
immediate need of tax authorities, and particularly those of developing countries, to have a
system in place that is workable, cost effective, and that leads to an appropriate determination
of an affiliate's tax base.
We suggest that a more fruitful way forward would be the use of safe harbour prices or
margins, particularly if these are based on information available to tax authorities through
taxpayer-lodged information. The experience of countries which have created safe harbours is
positive, as it provides certainty of revenue and simplifies and reduces compliance and
auditing costs. Having said this, though, we believe that the Discussion Draft should
emphasise that safe harbours that assume only routine activities should not apply to MNE
situations where each member uses group IP and contributes to the profitability of the group.
In such cases, safe harbours encourage BEPS planning. Rather, the profit split approach as
earlier described herein will provide a more appropriate transfer pricing result.

                                              36
Brazil's prescriptive rules in this area (described in Box 22 of the DD) are a useful example
of a system that works. It fixes the gross profit margins for a number of typ es of transactions
and ensures that interest and royalty payments to overseas tax residents are subject to high
withholding taxes. This has effectively reduced BEPS opportunities for MNE s in Brazil.
Most importantly for many developing countries, Brazil's approach provides a system which
is predictable and easy to administer, and creates few conflicts.
A refinement of Brazil's approach would be to develop an industry specific Advanced
Pricing Agreements ("APA") program. Such an approach has been successful in relation to
the package holiday industry in the Dominican Republic. This program set out a general
framework for companies in the all-inclusive hotel sector, on the basis of which to establish
individual AP As including the selection of the transfer pricing method and based on different
rates depending on the category and geographic location of the taxpayer. 3
An alternative approach to safe harbours, which also dispenses with the need to search for
comparables, has recently been suggested by Michael Durst.4 Under this approach, local
affiliates would be required to earn profit margins equal to 25 per cent of the global group's
consolidated margin (based on earnings before tax). Such a benchmarking approach would
provide a simple and clear method to ensure that the local affiliates earn an appropriate
remuneration which reflects their contribution to the total income generated by the MNE. We
suggest that this alternative approach should be included in the discussion draft.
In view of the fundamental flaws of comparability analyses, we strongly doubt the
recommendation for more capacity building in this area. Investing government or donor
funding toward this end, including the purchase of access to commercial databases, will not
produce a sustainable improvement. Of course, any increase in the resources of tax
authorities will quickly produce some additional revenues, as tax advisers rein in some of
their more aggressive practices. However, it is also likely to create conflicts due to the
inherently subjective nature of the decisions involved in comparability analysis. It would be
far more cost-effective to reform the rules and establish simple methods that produce fair
results which are easy to administer, than to invest substantial resources to boost highly
specialist skills to operate a defective system.
There are better and more practical ways to determine the appropriate return earned by a local
affiliate which do not need to rely on a flawed search for comparables. There is no evidence
that investing in this area would be a good use of developing countries' resources or donor
funds and as such this recommendation should be removed.
         An increased use of the profit-split method and safe harbours/fixed margins
         would significantly obviate the need to rely on a method which is proven to be
         highly subjective, difficult to implement and which facilitates opportunistic
         behaviours by taxpayers.

 SPECIFIC COMMENTS

  Pages 6-7: "While 'perf  ect' or ideal comparables may only rarely be available, commonly the
. data that is available will still allow a reasonably reliable analysis to be performed and a
  satisfactory approximation of an arm's length outcome to be determined. " This statement
  seems incompatible with the evidence provided on page 23, which states that for 164
  countries, fewer than 1,000 local observations were available in 2013. A "satisfactory
  approximation" in such cases of limited data will often result in a very broad range of
  potential prices based on highly limited comparability.
 Page 7 "where comparables local to the tested party are scarce or unavailable, data from
 other geographic markets (potential 'foreign comparables ') can be considered. In such
                                                   erences in markets are likely to make a
 cases, it will be important to examine whether diff
 material difference to the condition being examined. Where the transaction occurs in a truly
 global market, geography may not make a material difference [.}"
 The Discussion Draft provides good and simple examples and explanations, but it tends to
 make light of the necessary sophistication, extensive work, and time and resources required
 in practice to make and/or evaluate functional and comparability analyses.
 A more realistic comment on this issue is provided on page 43: "In sum, the use off   oreign
 data-though f   airly extensive in practice given the lack of local comparables=-has not been
 studied sufficiently to draw definitive conclusions about its reliability. "
 The available evidence is at best inconclusive and the report should refrain from
 recommending solutions to key problems where there is no sufficient evidence of their
 appropriateness. Indeed, a close examination of the available studies, some of which are
 cited, suggests that using foreign data is unsuitable, not least due to the complex techniques
 needed to perform adjustments, and the wide ranges of the resulting so-called comparables.
 Pages 51-52: " ... all parties need to be realistic about the use of comparability data and
 avoid the misperception that comparability analyses always result in a well-defined and
 definitive answer. It is often necessary to recognise that a comparability analysis provides
 only an approximate answer and that some flexibility is needed to determine a principled
 answer in many cases. Some countries, particularly those that are more experienced in
 transfer pricing seek to mitigate this issue by negotiating with taxpayers to arrive at a
 sensible, arm 's length result, however others, particularly many developing countries, prefer
 to avoid settlement of cases in this manner. Further, many developing countries report that
 they do not have the capacity to negotiate in this way. However, where tax administrations do
 negotiate with taxpayers, the available data will inf orm the negotiations. [Footnote
 omitted.] "
 This emphasizes the subjectivity of the decisions involved, and the resulting need for
 negotiations that might be little more than horse-trading over many millions/billions of tax
 dollars. Again, the Discussion Draft seems to fail to recognise and address the fact that there
 is no level playing field between tax authorities in many countries, and in particular
 developing countries, and the legions of paid accountants/lawyers that prepare transfer
 pricing documentation for MNEs.

In our submission5 to the latest OECD Working Party 6's Discussion Draft "Revised
Guidance on Profits Splits" we have recommended a wider use of the profit-split method to
cover a number of common business models adopted by MNE, with concrete allocation keys
and weightings for these common business models, which could provide a true simplification
for both taxpayers and tax authorities.
The work in this area is not concluded and we hope that, ultimately, this will result in a
widening of the scope for the profit split method to apply, which will significantly restrict the
need for comparability analyses.
Part III, Section 8 concerns "Anti-avoidance and other tax base protection measures". There
is one important tax base protection measure that we consider should be added to this section.
That is the finding of a permanent establishment (PE) or dependent agent PE (DAPE) that is
directly taxable in the host country.
A PE or DAPE may be found in two business circumstances:
       •   The first and most common, which was also a principal focus of BEPS Action 6, is
           the finding of a PE or DAPE when a foreign seller or service provider is earning
           income from selling products or services to customers within a country through
           commissionaire or other arrangements that avoid the criteria required for a PE.
       •   The second, and seemingly ignored circumstance, involves a group that conducts a
           domestically-run business that has structured inter-company contracts with zero- and
           low-taxed foreign group members causing those foreign group members to earn
           significant profits from that business.
Given the significant difficulties, resource requirements, and subjectivity of a transfer pricing
audit, where the circumstances support it, factually finding a PE or DAPE and taxing the
foreign taxpayer on the profits attributable to the PE or DAPE may be significantly easier
than a full transfer pricing investigation in some cases.
The first business circumstance is one that is currently being explored as part of the further
post-BEPS work that is being done in connection with Article 7 and the attribution of profits
to a PE or DAPE.
We will only make one practical point here. In a situation in which a foreign company, say
from Country A, sells products or provides services to customers in Country B and has a
DAPE through a related-party commissionaire or agent in Country B, there is normally little
or no practical need for the Country B tax authorities to conduct a transfer pricing
investigation to determine the relative shares of profits between the foreign company and the
commissionaire or agent. Where income is being taxed by Country B either in the hands of
the domestic commissionaire or agent or in the hands of the foreign company, it will often
make little difference to the overall tax collected by Country B.
We suggest that Part III, Section 8, includes this point that taxation of both the DAPE and the
local commissionaire or agent may in some cases be an alternative mechanism that avoids a
full transfer pricing investigation.
Regarding the second business circumstance, the inclusion in this discussion draft of Case
Study 1 shows the importance of this second circumstance. Many multinational companies
manage and operate major portions of their business within one country, say Country A.
However, using common profit-shifting structures, such multinationals often create
entrepreneur companies located in some low- or zero-tax Country B, that record significant

                                                         7
                                                        39
profits. These entrepreneur companies often have few employees and conduct few direct
business activities, relying instead on related party service agreements under which related
parties in Country A perform the crucial business functions that really earn the entrepreneur
companies their profits.
In such cases, the facts that Country A's tax authority learn will often support the existence of
a PE or DAPE of the entrepreneur in Country A. Where this is the case, there is no need for
any transfer pricing investigation to determine the proper level of profits within the Country
B entrepreneur and the Country A related party service providers. Rather, the Country A tax
authority can accept the transfer pricing used and simply tax the PE or DAPE of the
entrepreneur. The aggressiveness of many profit-shifting structures will mean that most or all
of the income earned within the entrepreneur results from a business that is conducted within
Country A and is appropriately taxed by Country A.
We consider that brief mention of this could be included in Part IV, Section 3, Paragraph 9 of
the Discussion Draft.
Page 71, Case Study 1: Case Study 1 should be supplemented to make clear that there are
two practical approaches available under this case study that the tax authority of Country A
could pursue. One, of course, is the delineation of the transaction in the manner provided in
the case study for applying Country A's transfer pricing rules.
A second approach that will likely be available under the specific, but not uncommon, facts
of Case Study 1 is that Country A's tax authority could accept the transfer pricing used by A
Co and B Co and recognize that A Co's services create a DAPE in Country A for B Co. (See
OECD Model Tax Convention Article 5 as modified by the BEPS Final Report dated 5
October 2015 for Action 6). As such, the Country A tax authority could impose direct tax on
B Co. Depending on Country A's tax laws, most or all of B Co's profits would be taxable in
Country A.
A particularly important practical point is that the work to delineate the actual transaction is,
for the most part, all that will be necessary to establish B Co's tax obligation to Country A.
There is no need to go through the further time consuming and subjective steps in a transfer
pricing audit to conduct a search for comparables and the difficult analyses that accompany
this process. Thus, from a practical perspective, application of direct taxation on B Co will
result in a much lower expenditure of time and effort by the Country A tax authorities and for
the taxpayer as well.
Another practical point is that if A Co were the U.S., for example, it is likely that 100¾ of B
Co's profits would be taxable in the U.S. Further, with the branchprofits tax within the U.S.
tax law, there would be an additional up to 30% tax on the branch profits tax base, which is B
Co's taxable income less the normal 35% corporate tax payable to the U.S. on the taxable
income of the dependent agent PE. That gives an effective tax rate ofup to 54.5% of taxable
profit (35% + 30% x (100% - 35%)). Some number of other countries would have similar tax
rules that apply to the DAPEs of foreign corporations, including the branch profits tax.
The difference should be noted in the case study discussion that where the Country A tax
authority applies the first approach (i.e. applying transfer pricing rules), then the taxpayer
paying the additional tax is A Co, a domestic taxpayer within Country A. In this case, no
branch profits tax will apply.
On the other hand, where the Country A's tax authority decides to apply the second approach
(i.e. the DAPE), then the taxpayer is B Co. Where Country A's tax law includes a branch
profits tax, then that tax will apply in addition to the normal Country A's corporate tax.

 DATA FOR TRANSFER PRICING ANALYSES


 Dear Members of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax,

 Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Discussion Draft: A Toolkit for Addressing
 Difficulties in Accessing Com parables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses (the "Discussion Draft") issued
 on 24 January 2017. We acknowledge and thank the Platform for Collaboration on Tax (the "Platform")
 for the time and effort put into this comprehensive draft.

 BIAC strongly supports the Platform in its role of coordinating of efforts between international
 organisations on tax matters, and greatly welcomes the work done by the Platform to create a toolkit
 (the "Toolkit") that will address the difficulties in accessing and effectively utilising comparables data.
 Specifically, BIAC recognises the usefulness of the initiative in seeking to address transfer pricing
 disputes and controversies. We believe this will be of benefit to both tax authorities and taxpayers in
 developing countries, and can therefore act as a catalyst for investment, jobs, growth and
 development.

  The Toolkit represents a very thorough review of Transfer Pricing issues, summarising general
· questions and common practices, which should be used as a valuable reference tool in tandem with
  OECD guidelines and other supranational/ local regulations. However, BIAC believes that it is of great
  utmost importance, given these multiple resources, that the Toolkit recommends a priority rule to
  ensure the greatest possible clarity for tax authorities and taxpayers in the event of any differences.
  We have included further discussion on this point, in addition to other more specific comments, below
  for your consideration.

 Again, we thank you for the opportunity to comment on this Discussion Draft, and look forward to
 working with you further on this project.

 Sincerely,
 Will Morris, Chair

                   BIAC                                      BUS NESS AT THE OECD




General Comments


        1.      BIAC strongly believes that the effectiveness and value of the Toolkit is entirely linked to the
                ability for taxpayers and tax authorities to interpret the Toolkit in conjunction with the OECD
                Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations ("TPG"),
                the United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries ("UNM"),
                and local regulations. Therefore, we would recommend the addition of clear guidance at the
                beginning of the Toolkit which would allow taxpayers and tax authorities to understand
                which guidance should be relied on in the event of a discrepancy between the Toolkit and
                those documents. While the Toolkit provides valuable guidance in addressing transfer
                pricing questions, BIAC believes that deference should be given to the TPG and UNM in such
                instances, considering the wide support these documents have worldwide and the general
                acceptance and validity given by Tax Administrations and taxpayers to them as a reference
                for completing transfer pricing analyses.


        2.      BIAC continues to support the application of the arm's length principle ("ALP"). We believe it
                would be appropriate to include some brief upfront comments on how to apply
                functional/asset/risk analyses (in line with the TPG and UNM) to ensure the main body of
                the text on com parables is read with this perspective. Without this guidance, a country may
                feel it is appropriate to seek recharacterisation where comparables are not immediately
                visible.


        3.      BIAC observes that a comparison between controlled and uncontrolled transactions is a
                critical element of the ALP and as such, it is necessary to establish clear, comprehensive
                independence criteria as search processes seek to eliminate transactions that have been
                entered into by entities that belong to a multinational group. However, BIAC believes that
                less rigid independence criteria when conducting benchmarking analysis could be a
                simplified option as long as it is applied uniformly. This simplified approach may also assist
                with improving the number of potential comparables (and thus may be of particular use
                where there are scarce com parables for a given transaction). In addition, in order to ensure
                that appropriate com parables are not overlooked or excluded, we would recommend
                broadening the independence criteria in Appendix 7 beyond the Bureau van Dijk indicators
                alone. On the sensitive issue of independence, it would seem appropriate to ensure that the
                indicators come from a range of sources.


       4.       A concern remains over the possibility of tax administrations making use of data collected to
                obtain com parables or to populate internal databases that are not generally available and/or
                not easily verified from publicly available data (often known as "secret comparables"). BIAC
                notes that certain countries specifically prohibit the use of secret com parables or generally
                refrain from using them in practice. However, this prohibition is not comprehensive. Secret
                comparables can penalise small local companies that will struggle to find acceptable
                com parables, and damage countries' capabilities to attract foreign business as a result of the
                uncertainty they create.


       5.       Appreciating that it may be difficult to completely eliminate the use of secret com parables,
                BIAC strongly recommends that full transparency into the use of such information is


                                                                                                                                                                2

                   encouraged. At the very least, a detailed description of the analysis behind such
                   comparables should be made publicly available. For example, this could include creating
                   ranges of industry average Profit Level Indicators, or mark ups for common services, in a
                   useful, searchable, anonymous and publishable format. Additionally, it is essential that
                   taxpayers and tax authorities have access to the same tools and information available to
                   allow each party to adequately defend their respective positions in a balanced way, and
                   (even more importantly) this could avoid disputes arising in the first place. Given the scarcity
                   of resources in some Tax Administrations, the adoption of measures for avoiding future
                   litigation should be a common goal.


        6.         The Toolkit recommends the use of the Profit Split Method ("PSM") as an alternative where
                   there is a lack of com parables. Although there is recognition that the selection of a profit
                   split method based purely on the lack of data risks leading to a significant departure from
                   the ALP, BIAC is concerned that this recommendation in the Toolkit will still result in tax
                   authorities quickly defaulting to a PSM in scenarios where it may be inappropriate.
                   Additionally, the application of the residual profit split method still requires comparables
                   data in order to allocate the routine return as the first step. Similarly, the application of the
                   PSM using a contribution analysis is often dependent on comparable data. As such, BIAC
                   would welcome further qualifications within the Toolkit recommendations to ensure that
                   the use of the profit split method is limited to cases where more appropriate methods are
                   not available and that further guidance on appropriate allocation keys is provided so that it
                   is not used as a tool to apportion profits arbitrarily.


        7.         BIAC welcomes the case studies included in the Toolkit and believes these examples will
                   provide taxpayers and tax authorities with valuable guidance. However, BIAC notes that
                   each case study results in a recharacterisation of the respective transactions, which is not
                   representative of the very small number of actual transactions that will require
                   recharacterisation. BIAC recommends that a statement to this effect be added, as well as
                   additional case studies be included to demonstrate examples where transfer pricing
                   adjustments are made but the transactions remain respected. Ideally, these would be more
                   prominent than the examples that result in recharacterisation, to re-enforce the OECD
                   position that recharacterisation is only appropriate in exceptional circumstances.


       8.          BIAC strongly supports the efforts of the Platform to encourage the use of safe harbours. In
                   particular, BIAC agrees that the establishment of bilateral safe harbours significantly reduces
                   the risk (and limits the quantum) of double taxation and we believe that such safe harbours
                   are therefore a very useful tool in achieving tax certainty for taxpayers and tax authorities.
                   BIAC stresses, however, that such safe harbours must be consistent with the facts and
                   circumstances of all cross-border transactions within groups, and should therefore be
                   elective and based on the ALP. The risk of double taxation will arise where safe harbours are
                   not based on ALP.


       9.          BIAC believes that the use of "comparability adjustments" is a valuable tool, especially in
                   scenarios where there may be a lack of quality data, and agrees with the Platform's
                   assertion that such adjustments should only be used after careful consideration of the
                   applicable facts and circumstances. Cooperation _b etween taxpayers and tax authorities will
               be paramount to using comparability adjustments to increase the reliability of results given
               the high degree of subjectivity that can be involved. Additionally, technical difficulties may

                 arise in the application of such adjustments due to the complexity and required industry
                 specificity of the calculations. To that end, BIAC recommends a program of training for tax
                 authorities as part of capacity building initiatives to ensure effective and consistent
                 application in line with the ALP and economic reality.


        10. BIAC encourages the Platform to further analyse the use of "foreign com parables" so that
                 definitive conclusions may be drawn as to their reliability. Faced with a lack of local
                 com parables, the use of foreign com parables, while not without its challenges, may provide
                 the best solution. This is especially true in the context of margin-based methods. BIAC
                 observes, however, that sufficient studies have not been undertaken as of yet to gauge the
                 degree of reliability and agrees with the Platform that this is an issue that would benefit
                 from further study.


        11. BIAC supports the use of anti-avoidance measures where they are implemented in a way
                that is appropriately targeted and do not result in undue compliance burdens. BIAC
                 encourages the Platform to provide additional guidance in this area because such measures
                 should only be applied to high-risk issues and not used as a means for arbitrary collection.
                 However, we do not consider that anti avoidance is an appropriate topic for a toolkit
                 discussing transfer pricing com parables (which appears to be recognised in the Toolkit itself;
                 "the topic of anti-avoidance measures is extremely broad, and thus beyond the scope of this
                 toolkit"). Accordingly, we believe that section 3.7 should be removed, and addressed more
                 comprehensively in a separate toolkit. In particular, the suggestion that royalties should be
                 capped as a percentage of EBITDA seems misplaced in a discussion of transfer pricing
                 com parables, and is out of line with the international consensus (intangibles are
                fundamentally different to monetary capital, which itself was the scope of a significant
                amount of discussion and work in relation to BEPS Action 4 before that recommendation
                was finalised).

Sub: Request for comments on a draft toolkit from the Platform for Collaboration on Tax


Please see the following comments from side BMZ/GIZ (Germany) to the proposed draft toolkit on
Transfer Pricing:

    •   In our impression, the toolkit contains many practical elements that can be of use to
        practitioners (e.g. commonly used profit level indicators for particular types of businesses,
        step-by-step templates for screening purposes, a number of country practices, sample
        legislation or regulations). It is also useful that the toolkit provides educational content,
        such as case studies, overview of methods etc.

    •   We also welcome that the appendix includes practical documents such as a questionnaire
        for functional analysis or ratios that can be used to analyse enterprises. Even though these
        appendices are not new but derived from existing sources, it is nevertheless useful to have
        these sources gathered in one document. However, the order of the appendices could be
        better structured in a more systematic way. Some of the individual appendices could be
        merged, e.g. Appendix 16 ("Financial ratios and acronyms", Appendix 17 ("Common
        acronyms") and Appendix 18 ("Ratios measuring functions, assets and risks'.').

   •    It appears that a reference to business restructurings and international pricing methods
        besides database analyses is missing ("hypothetical arm's length method").

   •    An issue is whether developing countries can cope with the costs of commercial databases
        that can be used to access comparables data. These databases are often quite costly. We
        propose that Appendix 3, which contains examples of commercial databases, should also
        provide information on their costs. However, in this regard we welcome that the toolkit also
        places some emphasis on approaches to implementing transfer pricing rules that reduce
        the reliance on such databases.

   •    The issue of relying on data to determine the arm's length price of a transaction in
        developing economies cannot be underestimated (lack of (IT-) infrastructure, human
        capacity, substantial informal sector, missing publication requirements for financial
        statements, lack of comparable businesses). Even in developed economies, the correct
        determination of transfer prices is a science. Risk of non-compliance might rise due to the
        complexity of filing a return with transfer prices determined according to complicated data
        analyses and comparison and using costly commercial databases.

Marion Fleuth-Leferink

The Platform for Collaboration on Tax, A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data
for Transfer Pricing Analyses (Discussion Draft issued January 2017)

Comments by Pat Breslin and Linda Fernandez

Dear members of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax:

Breslin Consulting would like to thank the Platform for Collaboration on Tax ("PCT") and its
participating organizations-including the IMF, OECD, UN, and World Bank Group-for their joint
leadership in developing the draft Toolkit, 1 and for the opportunity to comment on this very important
project.

Below, we offer feedback and observations on this important topic based on decades of experience in
transfer pricing and comparable data analysis across many country jurisdictions. These experiences have
enabled us to face many challenges cited by the PCT with respect to comparable data and analysis more
generally. Indeed, many such challenges were once encountered in some form within what are now
more experienced country jurisdictions. Other such challenges persist within countries that are among
the earliest adopters of transfer pricing regulations and procedures. Further, we recognize that additional
challenges are more common today in countries that have more recently adopted transfer pricing rules
and enforcement procedures, or that seek to further develop such processes. Tn all cases, we hope to lend

 tax base erosion and profit shifting ("BEPS"), by contributing written and oral public commentary on
 multiple occasions at the OECD. The BEPS project culminated in revised OECD. transfer pricing
 guidelines to which the Toolkit makes references.2

 We applaud the draft and the very concise and coherent direction the Toolkit has taken thus far. Indeed,
 in many transfer pricing contexts it is a challenge to communicate the many complex issues undertaken
 by this draft in a brief manner. Often, the need for clarity and nuanced distinctions among the subject's
 key concepts requires and justifies lengthier explication.

 In this regard, the draft succeeds in covering an ambitious array of complex subject matter in a relatively
 brief yet comprehensive manner. Its reliance upon and references to more comprehensive guidance and
 documents-for example, the transfer pricing guidelines and manual produced by the OECD and the
 UN, respectively-is appropriate, and enables the Toolkit to effectively serve as a more concise
 reference document while leveraging these complementary efforts.

 Comments on Part I

 General comments

 The Introduction to the Toolkit sets out a clear and direct explanation of transfer pricing and explains
 different approaches tax administrations may use to determine whether the transfer prices they examine
 are appropriate. The Toolkit properly recognizes that "transfer pricing" is necessary and legitimate
 practice for multinational companies, while it proposes useful and practical ways to measure transfer
 prices by: a) the use of comparable data (which are never perfect, but often reliable), and b) prescriptive
 methods that do not rely on comparables.

 The following comments focus on the second paragraph of page 5, which properly notes that transfer
 prices per se are not necessarily problematic as they are inherent to the normal operations of any related
 group of companies to the extent such companies must transact with each other. Thus, transfer prices are
 an unavoidable fact of most related groups and they cannot alone be considered improper as is
 sometimes suggested in public statements that criticize "transfer pricing" itself as inappropriate.

 However, when transfer prices have the effect, whether intentional or not, of distorting the allocation of
 profits among the group companies in different jurisdictions, this may be problematic. The above-
 mentioned paragraph in the Toolkit concisely captures important consequences when transfer pricing
 "artificially shifts profits" and thus undermines the efficacy and fairness of tax systems on a domestic,
 international and increasingly global level.

 However, the authors would caution, or at least query, a portion of the second sentence of this

   For example, the Toolkit has a number ofreferences to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2016) which
 incorporates amendments set out in the 2015 BEPS Final Reports on Actions 8-10, Aligning Transfer Pricing
 Outcomes with Value Creation. For further information on contributions that professionals of Breslin Consulting

  paragraph: that is, in reference to whether "transfer prices used do not accord with internationally
  applicable norms or with the arm's length principle (emphasis added)." This use of"or" here raises
  questions about what other "internationally applicable norms" are meant as part of this statement, and
  whether or not such norms would produce outcomes that are consistent with the arm's length principle,
  as discussed further below.

  The concerns here remain relevant even if a reader might infer from the draft discussion of potential
  "internationally applicable norms" through its later discussion of prescriptive approaches, safe harbours,
  and the like.

  From an economics perspective, the arm's length principle has a conceptual and practical benefit over
  prescriptive approaches in that, if properly applied, it achieves internal consistency from the
  vantagepoint of both parties to a transaction-notwithstanding the common use of"one sided" methods.
  However, in practice, application of the arm's length principle is often subject to different and
  inconsistent interpretation, resulting in different transfer pricing outcomes from the perspectives of two
  or more MNC affiliates and the taxing authorities within relevant jurisdictions.

 It may be relevant to consider whether or not the co-existence of the arm's length standard in some
 jurisdictions with other "applicable international norms" in other jurisdictions invites or exacerbates
 further inconsistencies in outcomes---over and above those experienced when both relevant jurisdictions
 follow the arm's length principle.

  Specific comments

  In the fourth paragraph of page 5, second sentence, it may be better to describe most country transfer
  pricing rules as seeking "prices that are consistent with prices that would be seen between
  independent enterprises in comparable transactions and circumstances" rather than "the same prices
  (and other conditions) ... in comparable circumstances (emphasis added)."

  This revision could avoid potential confusion-which the draft effectively avoids elsewhere with
  respect to this same issue. For example, the draft properly recognizes that arm's length results are
  unlikely to arrive at "the same price" as any actual price(s) observed between independent parties. In
  this regard, the first paragraph on page 6 states, "It is important to emphasise that comparability
  analyses are not always primarily focused on the actual price of the transaction."

  Further, as this same paragraph properly notes, "It is important to also stress that comparability
  analyses are not always based directly on prices found in the market. More often, a comparability
  analysis utilises data on profit margins."

 However, even when a comparability analysis is focused on prices or transactions found in the
 market, rather than profit margins, there are further practical and conceptual reasons for pursuing the
 goal of consistency between related-party and comparable results, rather than the same results.

 For example, as well-addressed in Part II, Section 5, applications of the arm's length principle will
 often observe important differences between the best available comparable data-whether
 transactional or from financial statements-and the subject related party transaction and data. To the
 extent these differences would have a: material effect on prices or profits, it may be necessary to

make adjustments to improve the reliability of the comparables analysis in order to reach an arm's
length result. The aforementioned section of the draft provides useful discussion on "Determ ination
of and making comparability adjustments where appropriate," including with respect to pitfalls and
misuses of such adjustments.

Furthermore, the often imperfect nature of benchmark or comparable data explains the common use
of ranges and statistical analysis to determine acceptable prices or results between related
enterprises. For example, often an arm 's length result must be consistent with, or fall within, a range
of results for independent transactions or companies.

Finally, it worth recognizing that when independent parties negotiate under competitive market
conditions, each party is likely to weigh its different options, including the prices, other costs and
benefits, and expected returns associated with these options. In this sense, each independent party
would naturally consider a potential range of acceptable arm's length prices and anticipated
outcomes. At arm 's length, a deal may be struck within a "range of agreement" where overlap exists
between each party's separate range of acceptable prices. Thus, in positing these arm's length
conditions, the arm 's length principle is not necessarily a quest for any single (or same or identical)
actual price or observation.

This concept is reflected at least in part in paragraph 1.1.8 of the UN Practical Manual on Transfer
Pricing, which states,

        Rationally, an entity (acting independently and] having a view to its own interests ... would only
        acquire products or services ... if the purchase price was equal to, or cheaper than, prices being
        charged by unrelated suppliers. This principle applies, conversely, in relation to an entity
        providing a product or service; it would rationally only sell products or services to an associated
        entity if the sale price was equal to, or higher than, prices paid by unrelated purchasers. Prices
        should on this basis gravitate towards the so-called "arm's length price", the transaction price to
        which two unrelated parties would agree.

Additionally, Part I of the draft properly recognizes that,

        While some of the illustrations included in this toolkit conclude that the local associated
        enterprise conducts 'routine' activities and thus should be remunerated by reference to
        comparables which have relatively low (and stable) returns, this is far from a presumption
        and each case must be analysed on its own facts.

In effect, there is a potential correspondence between the term "presumption" as used here with respect to
"routine ... and relatively low (and stable) returns" and the term "prescriptive." The latter term is properly
used to describe approaches the Toolkit recognizes as alternatives when sufficient comparable data are
unavailable. But in practice, all too often the term "prescriptive" could also be applied to incomplete
comparability analyses that produce an overly routine approach and conclusion-and thus fail to realize
arm's length results. This critique may apply to transfer pricing analyses that, in practice, employ a
"prescriptive" approach that is overly reliant on a rote interpretation "accepted" transfer pricing methods
without sufficient analysis-making a routine out of applying routine markups.



                                                                                                Page 4 of9




                                                      52
Such generic approaches fail to utilize the full potential of the arm's length principle, and often yield
inconsistent interpretations and outcomes that would not be agreeable between independent parties
operating at arm's length.

In this manner, both tax practitioners and taxing authorities can sometimes reduce well-intentioned
guidance on the application of the arm 's length principle to a prescriptive approach. The Toolkit,
however, has the potential to reinforce a proper application of the arm 's length principle along with its
valuable predecessor guidelines noted earlier. For example, Part I concludes by noting,

        Indeed, the Toolkit emphasizes the importance of determining the most appropriate method
        according to the facts of the relevant transaction, with the result that the local associated
        enterprise may or may not be determined to be due all or part of the entrepreneurial profit or loss.
        As an example, see Case Study I which concludes that the local enterprise in fact assumes all the
        economically significant risks associated with the transactions. In this case, comparables need to
        be sought to benchmark an arm 's length return for the foreign enterprise, with the local entity
        being entitled to the remaining profits.

 Comments on Part II

 Part II of the Toolkit provides very helpful and cogent guidance in a concise manner. A common
 challenge in articulating a proper use of the arm's length principle is the tendency for any textual
 description of the process to appear more linear or formulaic than the analysis itself would be in practice.
 On the other hand, certain critical steps must be performed before others in order to properly apply the
 arm's length principle--so a degree of order must be maintained.

Despite these challenges, in many respects the draft succeeds in properly conveying the frequent need for
a multi-dimensional analytical approach while emphasizing the need for a logical ordering of steps where
necessary. Nevertheless, some suggestions are offered below to help avoid a mistakenly rote
interpretation of the Toolkit and the potential for inconsistent interpretation of its text.

For example, the second paragraph on page 9 properly captures critical initial steps in applying the arm's
length principle in stating,

    In order to apply the arm's length principle to controlled transactions it is necessary to thoroughly
    understand the commercial or financial relations between the associated enterprises and, specifically,
    the features of the controlled transaction(s) to be compared. The process of doing this is referred to
    below as "accurately delineating" the controlled transaction.

The paragraph continues,

   Once [the accurate delineation of the controlled transaction] is understood, it is necessary to select the
   most appropriate transfer pricing method and identify one or more potential uncontrolled transactions
   that may be considered comparable.

Items in the first quote above are essential starting points in an arm's length analysis, along with a
broad understanding of the overall business, facts and circumstances of the related group and the
parties to the transaction. These and other key steps are more fully described later in the side-by-side

                                                                                                Page 5 of9

  comparison of a "typical process for performing a comparability analysis"-which itself is also a
  very helpful reference.

  However, the second quote above could potentially be interpreted to suggest a more linear step-wise
  approach than would be advisable or even feasible. These steps-i.e. I) selecting the most
  appropriate transfer pricing method and 2) identifying potential comparables-may need to proceed
  in a non-linear, iterative or parallel fashion.

  Indeed, it usually will not be possible to select the most appropriate transfer pricing method without
  first considering "one or more potential uncontrolled transactions" that may be available, and then
  assessing whether or not these potential comparables meet with comparability criteria discussed
  elsewhere in the draft. It is also possible that available comparable data would include data types that
  are suitable to more than one method-and such available data should be given full consideration
  before selecting any one method. In short, one must ascertain the best available comparable data in
  conjunction with selecting an appropriate transfer pricing method.

  Additionally, the first sentence of this same paragraph may also be interpreted to suggest an
  unintended sequential ordering of steps. It could also be subject to other misinterpretation, as it
  states,

      The conditions of a controlled transaction are established, or tested, by reference to the conditions
      observed in comparable uncontrolled transactions.

  First, it is not entirely clear what "conditions" are being referred to in the phrase "conditions of a
  controlled transaction." Possible interpretations include:

      I)   A broader reference to conditions surrounding the "accurate delineation" of the related party
           transaction-as described in the text's very next sentence-including reference to the facts
           and circumstances of the associated enterprises, a~d their functions, assets and risks, as well
           as other "conditions" faced by the transacting parties more generally, such as "market
           conditions;" or

      2) A narrower reference to the "terms and conditions" of the controlled transaction to include
         its pricing terms, payment terms and structure, and other rights and obligations embodied as
         "conditions" of the contract itself. (Note that the accurate delineation of the controlled
         transaction-i.e. item I above-must also take this narrower reference to contractual
         conditions into account.)

  If the broader interpretation of "conditions" in item I were intended, then such conditions would
  pertain to the facts and circumstances of the related parties and their transaction. In that case, these
  conditions would exist a priori and must be understood as a starting point for the analysis. Here, a
  potential for inconsistent interpretation arises in that it does not seem that "the conditions of a
  controlled transaction" could necessarily be "established, or tested, by reference to the conditions
  observed in comparable uncontrolled transactions" as described in the full sentence. At least, this could
  imply that transactions comparable to the related party transaction could be identified and observed before
  accurately delineating the subject related party transaction itself.

An article addressing such issues is attached along with this submission. Entitled "Altera and the Arm's
Length Standard: The Case for Considering Stock Options," this analysis of a case in U.S. Tax Court was
recently published by one of the authors in Bloomberg BNA, Tax Management Transfer Pricing Report.
The article illustrates some of the consequences that arise when an analysis relies upon "reference to the
conditions observed in comparable uncontrolled transactions" without first accurately delineating the
subject related party transaction, and without a complete comparability analysis and application of the
arm's length principle.

Meanwhile, if the narrower interpretation in item 2 is intended, then a potential for inconsistent
interpretation arises primarily from multiple connotations of the word "conditions" having meaningful
relevance to the subject of the text-an issue that might also translate into other languages that have such
connotations as well.

While these last comments may seem semantic, in the authors' view it is best to revise any avoidable
potential for inconsistent interpretation of the text. The underlying subject and issues themselves are
often subject to different interpretation even with a clear text-which, in large part, the draft
achieves. Thus, for example, if the intended meaning of"conditions" in the first sentence is the
narrower transactional form, clarifying language would be helpful.

Additional comments

The draft conveys that the arm's length principle is a case-specific and fact-intensive process, one that
must take as its starting point an understanding of the specific facts and circumstances of the tested
controlled transaction and the related parties involved, as well as their functions, assets, and risks. It is
from this basis that comparability analysis proceeds in pursuit of potential comparables.

In light of this and related comments above, the authors suggest a slight revision to the language in
the fourth paragraph on page 9 to say,
                                                   II
        The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing each
        set out a framework of five economically relevant characteristics or comparability factors to be
        kept in mind when considering whether an uncontrolled transaction is comparable to a controlled
        transaction.

As noted above, the summary ofa "typical process for performing a comparability analysis" (on
page I 0) is quite helpful in cross-referencing other guidance, while it also demonstrates welcome
consistency between the guidance offered by the OECD and the UN.

Here, the sequence of steps properly includes the need for a broad-based analysis of the taxpayer's
circumstances. The necessary interplay between "initial review of possible sources of comparable
information" and the step to "select the most appropriate transfer pricing method" is iteratively
expressed en route to identification of potential comparables-conveying a degree of "back and
forth" that often must take place in applying such steps.

Page 11 reinforces that comparability analysis follows from and depends upon:

    •   The background and context of the related party transaction;


                                                                                                  Page 7 of9




                                                        55
      •     Verifying the contractual terms and the conduct of the parties in the related party transaction;

      •     Accurate delineation of the actual controlled transaction with a focus on the economically
            significant characteristics that "allow for the accurate identification of the features of a
            controlled transaction that will be the starting point for comparability analysis;"

      •     Analysis of "all important features of a control led transaction"-including with respect to the
            parties' functions, assets and assumption of economically significant risks; and

      •     The crucial considerations regarding the assumption of risks by the parties in performing a
            functional analysis and the process of delineating a transaction.

  On this point, the draft notes:

            The accurately delineated transaction should be priced taking into account the financial
            consequences ofrisk assumption, as appropriately reallocated (if necessary), and appropriately
            compensating risk management functions, as understood in OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

  Without offering much further detail here, the authors also commend the quality of the illustrations
  and examples provided in the draft. In particular, Box 3. Stylised Case is very useful in itself as a
  "simplified example [that] illustrates the impact of the choice of the tested party when using a one-
  sided method." Furthermore, this example could provide a useful basis for variations that further
  illustrate other relevant issues and concepts discussed in the draft.

  For example, in Box 3 the draft already offers three scenarios represented by the table and
  subsequent text to numerically illustrate the importance ofan accurate delineation of the controlled
  transaction and understanding the parties' contributions of functions, assets and risks assumed-in
  addition to the choice of tested party and transfer pricing method in each case. In the two scenarios
  applying the TNMM to one tested party, the residual profits realized the party not chosen as the
  tested party are also noteworthy and offer further opportunity for useful illustration.

  For example, one might consider another scenario that could further illustrate the potential effects of
  a frequent use of"routine" profit margin calculations throughout the same supply chain-that is, by
  applying the TNMM not only to one but to both parties as separate tested parties.

  In such a case, the illustration could show the manufacturer earning 85 in profit, the distributor 75-
  both using a TNMM-and a residual profit of 290 representing 64 percent of the total profits of 450.
  If this were a realistic scenario for a given taxpayer, it would reveal a need for further inquiry to
  understand more about other parties in the value chain, including their contributions in terms of
  functions, assets, risks assumed, their financial capacity to bear risks associated with the business,
  and other capabilities. Presumably, these contributions would be substantial if they were to justify
  the corresponding returns that arise outside of the manufacturing and sales entities.

Ref: Discussion draft - A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing
Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses

Bureau van Dijk welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Platform for
Collaboration on Tax (the Platform)'s Discussion Draft titled "A Toolkit for
Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing
Analyses" (the Discussion Draft).


General Comments:

Bureau van Dijk commends the work of the Platform in addressing the issue of
"accessing comparable data", particularly in the context of developing countries.

As a firm specializing in business intelligence, and as a leading provider of external,
independent data used for arm's length analysis, Bureau van Dijk is pleased with the
objectivity and thoroughness of the work performed by the Platform. We hope that
the findings outlined in this Toolkit help ensure the continued reliance on the Arm's
Length Principle (ALP) as the basis for Transfer Pricing analysis, to ensure that
profits are allocated fairly across multinational groups.

The reliability of any arm's length analysis is based on the availability and the quality
of the information used. At the core of the Toolkit's concern is the lack of thoroughly
enforced information disclosure requirements for companies in most countries
(especially developing countries), which significantly limit the availability and quality
of information for arm's length analysis. Fomenting the adoption of legislation
requiring companies to disclose qualitative, quantitative and ownership information in
the public domain would go a long way in increasing the availability and quality of
external, independent data for arm's length analysis. Moreover, it would have an
important impact in mitigating corruption and financial crime by increasing
transparency, which is in line with the broader goal of assisting countries protect their
tax bases.

Observations:

Part II. Section 2.4 - Select the most appropriate transfer pricing method

The description in the Discussion Draft of the application of the Transfer Pricing
Methods outlined in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines could benefit from
clarification:

   •   The Discussion Draft states that the Resale Price and the Cost Plus Methods
       are primarily applicable in limited-risk routine situations. However, as
       transactional methods (that should rely primarily on internal comparables),
       both the Resale Price and Cost Plus Methods can be - and in their text-book
       form are often - applied to full-fledged operations. In fact, one could argue
       that limited-risk, routine functions (like contract manufacturing) seldom lend
       themselves to transaction-based methods because most multinational
       enterprises do not enter into comparable, limited-risk relationships with ·
       unrelated third parties (for fear of creating unnecessary competition vis-a-vis
       its other related parties, or for fear of infringement of their intangible property
       by unrelated third parties), and hence offer no internal comparables with
       which to apply these transaction-based methods.
   •   The discussion on the Cost Plus Method, and the cost base that should be
       included in the calculation of the cost mark-up, should make clearer the
       distinction between the Cost Plus Method and the Full-Cost Mark-Up
       (commonly referred to as the "Net Cost Plus" or the "Return on Total
       Operating Costs", which is a profit level indicator specific to the Transactional
       Net Margin Method).
   •   The Discussion Draft states that the Transaction Net Margin Method (TNMM)
       bears some similarities to the Resale Price and Cost Plus Methods. Although
       the Discussion Draft does make clear that the TNMM tests the arm's length
       nature of the controlled transaction at the net profit level of the P&L, and that
       the Resale Price and Cost Plus Methods test it at the gross profit level of the
       P&L, the Discussion Draft should make a clearer distinction between the
       TNMM and the Resale Price and Cost Plus Methods. The TNMM is a profit-
       based method that relies primarily on external comparables. The Resale Price
       and Cost Plus Methods are transaction-based methods that rely primarily on
       internal comparables.
   •   The discussion on the Tested Party in Part II, Section 2.4.l(d) paragraph 2
       could also benefit from further clarification.
            o Whilst it is true that the TNMM and the Resale Price and Cost Plus
               Methods are one-sided methods, the concept of the Tested Party is
               unique to the TNMM.
            o The TNMM is testing the arm's length nature of the controlled
               transaction by reference to the net margins earned by independent
               companies engaged in comparable uncontrolled transactions (i.e., we

                                are testing the net profitability of one or another of the parties involved
                                in the controlled transaction).
                       o        In contrast, the Resale Price and Cost Plus Methods test the arm's
                                length nature of the controlled transaction by reference to the gross
                                profitability earned in comparable uncontrolled transactions (i.e., we
                                are testing the controlled transaction, not any one of the parties
                                involved in the transaction).
                      o         The TNMM is a zero-sum method where one party (typically the
                                Tested Party) earns a routine profit, and any excess profits (or losses)
                                are attributable to the non-routine, risk-taking counter-party in the
                                controlled transaction.
                      o         The Resale Price and Cost Plus Methods (as well as the CUP Method)
                                can yield net operating losses for either or both of the counter-parties
                                in the controlled transaction, yet still be consistent with an arm's length
                                standard. This is because these methods test the arm's length nature of
                                the controlled transaction at the gross profit level of the controlled
                                transaction (or the revenue or cost of goods/services level in the case of
                                the CUP Method), and they do not consider operational inefficiencies
                                below the gross-profit level of the P&L account.

Part II, Section 3.3 - Commercial Databases

The Discussion Draft states that commercial databases offer a universe of
approximately five million global records with revenue and operating profits, and
which meet the basic independence criteria. Bureau van Dijk finds that this figure is
significantly understated. As show in Figure 1, below, the approximate number of
global records that meet the Discussion Draft's basic criteria is nearly 10.5 million.

Appendix 7 - Independence Criteria

For the past 20 years, Bureau van Dijk has been developing an Ownership Database.
The Ownership Database is a database of links. A link establishes an ownership
relationship between 2 entities, a shareholder and a subsidiary. A shareholder might
be a corporation, a private individual, a government or a collectively described entity
(such as the "public" for listed companies). The subsidiary, however, is always a
corporation.

For this reason, the Bureau van Dijk Independence Indicators should be used with
caution. A company with Independence Indicator D (a company with one or more
shareholders owning more than 50% of the shares) could be considered as an
independent comparable for transfer pricing purposes if the company is own by a
private individual. As a result, most transfer pricing analyses relying on external
comparables will apply the Bureau van Dijk Independence Indicators, but include
companies that are owned by private individuals, managers or employees.

Questions:

    1. Does this toolkit effectively help address the challenges identified by
       developing countries in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer
       pricing analysis as part of a tax audit?

The Discussion Draft offers practical solutions to the challenges identified by
developing countries in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer pricing
analysis.

Though the Discussion Draft places emphasis on other approaches, such as safe
harbours, benefit tests, profit splits and other protective measures, the risk of
overstating or understating the transfer price is greater with these approaches than
with the use of foreign comparables. Moreover, whilst many emerging economies
lack information on local com parables, Bureau van Dijk's coverage of information
across emerging economies exceeds 3 million companies (see Figure 2, above).

This is a vast sample of potential comparables from which tax administrations in
emerging economies can draw to establishmore reliable arm's length results. The
reality is that tax administrations in emerging economies, today, do not need to rely
on foreign comparables from developed countries, which would make geographic
comparability more of an issue and could have greater effect on the results. Today,
tax administrations in emerging economies can draw from this universe companies
from similar economies that offer greater comparability for the arm's length analysis.

The combination of the greater availability of company data from emerging
economies, and the application of time-tested, reliable geographic comparability
adjustments described in the Discussion Draft make a stronger case for the use of
foreign comparables by tax administrations in developing countries. The use of safe
harbours, formulary apportionments or other tools that stray from undertaking an
arm's length analysis are more likely to result in double taxation for the multinational
group and more controversy with other tax administrations.

As the Discussion Draft points out, what will help tax administrations the most with
the lack of local comparable data ( especially those in developing countries) is to take
steps requiring the central registration of financial accounts by public and private
companies in their respective countries. Taking this steps will, not only increase the
universe of potential local comparables, but also improve transparency and help
mitigate corruption and financial crime.

   2. How can better use of administrative information, in a way that
      maintains taxpayer confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country
      and regional level?

     3. How could the reliability of potential comparables from other geographic
        markets be tested?

Bureau van Dijk encourages the Platform to run empirical analyses based on
companies that meet basic transfer pricing criteria, and which are located in emerging
economies. We suspect that, when empirical samples from select emerging
economies are run, one may be able to draw clearer conclusions about the reliability
of foreign comparables that are located in countries with economic similarities.

We ran a rudimentary analysis of companies in all manufacturing industries (using
NACE Rev. 2 industry classification codes). We separated the samples based on
geographic regions and analysed the respective companies' 20 l 5 unadjusted EBIT
margins. Figure 6, below, shows the results.

Upper quartile                                                14.21%         12.82%         12.30%
Median                                                         6.23%          8.10%          6.52%
Lower quartile                                                -1.10%          3.84%          2.07%

As shown above, though the ranges differ slightly from one region to another, the
disparity between the respective regional ranges is not dramatic. There is a natural
convergence in the rates of return to the function of manufacturing. A more in-depth
analysis based on a more specific breakdown of industries might yield clearer results
that further support the use of foreign comparables from countries with similar
economic conditions (i.e., emerging economies).

    4. Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a
       lack of comparables not addressed in the discussion draft?

The Discussion Draft did touch briefly on the idea of having emerging economies
take steps toward greater disclosure of financial accounts onto national company
registries. This is likely to be the best approach, and the one more likely to ensure the
proliferation of the ALP. The Discussion Draft, however, seemed to place more
emphasis on approaches that lend themselves to double taxation (like safe harbours,
formulary apportionment, pre-defined margins, etc.).

The Toolkit would benefit from more emphasis on the creation of local, company
information by fomenting the notion of mandatory disclosures of financial accounts
by companies onto the public domain.

Sub: Feedback - Request for comments on a draft toolkit from the Platform for Collaboration on Tax



Thank you for bringing the toolkit consultation to my attention, indeed I'm interested in commenting and
we were already asked our views on TP Week, and I'll make a more detailed response. I'll also spread the
consultation to different networks, both NGOs working directly on WB / IMF related issues and the tax
specific NGOs in the Financial Transparency Coalition, Global Alliance for Tax Justice, and the Tax Justice
Network, to publicise this opportunity to comment on the toolkit, which I find timely.

The initial comments are already below, I think the toolkit asks the right question of localised adaptation
of transfer pricing guidelines, and looking at comparable databases is a good start. However, it could also
look at other adaptations of TP rules in developing countries as practiced for instance by China, and Brazil,
as well as how extractive sector and agricultural export sectors are being taxed through simplified regimes
and adapting to local market conditions. So there are many practices to report in developing countries
in the section where adaptations and adjustments are discussed.

Public accountability may be weak in the proposed greater use of safe harbours, and so we propose public
transparency on country-by-country reporting and beneficial ownership registres as key parts of greater
public accountability. In case of spillover analysis, we're also starting to propose accountability over tax
rulings (e.g. Ireland), and granting of safe harbours and APAs in the developing country context, e.g. a
Finnish-Swedish forestry giant Stora Enso (also an IFC investee) had an APA in the Netherlands that
reduced tax liabilities in Brazil as reported in the recent edition of the Bretton Woods Observer, below:

Dear Sir/Madam

A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing
Analyses

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing
Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses ("the draft toolkit").                            ·

International trade is greatly enhanced by an international tax system that can provide relief from
trading profits being taxed in two (or more) countries, and where possible where there is some
certainty of treatment. It is important that transfer pricing guidance is consistently applied by
countries in order to achieve this, in line with the principles agreed by international consensus and set
out in the OECD's Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations.
The toolkit will need to be updated in future to take account of updates to the OECD's Guidelines as
part of continuing work by governments to improve the consistency and practice of transfer pricing.
Low income countries may also need help in implementing the toolkit.

Detailed comments on the paragraphs on the validity of relying on foreign market data for
comparables are set out in the attached appendix to this letter. In particular, these focus on Appendix
12 of the draft toolkit and the summary of the economic work updating the 2004 study Is Europe One
Market? A transfer pricing economic analysis of Pan-European Comparables Sets by Meenan et al in
relation to the European market.

Please do not hesitate to contact Andre Schaffers (aschaffers@deloitte.com), Alison Lobb
(alobb@deloitte.co.uk) or me if you would like to discuss further.

Yours faithfully

Appendix

1. Draft Toolkit Appendix 12

Section 5.5 dealing with a lack of (local) comparables data includes a repetition of the exercise using
the same approach as Meenan et al. in 20041, but with more recent company data from 2008 - 2014.
The details on the approach used and the conclusions of the findings are available in Appendix 12 of
the draft toolkit.

Based on the findings of the updated study, the draft toolkit concludes that notable heterogeneity may
exist in profitability ratios even in the European context.

Upon analysis of the approach and conclusions, several differences have been identified between the
draft toolkit and the original approach used by Meenan et al. Each of these differences may have had
an impact on the findings and the conclusions drawn.

2. Key differences in approaches applied

•   NACE codes: The 2004 study uses NACE Rev.1 codes. The classification of companies has been
    updated since, with the use of NACE Rev.2 codes. Some of the selected NACE Rev.2 codes in the
    draft toolkit are not related to the industry tested, jeopardising the representativeness of
    conclusions. For instance, for Automotive Manufacturing, the 2004 study only focuses on
    automotive vehicles & accessories. The draft toolkit also includes the manufacture of office and
    shop furniture, the manufacture of machinery for mining, quarrying and a few other codes.

•   Statistical testing: the lack of details on the actual hypothesis tests being carried out makes it
    impossible to directly compare with Meenan et al.'s 2004 study. In particular the null hypothesis in
    the draft toolkit is not clearly defined. If the studies have not been performed robustly and in
    similar fashions, comparing the outcomes will not be appropriate. 2

Sets.
http: //ec. europa .eu/taxation customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/forum 7 /europe one market white
  paper feb18.pdf

2 Further detailed questions on this point are:
       What quantities are being compared across countries - Interquartile range, P25 alone, P75 alone, P25 or
       P75, P25 and P75?
       If the "2N" degree-of-freedom test that is being used, how are single countries being identified as violating
       the null hypothesis? We understand that further country-by-country tests are being carried out for this,
       though again the precise test is not stated in the draft toolkit.
    Additionally, the following technical issues and differences with Meenan et al. are identified:
       The author's convention for testing samples with an even number of observations is not explained (See
       footnote 52 on page 29 of Meenan et al.)
       End of section 2: it is not clear whether the authors of the draft toolkit mean chi-squared tests with 2N-1 and
       N-1 degrees of freedom. A miscounting will cause an error in the p-value being reported.
       Meenan et al. explain the preparation of their data to make it suitable for chi-squared testing on page 30 of
       the 2004 study i.e. splitting the dataset in two equally-sized, ordered subsets around the median, and then
       considering the 1st and 3rd quartiles as the medians of these two halves. It is not clear whether the draft
       toolkit uses the same methodology or how the set up the chi-squared tests was done.
       the draft toolkit does not provide a cross-check of its results using other methods, whereas the 2004 study
       of Meenan et al does.
       The authors of the draft toolkit do not mention how they take care of contingency tables with cells that
       contain small entries, which can render the results of chi-squared tests unreliable.

•   Outliers: Footnote 128 in section 3 of the draft toolkit states the revised convention for removal of
    outliers in profitability ratios. The table below provides an overview of the different ranges used per
    profit level indicator (PU) to identify and remove outliers.



      PLI used                           2004 study                         Draft toolkit



     Return On Assets                    Min: -10%                          Min: -2%
     (Manufacturing industry)
                                         Max: 20%                           Max: 24%



     Operating Profit Margin             Min: -5%                           Min: -4%
     (Distribution industry)
                                         Max: 15%                           Max: 18%



    Different boundaries have been applied in the 2004 study and the 2016 update. The definition of
    outliers should be contrasted with the equivalent process in Meenan et al. so that a comparison can
    be made.

    In addition, it appears that the draft toolkit removes outliers on the full sample of companies,
    irrespective of the industry and sector to be tested. The 2004 study verifies and removes outliers
    depending on the PU to be tested per industry.

•   Date of incorporation: The 2004 study uses an extra criterion for the search strategy: all
    companies that are incorporated less than 5 years ago are excluded from the set. This step is
    performed to remove start-up companies. The draft toolkit does not make reference to this step.

•   Region: The definition of the region under review is not clearly specified. The Meenan et al. study
    considered the then 16 members of the European Union.




3. Deloitte study for the European Commission in 2016

A full update of the 2004 study has been prepared by Deloitte in 2016 with the use of the most recent
data available. That study follows closely the approach of 2004 and is available on the website of the
European Commission3• This study also includes additional testing to validate the conclusions reached.
It does not, however, cover the 2008 - 2009 crisis period now covered by the draft toolkit that
possibly showed higher volatility in the observations.

EY comments on the Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing
Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses



Dear Madam/Sir,

Ernst & Young (EY) welcomes the opportunity provided to comment on the discussion draft
titled A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer
Pricing Analyses (the Toolkit), as published on the OECD's website on 24 January 2017. We
appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the discussions about this topic. This letter
presents the collective view of EY's global international tax network.

General comments
The Toolkit seems to address more topics than just the difficulties in accessing
comparability data. The Toolkit provides guidance on a broader range of transfer pricing
issues and the guidance seems practical as well as helpful for practitioners that do not
have extensive transfer pricing experience.

Accordingly, we believe it would be helpful if the Toolkit would clarify how this document
relates to other transfer pricing guidance issued by the various parties to the "Platform for
Collaboration on Tax" (the Platform), specifically in the case of differences between the
various other sources of guidance/regulations and the guidance included in the Toolkit.
We also believe it would be helpful to clarify the purpose of the various country practices
included in the boxes throughout the document. Does the fact they are being mentioned in
the Toolkit transform these techniques into a best practice in emerging countries? In our
view, some of the practices may be controversial or even not desirable. Clarification of the
purpose of the inclusion of country practices is likely to prevent such practices spreading
to other jurisdictions without careful consideration.

We also believe that the Toolkit strongly focuses on the challenges and limitations
experienced by tax authorities when conducting transfer pricing audits. In order to reach a
more balanced approach to transfer pricing in emerging countries, it would be beneficial if
the challenges faced by taxpayers be studied and described as well (e.g., weak institutional
environment, tax administration's lack of capacity). Once a tax authority decides to adopt
the arm's length principle as part of its tax policy, we believe it should also take into




                                             77
consideration the cost of the proper infrastructure to support the tax audits in such
specialty areas.

In our view, the Toolkit provides a good description of the various challenges arising as the
result of difficulties in accessing comparables data. In addition, we believe the Toolkit
demonstrates that there is not one clear solution. We therefore recommend that the
Platform emphasize that flexibility and reasonableness from tax administrations is
required when taxpayers make a reasonable effort to address some of the challenges
encountered, e.g., by means of comparability adjustments.

We welcome the repeated statement that the selection of the most appropriate transfer
pricing method, on the basis of a detailed factual analysis, is central to the application of
the arm's length principle, and in many cases, is likely to have a greater impact on the ,
outcome than the accuracy of the data used in the method's application. However,
inclusion of the profit split method in Part Ill (approaches in the absence of comparables),
notwithstanding the caveats made, might be interpreted as the profit split being
acceptable because of the lack of comparables. Therefore, we strongly recommend
clarification of this point.

Finally, we note that a lack of international consensus about (potential) solutions for the
challenges in accessing comparability data could lead to additional disputes and additional
cases of double taxation. We therefore support the ongoing work of the Platform in this
respect.

Making use of available data
Section 3.2 of the Toolkit states that, in practice, application of the arm's length principle
is heavily reliant on external comparables (i.e., transactions between two independent
parties, neither of which is a party to the controlled transaction). Although we believe this
is generally correct. in our experience internal comparables (l.e., comparable transactions
between one party to the controlled transaction and an independent party) are used more
often than this conclusion suggests. Specifically when dealing with developing markets
and smaller markets, multinational enterprises sometimes use third party distributors.
Such arrangements might be used to support the transfer pricing.

Other sources of comparability data that are often overlooked or rejected by tax
administrations are quotes and price offers. While we acknowledge that in principle such
information is theoretically not ideal, it would be helpful to provide guidance on the use of
such data, e.q.. on the circumstances in which they may be used to support the transfer
pricing. In our experience, there can be cases in which such data is practically speaking the
best data available.

Another way to potentially expand the amount of comparables data, is to use the full
range instead of the interquartile range. We agree with the prevailing view that the
interquartile range can be used to account for unidentifiable and unquantifiable
comparability differences. However, it would be helpful if guidance were provided about
the trade-off between being conservative regarding such unknown differences and the



                                                                                     Page 2 of 6

                                              78
need for a sufficiently sizeable set of com parables. In our view, it can be appropriate to
consider the full range in certain circumstances, where the set of comparables is
reasonably reliable, and not to 'routinely' rely on statistical approaches. This may be
particularly relevant when using internal comparables. While this view finds support in the
current guidance, a stronger statement in this regard would be helpful as, in our
experience, the use of the interquartile range seems to-be the standard and default
practice for many tax administrations. For similar reasons, we believe the suggestion
included in par 6.1, to limit the application of the range concept to relatively small ranges
is not correct and we recommend it be deleted.

In some (developing) countries, transfer pricing legislation also covers transactions with
third parties, for instance if they involve commodities. It may also include transactions
with joint ventures (JVs) which effectively transact on an independent basis. This adds a
challenge to the overall issue of finding reliable comparables, especially where external
comparable uncontrolled prices (CUPs) are not available or not reliable unless adjusted. In
these cases, profitability may be tested only on one side of a transaction, which party is
not necessarily the least complex entity. It would be helpful to elaborate on these cases.
First, we believe transfer pricing legislation should not cover such transactions with third
parties or JVs. Second, if nevertheless such transactions are included, we recommend
practical guidance on finding com parables for these transactions be included in the final
report. In our view, it can be helpful in these instances to focus on price setting processes
and negotiation procedures, and less on the outcome as such, to support the transaction
has taken place under arm's length circumstances.

Making comparability adjustments
The Toolkit mentions that many countries take a very cautious approach in the application
of comparability adjustments and notes the "comparability adjustment paradox" - that
small adjustments will not materially alter the resulting arm's length range of outcomes
and large adjustments may in fact mask more fundamental differences in comparability
with the controlled transaction. While this may be true, we note that there are cases
where: a) it is fairly clear that an adjustment would probably enhance comparability, and
b) the direction of the adjustment is known. The question arises whether in these
instances it is better to make no adjustment, merely because the reliability of the
adjustment cannot be fully guaranteed.

In practice, there are many cases in which it may be appropriate to consider a foreign
exchange (forex) risk adjustment, e.q., when testing a local distributor which assumes a
forex risk. In practice, a benchmarking study would often yield a set of "second tier
distributors" which are likely to buy from first tier importers and sell further. Limitations
with respect to the amount of information available regarding the comparables would
make it difficult to irrefutably demonstrate that those comparables do not assume forex
risk, even when such an assumption is very reasonable.

We believe it may be helpful to include some guidance on additional specific comparability
adjustments, for example, the acceptability of adjustments for volume, specifically in



                                                                                     Page 3 of 6

                                              79
relation to commodities. In our experience, there is controversy around this kind of
comparability adjustments in practice.

Use of foreign comparables
The proposal of country risk premium does, in our view, not take into account experiences
in certain countries (e.g., in Latin America). The proposal in the Toolkit seems
conceptually flawed where it seems to suggest that a higher risk profile should necessarily
lead to a higher actual return. In our view, it would be helpful to clarify that higher returns
will be expected a priori from riskier activities and assets. On an ex post basis, the financial
results in riskier environments (e.g., emerging countries) are more volatile, not just
higher.

Some developing countries with no local comparables may have access to financial data
regarding independent comparables in neighboring markets. Even though such countries
may show similarities, there may also be significant differences. Comparability factors to
consider include whether those companies derive the majority of their revenue from sales
in markets other than the one where they are headquartered, local tariffs, local
government protectionist policies towards certain sectors/industries, number of
players/competitors in such market, recessions, inflation, and foreign exchange risks.

Finally, the way companies operate in developing countries is often different from their
operations in developed countries. Therefore, it should not lightly be assumed that the
functions performed are similar to those of group entities in developed countries.
Therefore, the accurate delineation of the transaction, including the functional analysis, is
very important, and may be even more important than focusing on availability of local
data.

Safe harbors
The Toolkit mentions that for the purpose of identifying data on comparables suitable for
setting a safe harbor margin, a solution would be to use data already in the hands of the
tax administration, sourced primarily from tax return information. We agree that this
could be a potential solution in the absence of sufficient comparability data (available to
taxpayers), in particular when combined with an "opt-out" or "opt-in" mechanism.
However, if a taxpayer does not want to make use of the safe harbor rule, it may be very
difficult to provide a robust alternative analysis, in particular if the lack of comparability
data was the main reason for the existence of the safe harbor rule in the first place.
Practically, this could seriously impede the effectiveness of the opt-out rules and make the
safe harbor rules, de facto, mandatory. Therefore, we recommend the use of opt-in rules,
instead of opt-out rules. Furthermore, we believe that a stronger statement should be
made with respect to the transparency and fairness of the approach used by the tax
administration to determine the safe harbor. The Toolkit refers to the transparency as a
good practice. We recommend that this transparency be mandatory.

The Toolkit also mentions bilateral safe harbors. In our view, the use of bilateral or even
multilateral agreements has the potential to significantly decrease the number of transfer
pricing disputes and help overcome the problem of lack of comparables. A mechanism


                                                                                      Page 4 of 6

                                              80
similar to the Multilateral Instrument as per OECD BEPS Action 15 may help introducing
multilateral safe harbors on a large scale.

Secret comparables
We recommend the Platform provide additional guidance and take a firmer position
towards the use of secret comparables. The Toolkit includes some examples of countries
that allow the use of secret comparables by the tax administration. In our view, tax
administrations should not be allowed to use secret comparables to adjust the transfer
pricing of taxpayers that have taken a reasonable position. Also for that reason, we
believe that it is very important that detailed guidance be provided regarding the
standards to be applied and procedures to be followed (and documented) by tax
administrations when compiling sets of comparables, for whatever purposes, based on
information that is only accessible to them.

We recommend that the Toolkit encourage tax administrations to disclose, on a no-name
basis, comparables data for certain functional profiles, obtained from the tax returns, to
guide taxpayers, possibly as an intermediary step towards the implementation of an
obligation for the disclosure of companies' financial information.

Commodities
Section 2.4.2 of the Toolkit addresses "Commodity pricing and prescriptive approaches"
and, among others, touches upon the issue of using quoted prices for controlled
transactions involving an intermediary company. We would like to point out that when an
intermediary is involved, it is not always required to make an adjustment to the CUPs to
establish an intermediary's margin. In some industries it is predetermined that a third
party sale may involve an intermediary too, and that therefore an adjustment to external
CUPs would arguably not be required. It would be helpful if this scenario would be included
in the Tool kit.

Furthermore, it would be helpful if guidance were included regarding some more specific
comparability adjustments, for example, on volume differences. We refer to our comments
above.

Anti-avoidance measures
As the Toolkit acknowledges, the topic of anti-avoidance measures is very broad. The
examples described seem to be generic (relevant to intra-group transactions), and not
limited to the lack of comparables data. We question whether the Toolkit should address
such general anti-avoidance measures, specifically since the OECD BEPS project has
already covered these.

  The approach described with respect to the deduction of royalties is of particular concern.
· It is suggested that countries could introduce a cap on royalty deductions, based on the
  ratio of royalties payable to EBITDA, or similar. The amended OECD guidance (par. 6.144)
  strongly rejects a rule of thumb approach. Furthermore, the analogy of such cap with the
  approach recommended in the BEPS Action 4 report is not correct. Where a multinational



                                                                                    Page 5 of 6

                                             81
enterprise may have certain freedom to choose between the use of capital or debt. such
freedom is not present when dealing with intangibles. The tax authorities of an entity
providing the right to use an intangible to an associated entity will require an arm's length
compensation. When the receiving country would restrict the deduction of the royalty
payment, this will inevitably lead to double taxation.

Examples
In our view, the inclusion of examples is helpful. In general, we believe the Toolkit could be
enhanced by including more examples where the practical approach used by the taxpayer
is accepted, as opposed to being challenged by the tax administration. The examples
throughout the Toolkit seem to be extremely simplified. It would be helpful if the Toolkit
more explicitly mentions this and if it were clarified that these examples are merely to
illustrate the concept or issue discussed.

Without being exhaustive, we have commented below on some of the examples provided.

In our view, the example in Box 2, Sugar Producer, is not complete. The conclusion seems
to rely on product comparability, and not based on an analysis of the functions performed.

Section 5.4.3 in part II discusses netback approaches. When a netback adjustment is
discussed for the transportation cost. it would be helpful to clarify that the tax authorities
should consider the same transportation route as chosen/ used by a taxpayer and not to
suggest any alternative route which, in the view of the tax authority, may be more
economically justifiable, as we have seen in practice. Moreover, we believe that netback
approaches require a deep functional analysis that was not provided in examples described
in the Toolkit (i.e. box 15 and box 16).

Sub: Our feedback about the toolkit of global platform



Dear Julia:

I hope everything is great over there.

I have been sharing your request with many colleagues from different sectors to achieve enough
comments to fortify the toolkit proposed.

I'm also doing good at the university with my colleagues. We have created GIFID (Grupo de investigaci6n
en Fsicalidad internacional y desarrollo) to share our point of views in meetings like IMF-WB in october
2016. My colleague Juan Carlos Campuzano (JC) met with Mrs Victoria Perry too, in december 2016 at
meeting organized by UN.

JC and I were analyzing the toolkit proposed and I want to share you the points written below:

    1.   Legal national framework of each country is limited to be possible the application of many
         procedures or to make possible many of your suggestions. It could be logical but not possible,
         because the laws of national bodies haven't been developed including these scenarios.
         Harmonization of laws along all these countries must be applied and the role of this platform
         could be focused in the coordination of this achievement in mid-long term.
    2.   Lack of transparency is not only about Tax Administration (TA). Companies' superintendence
         must be included in capacity building aid programs trying to reinforce their activities,
         empowering the transparency and data source for TA in their determinations, for example, with
         "residuals" suggested in this toolkit like the last option when nothing more works in the audit
         process. Companies' superintendence in every country must be the data source, but nowadays
         they are the lack of source.
    3.   The toolkit proposed requires to be "approved" by TA more than the others. Only the auditors
         and their experience along these countries could reinforce the idea of this toolkit really works
         for all of them. The aim is to make sure that the toolkit gets approved by 25-40% of TAs.
              •   I'm grateful for this open invitation as part of CSO, but TA knows better their limitations
                  and experience to solve the problems faced in their work.
              •   Due the technical process; the Tax Administration from undeveloped countries (UC)
                  must be invited to give an official or at least a technical feedback (considering the legal
                  national framework, their own realities in every country).

For undeveloped countries, the solution might be more capacity building program inclusion of nationals
Enterprise Superintendence, laws harmonization in all UC, and the validation/approval of any proposal
from Global platform including official feedbacks of UC TA. The global platform in this toolkit and every

future proposal could develop an important duty like coordinator, analyst, and proponent. So that global
platform makes possible the real inclusion of experiences, realities in a transparency and consistency
framework.

I hope this comments could be useful for you.

Our group is open to have a conversation with you if you find necessary to be precise in any point. We
expect the best for you and your task in progress.

 Introduction
We believe that the Toolkit is most helpful and is welcomed as a practical tool for assisting tax
authorities in cases where there is difficulty in assessing com parables data for transfer pricing
analyses. It is apparent that a large degree of time and care has been spent on the development
of the Toolkit. The Toolkit is clear, well-constructed, and provides useful examples for the
application of commonly used transfer pricing concepts.
Availability of data
We recognise the fact that the Toolkit will be of great value to tax authorities where country
specific com parables data is available. However, from a practical experience of using
commercially available databases, we are aware that often, e.g. in Africa and South America
there is insufficient data. In response to this, some tax authorities have made it clear that
alternative data is acceptable e.g. the South African Revenue Services and the preference for
pan-European com parables. Where there is a significant lack of local com parables, we
recommend that tax authorities are encouraged to take a similar practical step.


In some regions, this issue of the lack of comparables also limits the application of other
valuable suggestions as to how alternative/ additional comparables can be sought. An example
of this is where the Toolkit discusses the use of data from countries in close geographic
proximity. We note that in Africa for example, the most developed economies in terms of fiscal
bases, political stability and resources have a wide geographic dispersion (aside from Tanzania
and Kenya). Another example, is where the toolkit discusses the use of sovereign credit ratings or
other equivalents to derive a set of potential comparables, but again in Africa, there are very few
countries with reported sovereign credit ratings.

We recommend therefore that a pre-amble be introduced to the Toolkit which states that the
Toolkit is primarily for use where local comparables are available or where there is a general
acceptance of foreign com parables by the relevant tax authority (preferably defined data sets). In
the absence of acceptance by a tax authority for the use of foreign comparables, the Toolkit may
not be as useful with regards its intended purpose. We suggest that a collective effort (and
further research if needed) should be pursued by tax authorities (perhaps through forums such
as ATAF) to reach consensus on the issue of the acceptability of foreign com parables. In addition,
the collection of local com parables data which is made available for transfer pricing assessment
purposes is encouraged.


Safe harbours
  Carefully constructed safe harbours are often an effective tool in providing certainty for both tax
  authorities as well as MNEs in the absence of local comparables and we welcome the guidance
  provided on safe harbours in the Toolkit. However would like to emphasise that the use of safe
  harbours should not become a long term alternative to the collection of publicly available local
· com parables data for transfer pricing analyses. It should be made clear that the collection of
  local comparables data which is made available for transfer pricing assessment purposes is the
  most preferred scenario in the long term.

Anti-avoidance
The UK has introduced new legislation as of 1 April 2017 dealing with corporate interest
restriction rules. We suggest the removal of references to the UK in this section as, in our view,
the UK have departed somewhat from the position stated in this section ("purely arm's length
approach" and references to the "Worldwide Debt Cap provision" in Part Ill - 8).


Conclusion
We are encouraged by the development of the Toolkit in assisting with the assessment of
potential comparables, but conclude that there is still a considerable amount of work that is
needed to provide an appropriate level of local comparables and/ or reach consensus amongst
tax authorities on the use of foreign comparables. We do acknowledge that where there are local
comparables or there is clarity provided by tax authorities on alternative data sets, the Toolkit will
be a highly effective manual in the assessment of potential comparables .

Sub: Draft toolkit designed to help developing countries address the lack of com parables for transfer
pricing analyses



Dear Sir/Madam.



Please find some comments of Georgia Revenue Service, on a draft toolkit designed to help developing
countries address the lack of comparables for transfer pricing analyses

Regarding to Transfer Pricing adjustments we would highlight 2 issues which might have a very important
impact on the results of TP audit in Georgia.



Country risk adjustment:

We agree that differences between geographical market might lead tax auditors to the wrong conclusion
if they use foreign comparable from very different market but also we doubt that using country risk
adjustment can guarantee more exact results, in all cases, and not on the contrary.

Georgia's opinion on country risk adjustment while evaluation financial controlled transactions is the
following:

If Georgian company (borrower of loan) has credit rating B+ or lower than B+ while country's rating also
is B+ (It's important that rating does not exceed rating of country itself or "country ceiling" is used) and
we find as comparable bonds issued by, for example, US Company with the same credit rating (B+ in that
case) issued in the same date, with the same maturity and all other comparability factors are satisfied.

If we use country risk adjustment we should assume that when all other comparability conditions are met
we should still adjust the interest rate of loan borrowed by Georgian company by about 5% (approach
used by Georgina tax payer) because once government bond issued by US was 5% lower than government
bond issued by Georgia.

That adjustment means that any Georgian bond/loans should have 5% higher coupon/interest than
American bond when all other conditions are satisfied. If we see even one case that while all comparability
factors are met bond issued by Georgian company has lower coupon than bond issued by American
company with the same credit rating that automatically means that adjustment was wrong.

opinion is that we should use "country ceiling" and always search for foreign bonds issued by companies
which has the same credit rating as the Georgian borrower company which is the same or lower rating
than Georgia, taking into consideration "country ceiling". That would mean that country risk does not




                                                    89
limit the company's possibility to repay the loan therefore does not have influence on the interest rate.
Country risk adjustment is not appropriate because does not provide the possibility of the exact results.
In addition, country risk adjustment is indirectly used while calculating credit rating of the borrower
company (noting Georgia as country of risk) and using the principle "country ceiling" which means that a
company can't have higher credit worthiness than the country where it operates.




Currency devaluations since 2015:

The report misses one important aspect, which make crucial for developing countries, during last couple
of years and relates to currency devaluations.

Another big problem to which Georgia and probably many other developing countries face since the year
2015 is significant strength of USD against currencies of many developing countries in the region. (Georgia,
Azerbaijan, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, etc). To illustrate the substance of the problem, we will
provide detail example from our practice:

We are finalizing TP audit of Georgian company (tested party) which is contract manufacturer. Controlled
transaction is sale offinished goods to parent company. We used TNMM as the most appropriate method,
PLI -EBIT/operating expenses, database-Amadeus, geographical area-eastern Europe. we got about 12
comparables (Romanian, Polish companies mostly). We calculated interquartile range and got the
following result:




                                                    EBIT/operating fell into the
                     year        price of product
                                                    expenses       market range

Between the years 2014 and 2015 nothing has changed, price was even slightly decreased, all functions,
assets, risks, remained the same but because of devaluations of Georgian currency against USD we got
high margin which fell into the range because our comparable companies did not experience such high
currency risk. Georgian company occurs most of expenses in Georgian Lari, while receives revenue in USD
that factor was reason of their positive margin, while the price was not consistent to market principles.

We needed to make the adjustment using average currency trend against USD but could not find any clue
which would guarantee more exact results.

                                     TAXATION
       Comments to the Platform for Collaboration on Tax Draft Toolkit for addressing
          difficulties in accessing comparables data for transfer pricing analyses

  ICC welcomes the opportunity to comment on the draft toolkit for addressing difficulties in accessing
  comparables data for transfer pricing analyses, developed by the Platform for Collaboration on Tax.

 In general terms, ICC commends this initiative, as we believe that the work performed by the Platform
 for Collaboration on Tax will enable and enhance the position of both tax authorities and taxpayers,
 particularly developing countries in regard to transfer pricing controversies. Whilst substantial work
 remains to be done, ICC applauds the efforts made and the direction taken so far.

 The wide scope intended to be covered by the document may be rather ambitious but any advance in
 this direction may result in relevant benefits for taxpayers and tax authorities. It is essential to reduce
 the administrative burden and compliance costs and to move forward towards a mutual understanding
 between both parties. To this end, providing Tax Authorities with adequate training and tools is critical
 to be able to get balanced and technical discussions during tax audits.

 ICC believes that it is crucial to provide tax authorities, especially in developing countries, with
 internationally consistent tools and standards in order for them to make an assessment on the
 appropriateness of transfer prices based on the arm's length principle. We strongly support the
 application of the arm's length principle as the basis for any legal/administrative development and it
 should be viewed as the common ground for developing any discussion. This will ultimately benefit not
 only the respective tax authority, but also the taxpayer, as it would increase legal certainty.


 Part II: Issues arising when conducting a comparability analysis

. In general terms, Part II is a very complete manual of the main issues on transfer pricing and can be
  used as reference material supplementing the OECD Guidelines and local regulations.

 Particularly in developing countries, it is difficult to find comparable transactions to determine transfer
 prices in line with the arm's length principle and therefore widening of the geographic market of the
 tested party might be reasonable. This is largely because the comparability of a transaction does not
 stop at the border of a country in which the tested party is resident for tax purposes, but usually can be
 applied within a wider geographic region. We agree that reliance on foreign comparables may be a
 simple and feasible approach, especially for margin-based methods.

 The Discussion Draft has a strong focus on the underlying data for a comparability analysis; it is very
 detailed on the mechanical aspects of identifying and reviewing comparables, but does not address
 the assessment of risk of inappropriate transfer pricing in any detail. This increases the likelihood of
 disputes arising, and makes it less likely that the process will be efficient for either taxpayer or tax
 authority. For example, a taxpayer may have provided a detailed and thorough transfer pricing
 analysis, which the tax authority is unable to substantiate using the tools and information at their
 disposal. By failing to carry out a proper assessment of the risk of incorrect transfer pricing, it is very
 possible that the tax authority will put forward a proposed transfer pricing adjustment which is not
 justified and gives rise to a costly, and ultimately fruitless, dispute.

 Further, we would like to point out that the comparability analysis should also include a detailed
 functional and risk analysis of the parties concerned. This is, in fact, the basis for any benchmark
 study in order to identify comparable transactions. Therefore, it is also necessary to provide further
 guidance on the functional and risk profile of certain types of foreign engagement (e.g. distribution
 subsidiaries) in the Discussion Draft.

 A general loosening of screening filters as suggested in the Discussion Draft (see Sec. 4-2, p, 33 of
 the Discussion Draft) may, on the one hand, increase the pool of information available for
 comparability studies. On the other hand, there is a potential risk of how to address the loosening of
 screening filters. Both tax authorities and taxpayers would have the opportunity to take
 advantage of lower requirements on the comparability, which would inevitably widen the gap between
 the views of the respective case of both parties. The same concern applies for the proposal of less
 rigid independence criteria when conducting benchmarking analysis, which could be a simplified
 option if applied homogeneously. It may also improve the number of potential comparables in a
 scenario of scarcity.

 Another possibility would be to reduce the requirements on the number of comparable transactions
 needed. The screening filters could remain by using the international standard, but the number of
 comparable transactions necessary is reduced. Furthermore, it is crucial that every country has legal
 disclosure obligations, so that the databases are able to gather information and the intensity of
 companies and transactions recognized in the databased is increased (see Sec. 3.3 p, 22 et seq. of
 the Discussion Draft).

 A good option for the respective determination and justification of transfer prices is the internal arm's
 length comparison. (see Sec. 3A p. 26 of the Discussion Draft)

 ICC would like to raise a concern with tax authorities' potential use of confidential information as
 secret com parables (see Section 4.1. 1, p, 32), which we believe should be strongly avoided. It would
 be preferable to provide verification of the reliability of the analysis, making publicly available a
 detailed description of the analysis, including the criteria used in selecting data for inclusion and/ or
 aggregated results, as is proposed in the toolkit In this regard, it is essential to ensure that both tax
 authorities and tax payers have the same tools and information available in order to defend their
 respective positions.

 Comparability adjustments (Section 5 of Part II of the Toolkit)
 With respect to the use of adjustments, this appears to be a good option as it would help solve
 problems arising from the lack of sufficient quality data. In this case, it should be guaranteed that
 taxpayers and tax authorities apply them in a similar manner. There is concern about the technical
 difficulties that may arise when applying them and that specific training may be needed by tax
 authorities

 In this section, comparability adjustments have been discussed and it is recommended that capacity
 adjustments should also form part of such adjustments. Capacity adjustment is an adjustment carried
 out to eliminate the functional and economic differences created by varied levels of capacity at which
 the taxpayer and comparable enterprises are operating.

 To improve the quality of comparables, an economic/ comparability adjustment to account for the
 differences in the level of capacity utilization by the comparables and the tested party can be
 calculated.

 Taking into consideration that the toolkit is designed for the benefit of emerging markets, it is pertinent
 to note that the industries are still developing and have not reached their optimal stage. Thus,
 underutilization of capacity is a common phenomenon and a capacity adjustment will result in
 improved comparability while undertaking an economic analysis for determination of arm's length
 range.

 Use of multiple year data (Section 5 and 6.1 of Part II of the Toolkit)
 It has been rightly noted in Section 5.3 of the Toolkit that timing differences in accounting standards
 can be mitigated by using multiple year data. The use of multiple year data further captures market
 cycles and reduces the variability I distortions in the financial results arising from the use of single year
 data. Further, in most cases the current year data is generally not available and hence the emphasis
 on only the use of current year data may lead to the rejection of potentially good comparables. In
 addition, as stated in Section 6.1 of Part II of the Toolkit, the use of a range (e.g.: inter-quartile range)
 instead of an arithmetic mean leads to a better comparison by eliminating the extreme results.


 Part Ill: Approaches to applying internationally accepted principles in the absence of
 comparables

 ICC also supports setting up safe harbours as a simplification measure, with companies having the
 option to use them or not (as long as an alternative arm's length outcome can be demonstrated}.

 We believe that the use of anti-avoidance measures would also be a good initiative with the condition
 that they are used to solve valid high-risk issues and not as a hidden revenue maximising rule
 established only in tax authorities' favor. In that sense, measures should be taken in order to reduce
 the risk of double taxation.

 Standardization of reporting financial information by companies (Section 2 of Part Ill of the Toolkit)
 The Discussion Draft highlights the importance of an internationally accepted electronic reporting
 format. In this regard, the extensible Business Reporting Language ("XBRL") is an information format
 standard that enables automated, global sharing of business information as contained in company
 ledgers, income statements, cash flow, balance sheets as well as textual information included within
 footnotes and other requirements of business reporting.

 Implementing XBRL reporting by emerging markets will not only help to facilitate easy access to
 financial information, but also improve in establishing comparability. XBRL helps in streamlining and
 structuring data and reporting in a standardized format which consequently results in improving
 transparency and efficiency in financial reporting. Reliability and adequacy of financial information of a
 company plays an important role in deciding comparability of such company with the taxpayer and
 thus, XBRL can be used as a tool in achieving that.

 Advance Pricing Arrangements ("APA'J (Section 7 of Part Ill of the Toolkit)
 APAs are gradually emerging as a game changer in the transfer pricing space with a greater number
 of taxpayers exercising this option to reduce litigation arising out of Transfer Pricing issues. By
 concluding APAs on a large scale, emerging markets could generate revenue on one hand and attract
 foreign investments on the other. Specific programs for industry-specific APAs, and for small and
 medium enterprises, could be considered that allow differentiation on the basis of facts, while keeping
 comparability criteria largely consistent. However, filing APAs is resource intensive, not only for tax
 authorities but also for taxpayers. Nevertheless, both parties need to ensure that the process is
 conducted in a reasonable time frame in order to avoid uncertainty.

 Guidance on application of quantitative filters (Appendix 8 of the Toolkit)
 Appendix 8 of the Toolkit refers to the typical process of identifying comparable companies and the
 requirement of application of diagnostic ratios have been dealt with. However, recommendations
 should be made to provide broad guidelines on the quantitative filters to be applied in order to identify
 comparable companies in different industries (e.g. various kinds of Services, Manufacturing,
 Distribution, etc.). For instance, in case of a distributor/ marketing and sales support service provider,
 the threshold applied (upper cap) on a filter such as Advertisement and Marketing Expenses to Sales
 may not be the same relevant threshold as for a routine software developmenU Information
 Technology enabled service provider. In other words, there could be quantitative differences in
 applying the same filters across industries. Recommendations on the broad guiding principles for
 application of quantitative filters are of prime importance.

  The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
  Commission on Taxation

  ICC is the world business organization, whose mission is to promote open trade and
  investment and help business meet the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly
  integrated world economy.

  Founded in 1919, and with interests spanning every sector of private enterprise, ICC's global
  network comprises over 6 million companies, chambers of commerce and business
  associations in more than 130 countries. ICC members work through national committees in
  their countries to address business concerns and convey ICC views to their respective
  governments.

  The fundamental mission of ICC is to promote open international trade and investment and
  help business meet the challenges and opportunities of globalization. ICC conveys
  international business views and priorities through active engagement with the United
  Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
  Development (OECD), the G20 and other intergovernmental forums.

  The ICC Commission on Taxation promotes transparent and non-discriminatory treatment of
  foreign investment and earnings that eliminates tax obstacles to cross-border trade and
  investment. The Commission is composed of more than 150 tax experts from companies and
  business associations in approximately 40 countries from different regions of the world and
  all economic sectors. It analyses developments in international fiscal policy and legislation
  and puts forward business views on government and intergovernmental projects affecting
  taxation. Observers include representatives of the International Fiscal Association {IFA),
  International Bar Association (IBA), Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD
  {BIAC), Business Europe and the United Nations Committee of Experts on International
  Cooperation in Tax Matters.

               Oil and Gas Taxation and Regulatory Dialogue

Re: Request for comments on DISCUSSION DRAFT: A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in
Accessing Com parables Data for Transfer Pricing Analysis




The Oil and Gas Taxation and Regulatory Dialogue of the International Tax and Investment
Center is pleased to submit the following overview comments on the Discussion Draft. We look
forward to working on elements of future work as envisioned in the Discussion Draft, and as
noted at the end of this comment letter.




Comment 1: We believe that as an overall matter, the detail and descriptions contained in the
Toolkit can be an important resource for developing countries. We do believe that while there
is a significant amount of additional detailed analysis in this document, to be most practical, it
would be helpful to insert even additional detail and work specifically through numerical
examples to show precisely how an adjustment is actually calculated and what the numerical
results would be. Perhaps some of these specific cases can be worked as part of the additional
work in a subsequent phase, since such examples would help make the resource as practical as
possible.




Comment 2: With respect to oil and gas extractive activities and particularly for crude oil, we
believe that comparable uncontrolled pricing often exists or is available by means of reference
to readily available published data. The availability of actual or benchmark prices, and the use
of widely recognized quality and location differentials, provide a major opportunity to simplify
transfer pricing for this commodity. Therefore, one priority focus of the toolkit could be to
provide additional detail and support for developing practical and defensible arm's length
values for crude oil. This is potentially "low hanging fruit" which could provide value for




                                                97
 developing co untries and investor companies alike. Background explaining the basis for this
 suggestion is co ntained in the following excerpt from Chapter 4 of "International Taxation and
 the Extractive tndustries '," where Jack Calder writes:

         "Oil is generally valued for tax and royalty purposes either on the basis of sales prices
         subject to a specific transfer pricing rule or on the basis of general norm or reference
         pricing. The latter is less common but is adopted by some major producers such as
         Norway, Angola, and Nigeria. For oil, arm's length sales from the same reservoir can
         reasonably be regarded as providing a CUP for the purpose of valuing non-arm's length
         transactions, since the quality is generally fairly co nsistent, at least over the short to
         medium term. Oil valuation rules are generally based on this assumption. They
         commonly allow for use of monthly or quarterly average prices to increase the pool of
         CUP.

          Since there may be insufficient arm's length sales from the reservoir to provide a
        reasonable range of CUP in the period, some countries require use of benchmark prices.
        These may be used on their own or in conjunction with actual arm's length sales of the
        crude to be valued, and combinations of different benchmarks may be used. There are
        differences in the quality of different crudes-light or intermediate crudes contain a
        higher proportion of the lighter fractions, such as gasoline, most in demand, and sweet
        (low-sulfur) crudes can be refined more cheaply than sour crudes-but crude from one
        reservoir is often physically comparable in quality with crudes from other locations and
        priced similarly in commercial transactions. FOB prices for a range of widely traded
        crudes are quoted by price-reporting agencies such as Platts, Argos or ICIS, providing the
        data required for benchmark or reference pricing. Generally, once a similar-quality
        benchmark crude has been identified, standard formulae can be applied to adjust its
        price to reflect measured differences in its physical quality. It may also be necessary to
        make an adjustment for transport cost differences, in which case, as discussed earlier,
        standard international freight charges could be used. Benchmark pricing is consistent
        with commercial practice, since sales between independent parties are often priced on
        the basis of a benchmark crude with a premium or discount. If arm's length sales of
        local crude are consistently priced this way, it may be possible just to use the standard
        market premium or discount rather than calculate comparability adjustments
        independently."

  We note that additional work in this area is envisioned and is mentioned in several places in the
  document. We support that work. We would point out that the practice of utilizing benchmark
  prices can be viewed simply as a part of developing a CUP under "traditional" transfer pricing
  methodologies ["Benchmark pricing is consistent with commercial practice ... "], and does not
  rely on further development of a "sixth-method" approach (in fact its utilization precedes the
· evolution of that "method.")

Comment 3: As noted in the paragraphs quoted above, reference is made to price-reporting
agencies such as Platts, Argos, and ICIS. We would suggest adding these to the listing of
databases referred to in Appendix 3.




Comment 4: In addressing costs charged into extraction companies and projects, it should be
noted that the oil and gas industry typically conducts such operations via joint ventures, with
one of the partners functioning as the operator. Costs charged by the operator to the venture
are, by long standing convention in the oil and gas industry, billed at "cost." The presence of
the other co-venturers and their audit rights ensures that the operator abides by this cost
approach, which will undoubtedly be reflected in the operating agreement. Again-in looking
for ways to eliminate transfer pricing disputes and analyses, this unique feature of the oil and
gas industry should be fully taken advantage of when assessing transfer pricing risks.




Comment 5: The above comments illustrate that in many cases oil and gas activities and
operations have unique characteristics which can be taken advantage of and can reduce risks
associated with transfer pricing issues. We would recommend that these points be emphasized
and explained. Again quoting from Jack Calder's chapter, "Transfer pricing of different
extractive industry products involves common, broad issues, but there are significant
differences of detail among oil, gas and minerals"."




Additional General Comments: We appreciate the chance to offer these comments and look
forward to continuing opportunities to comment upon revisions to this toolkit and to the
additional work identified in Part IV.

                                  Comments on Draft Toolkit for transfer pricing analysis


           The following are the comments of the Accounting & Tax Committee of the Japan Foreign Trade
           Council, Inc. (JFTC) in response to the invitation to public comments by the Platform for
          . Collaboration on Tax regarding the "A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables
           Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses" released on January 24th, 2017.


           The JFTC is a trade-industry association with Japanese trading companies and trading organizations
           as its core members. One of the main activities of JFTC's Accounting & Tax Committee is to submit
           specific policy proposals and requests concerning tax matters. Member companies of the JFTC
           Accounting & Tax Committee are listed at the end of this document.


           General Comments


                 We find the draft toolkit ("Toolkit") to be a concise and practical summation of the existing
                 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and duly acknowledge its effort to propose alternative
                 approaches (notably geographical/country risk adjustments) that may prove to be viable means
                 to alternate the established methods in the absence of reliable information.


                 On the other hand, although the Toolkit demands "careful consideration" to be given as to
                 whether such approaches should be used, as these approaches lack reliable empirical evidences,
                 we (as taxpayers) fear that there could be quite a significant gap between the tax
                 administrations and taxpayers and even between different tax administrations, upon interpreting
                what is meant by "careful consideration." It would be greatly beneficial to all parties involved,
                 if the Toolkit specified that these novel approaches "should not be applied in principle" until
                there has been a joint effort by an international body (e.g. OECD, UN) to deliver practical
                guidelines backed by reliable empirical evidences and broad consensus among the participating
                countries, so that uniform assessment practices and prevention of double taxations can be
                ensured.


           •    We would also like to note that there are cases that transfer pricing assessments are easily made

              in emerging countries where the number of comparable compan ies is limited and the risk and
              function analysis of taxpayers and related parties and the analysis of the appropriate transfer
              pricing method are not sufficiently carri ed out. The toolkit should emphasize that transfer
              pricing assessment should not be easily made without adequate and appropriate an alysis.


              Additionally, while the case studies provide some inform ative step-by-step depictions of
              transfer pricing audit, where the taxpayers have failed to arri ve at the most appropriate transfer
              pricing an alysis of their circum stan ces, it would also be highly resourceful to introduce some
              examples where the tax administration had made inappropriate judgm ents ( e.g. reckless
              selection ofTPM (especially CUP , PS) or comparability) as well.


         Specific Comments


              Part II. 4. Making optical use of available data (Page 31-Page 34)
              In this section, approach to obtain information from customs in addition to tax returns filed by
              taxpayers is introduced, however, we are highly concerned about securing taxpayers'
              confidentiality and the possibility of using secret comparables under the situation where taxpayers
              have limited access to information owned and used by tax authorities. Therefore, in order to
              enable transfer pricing enforcement to be effective and transparent, we request that tax authorities
              should avoid using secret comparables and basically proceed with their assessment in accordance
              with transfer pricing analysis made by taxpayers.


              Part II. 6.2 Statistical approaches (page 47)
              In "Box 18.Sugar Producer," the Toolkit introduces a simple illustration where the actual PLI of
              the tested party was below the interquartile range and subsequently adjusted to the median point
              of the range, which we agree is a method commonly used by majority of tax administrations
              around the globe.


              We believe the Toolkit could benefit more by taking note of the instances where some tax
              administrations (namely China (*)) deviates from the above-mentioned norm and applies
              reckless adjustments to the median point even when the PLI falls within the interquartile range
              (lower half). It would be useful for the report to emphasize the rationale behind using the
              interquartile range, which is to improve the reliability of the analysis by eliminating the lowest
              and the highest 25% of the comparables set, as opposed to blindly assuming that only the
              median point or above should be considered ALP.


              (*) Article 41 of the Special Tax Adjustment Measures (2009)
               "When the tax authorities analyze and evaluate the enterprise's profitability by using the
              quartile method, if the enterprise's profit level is below the median of the range of profitability

              established by comparable enterprises, m principle the tested enterprise's profit should be
              adjusted up to a level not lower than the median of the range established by the comparable
              enterprises."


              Part III. 2. Approaches to increase the availability of primary comparables data (Page
              52-Page53)
              In this section, approaches to increase the availability of primary comparables data are introduced.
              However, we are concerned that it could result in requiring taxpayers' compliance more than now.
              We request the toolkit should mention that it is necessary to consider taxpayers' burden of
              compliance costs when considering the enforcement of transfer pricing.


         •    Part III. 4.1 Safe Harbors for TP (Page 54 - Page 60)
              Safe Harbors may improve predictability and reduce compliance costs for taxpayers as well as tax
              collection costs for tax authorities if properly designed and exercised.


              While an "opt-out" regime may contribute to reducing administrative costs for tax administrations,
              the burden of proof borne by taxpayers should be carefully taken into account when designing a
              safe harbor.


              For instance, where a safe harbor requires a relatively high profit level, the taxpayer may be
              inclined to opt out of it. It is observed, however, that in certain countries, the tax administrations
              impose excessive burden of proof on the taxpayers and sometimes even on the overseas
              associated enterprises of those taxpayers. It would be beneficial for the Toolkit to note that such
              kind of practices would not only deviate from the original purpose of achieving simplification,
              but also may lead to double taxation for certain taxpayers without sufficient administrative
              capacity to cope with the burden of proof.


              In addition, it should be emphasized that the price or profit level of safe harbor rule needs to be
              set at a reasonable level which will be treated as appropriate for transfer pricing purpose even in
              the counterparty countries. If it is not the case, it should be noted that taxpayers are exposed to
              double taxation risk, and tax authorities will also increase the enforcement cost thereafter, so that
              the main purposes of the safe harbor rule cannot be achieved.


         •    Part III. 5. Transactional Profit Split (PS) Method (Page60 - Page 61)
              An approach where Profit Split ratio is not calculated using external data is introduced, but
              without finalizing the revised OECD Transfer pricing Guidelines which are still under discussion
              at OECD, the descriptions may lead to tax authorities' misuse of PS method. Therefore, in order
              to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, we request to delete the descriptions or add more detailed
              notice for the application of PS method if it is difficult.

              Part Ill. 8. An ti-avoidance and other tax base protection measures (Page 63 - Page 64)
              While it can be useful to introduce anti-avoidance measures other than transfer pricing in the
              Toolkit, in the absence of detailed guidance on how to apply such measures, tax administrations
              may misinterpret them as a quick alternative that can be exploited whenever they find difficulties
              in applying transfer pricing. We suggest for this part to be removed from the Toolkit all together
              or at least, appropriate remarks/examples regarding the challenges in applying each measure be
              added.


              Case I (Page 71)
              Case Study 1 provides some useful insights on re-visiting both contractual and circumstantial
              evidences of a controlled transaction, and arrives at the conclusion that B Co should be
              re-characterized as a service provider (commissionaire) in order to better reflect the economic
              substance presented by the case. The Toolkit suggests that the TNMM with (full) costs is the
              appropriate PLI in this case while the Toolkit suggests in Part II, 2.4.1, when remunerating tested
              party that is a service provider, one should bear in mind that its PLI should reflect "the strong
              correlation between the profitability... and its costs." As such, B Co, which in essence is deemed a
              limited risk intermediary with no recognizable marketing intangibles, should be compensated
              using Berry Ratio (Footnote 32). It would be beneficial if the Toolkit could include this point to
              the conclusion (and as a precaution, also mention that selecting Full Cost Plus is a commonly
              made mistake, where there is no correlation between COGS and the service provider's
              profitability as can be observed in this case).

To:          Whom It May Concern

From:        David R. Jarczyk, ktMINE, CEO

Subject: Comments Regarding: A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables
             Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses



There is a need to educate the transfer pricing community on the data available in the public
domain prior to furthering discussions regarding adjustments, interpretations, and determining
the arm's length nature of tested transactions. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide
information on the availability of market data:

1) for independent transactions involving intangibles, and

2) for other independent transactions analyzed for transfer pricing purposes.



The spirit of comparability analyses is properly discussed in the following paragraph from the
discussion draft:

          "Comparability analyses are an important element in the implementation of the arm's
          length principle, requiring a comparison of the conditions in transactions between
          associated parties ("controlled transactions") with the conditions in comparable
          transactions between independent parties ("comparable uncontrolled transactions" or
          "comparables"). It is important to emphasise that comparability analyses are not always
          primarily focused on the actual price of the transaction (emphasis is mine). In many
          instances, transfer pricing rules operate to consider whether a transaction has occurred
          at all, or has occurred in a way that is substantively different from that which is
          described in contracts or documentation; in ways that are substantively different from
          those which would occur at arm's length; or are not commercially rational (emphasis is
          mine)."1

However, the discussion draft quickly turns to the incorrect assessment that there is a lack of
reliable, usable information. Below I provide information on the availability of market data for
transfer pricing purposes.



Data Available for Transactions Involving Intangibles

While it may be true that information on the arm's length nature and pricing of intangibles
transactions are difficult to find for certain developing countries, many practitioners seem to
misunderstand the very structure of license agreements. In fact, most license agreements are
made to cover all geographies (i.e., worldwide territory rights) or regional geographies (i.e.
regional territory rights, such as Africa, South America, and European Union).



In fact, based on ktMINE's research, over 75% of publicly available license agreements include
territories for regions outside the United States.



Why is this the case? When independent parties get together to make a deal, their lawyers' job
is to protect corporate interests. An owner of intangibles (i.e., Licensor) wants to ensure the
intangible rights are exploited in a specific region which will not infringe upon or compete with
its other business interests. A party looking to exploit intangibles (i.e., Licensee) wants to ·
ensure it receives a clear understanding of the territory in which the intangible rights are
permitted to be exploited and maximize its geographical reach in the hopes of maximizing
profit. As such, we find that many independent market transactions allow for worldwide or
broad regional rights. The contract terms surrounding pricing structure, functions, risks, and
exploitation of intangibles factor into the negotiation of royalty rates, flat payments, milestone
payments, etc.

Data Available for Other Transactions Analyzed for Transfer Pricing Purposes

It must be noted that independent contracts exist for a variety of transactions beyond those
involving intangibles. These contracts provide a detailed representation of the functions
performed, risks assumed, and assets employed by both parties. Furthermore, they provide
specific definitions regarding pricing structure and the payments themselves. Many of these
contracts are made to cover all geographies (i.e., worldwide territory rights) or regional
geographies (i.e. regional territory rights, such as Africa, South America, and the European
Union).

Common Myths vs. Facts

MYTH: Global Market Information is Not Available

FACT: Based on ktMINE's research, over 75% of publicly available license agreements include
territories for regions outside the United States.



MYTH: Information is only available for U.S. companies

FACT: Based on ktMINE's research, most companies that are party to publicly disclosed
contracts are not U.S. companies.

Suggested Edits to Appendix Regarding ktMINE

Please make the following edits to the appendix of the discussion draft when discussing
ktMINE's content coverage:



ktMINE provides transfer pricing users with 3 distinct data sets:

   •   Royalty Rates - With over 60,000 disclosed rates, support intercompany royalty rates
       and document findings with evidence found in independent party agreements.
   •   Agreements - Support intercompany transactions by referencing how independent
       parties have structured similar transactions and allocated risks and functions.
   •   Intangibles Portfolios & Intangibles lntercompany Movement - Gain access to a
       company's intangibles and licensing portfolio to assist in developing a value chain
       analysis and identifying legal intangibles ownership (which is the starting point for
       determining economic ownership).

E CONCLUDING REMARKS
This section sets out concluding remarks.

                                                 ***
A GENERAL
The report is well written and the Toolkit appears to be useful for developing countries, both
revenue authorities as well as taxpayers. Particularly useful are the examples and case studies
provided as well as the supporting information set out in the appendices.
However, while it is understood that the Toolkit is designed to merely provide different options on a
high level for revenue authorities and taxpayers regarding how to address the lack of (suitable) local
or regional comparables, it is submitted that in order for the suggested approaches to be effective,
specific and detailed recommendations should be made regarding which approach should be
followed in what case, e.g., if no local comparables are available, regional comparables should be
used. If regional comparables are not available, foreign comparables from other markets should be
used. Thereafter, recommendations in respect of adjustments, safe harbours etc could be applied.
The Toolkit was designed, in collaboration by the IMF, the OECD, the World Bank and the UN, to
assist developing countries applying local transfer pricing rules following the OECD Transfer
Pricing Guidelines or the UN Transfer Pricing Manual, to overcome or at least mitigate problems
arising from the lack of suitable local comparables. Therefore, and to avoid any misconception, it
should be clarified that when applying the Toolkit, revenue authorities must also continue to follow
the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the UN Transfer Pricing Manual.
B COMMENTS IN RESPECT OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
We set out below comments in respect of the specific questions to the Toolkit as raised by the PCT:
1. Does this toolkit effectively help address the challenges identified by developing
   countries in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer pricing analysis as part of
   a tax audit?
General
KPMG is of the view that the toolkit seems comprehensive and helpful for addressing challenges
faced by developing countries relating to the limitation or lack of comparable data for conducting
benchmarking database searches. The approaches set out give a broad range of options to revenue
authorities to choose from when checking benchmarking searches provided by taxpayers to support
cross-border controlled transactions entered into.




                                                 112
                                                           Comments to The Platform for Collaboration on Tax
                                                                                          February 20, 2017




However, a major concern is that many revenue authorities in developing countries are still in the
process of building transfer pricing capacity, and the majority of approaches set out in the toolkit
requires significant theoretical and practical experience on the side of the authorities.
In addition, in order to ensure that taxpayers are able to comply with any specific local requirements
and/or approaches to be followed where there is a lack of suitable comparables in respect of a
specific developing country, it should be made clear that the local revenue authority should publish
clear, consistent guidance regarding the acceptable approach or approaches available to taxpayers.
Thus, while the Toolkit is very useful, it may not achieve the desired effect where revenue
authorities do not have the manpower and/or skill to implement it. Further the Toolkit should make
clear that, to the extent that local authorities adopt specific approaches to identifying suitable
comparables, they must provide certain and clear guidance to taxpayers to facilitate compliance and
minimize controversy.
Financial transactions
The toolkit does not specifically address approaches for benchmarking financial transactions such
as loans and credit guarantees.
In practice, multinational groups often finance part of their operations in developing countries via
intra-group financing arrangements. This could be between a developed country and a developing
country, or between group companies in two different developing countries.
In the absence of safe harbour rules, some countries require that the interest rate applied in respect
of a loan should be arm's length, other countries require that both the interest rate in respect of a
loan, as well as the amount borrowed from a related party must be arm's length.
Currently, developing countries often rely on comparables from similar geographical markets based
on information from databases that can only provide limited financial data.
Additionally, developing countries have often foreign exchange control rules in place, which impact
the free outflow of capital. This may result in differences between on-shore and off-shore lending
rates and guidance regarding the treatment of such differences would be helpful.
KPMG recommends that more detailed guidance in respect of financial transactions should be
included in the Toolkit.
2. How can better use of administrative information, in a way that maintains taxpayer
   confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country and regional level?
KPMG is very concerned that sharing of taxpayer information between tax authorities for purposes
other than a tax audit of the particular taxpayer or its related group will lead to loss of
confidentiality.




                                                  113

                                                                                          February 20, 20 I 7




In addition, as noted in the Toolkit, any use of such secret information by tax authorities will lead to
unfair tax audits as taxpayers are challenged with information that they cannot analyze or even
understand.
KPMG specifically recommends clarification that "use of administrative information" for
development of secret comparable databases by tax authorities would not be appropriate as it would
lead to the chaotic application and misapplication of the arm's length principal. Further comments
on secret comparables are included below in Part II of our Additional Comments.
3. How could the reliability ofpotential comparables from other geographic markets be
   tested?
It may be challenging to test the reliability of comparables from other geographic markets
depending on the location of the tested party and the type of transaction under review. However,
one approach would be to compare available data from local companies to that from candidate
foreign geographic markets. While the number of local companies would be low (leading to the
problem at hand) such comparison could pool that data and perform and economic / statistical
analyses to determine the most appropriate similar geographies. Given the need to have access to
global databases, assistance with this type of testing could be provided by the private sector as part
of a joint revenue authority/taxpayer initiative.
It is recommended that revenue authorities should inform taxpayers which databases they regard as
acceptable and if specific search filters should be applied.
4. Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a lack of
   comparables not addressed in the discussion draft?
Instead of focusing on local or regional comparables, a different but useful approach could be to
focus on regional comparable from a region where the economic environment is comparable to the
country/region where the tested party is based. For example, Eastern European comparables could
be used to support a tested party in South Africa.
5.   What other adjustments for geographic market dif ferences could be made, and in
     what circumstances? How could the reliability of such adjustments be empirically
     tested?
In KPMG's experience, making reliable adjustments is very specific to the particular circumstances
of the analysis. KPMG does not have broad applicable suggestions in this regard.

                                                                                        February 20, 2017




6. Do the mineral pricing case studies accurately reflect market trading terms? Are
   there other adjustments that would be routinely made when these mineral products
   are sold?
It is KPMG's view that the mineral pricing case studies generally reflect market trading terms.
More detailed comments relating to the mineral products studies are set out in section D below.
C ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
Below, we set out comments and suggestions relating to Parts I to IV of the Toolkit as well as the
case studies and appendices.
Part I: Introduction
Formulary apportionment
Unitary Taxation/Formulary apportionment approach is briefly discussed on page 6. Although it is
stated that formulary apportionment approaches are specifically excluded from the discussion in the
Toolkit because "they are unlikely to be implemented at global level in the foreseeable future", the
statement may be confusing in that this approach is still mentioned and the footnote mentions the
re-launch of the CCCTB initiative in Europe. As the Unitary Taxation/Formulary apportionment
approach continues to surface as an alternative method to applying the arm's length principle, the
reference in the Toolkit may be confusing and send the wrong message. KPMG therefore suggests
that the reference to formulary apportionment should be removed as the purpose of the Toolkit is to
provide alternative options where suitable local comparable data is not available, i.e. specifically
where the arm's length principle is followed.
Part II: Issues arising when conducting a comparability analysis
This part of the Toolkit provides a high level overview of how to perform a comparability analysis,
considerations regarding comparability data, the availability data, adjustments and the interpretation
of data collected and the determination of the arm's length remuneration. Below, specific comments
and suggestions are set out:
Other sources of information: secret comparables
The use of secret comparables is addressed on pages 31 and 32. It is correctly pointed out that both
the OECD and the UN state that secret comparables should not be used unless requisite information
can be disclosed to the taxpayer. In KPMG's experience, the requisite information is not disclosed
to the taxpayer as this would almost always breach local confidentiality rules. As a result, KPMG
recommends that the Toolkit make it clear that secret comparables are not a fair or reasonable
approach to benchmarking arm's length pricing or arm's length results. See KPMG's comments on
the OECD Paper on Transfer Pricing Comparability Data and Developing Countries dated April, 11
2014. KPMG also notes that the use of secret comparables makes resolving double tax cases more
difficult under Mutual Agreement Procedures.

                                                        Comments to The Platf
                                                                                      February 20, 2017




Explicitly acknowledging this issue in the Toolkit would help developing countries understand why
secret comparables are not endorsed by the OECD and the UN. KPMG further recommends that the
Toolkit state that revenue authorities should first consider the benchmarking analysis provided by
the taxpayer before considering any non-public data.
China is the only country quoted as an example in the Toolkit of a jurisdiction where the use of
secret comparables is explicitly sanctioned by the transfer pricing legislation, and the Toolkit
further points out that "most, but not all, countries either specifically prohibit the use of secret
comparables or refrain from using them in practice." Reference is made to SA T's Circular 2, which
includes a specific provision empowering tax authorities to use non-public information to analyse
and evaluate the compliance with the arm's length principle in the context ofan investigation.1
In practice, however, KPMG's member firm in China has observed a number of audit cases where
tax authorities initially pointed to the existence of secret comparables but, after careful
consideration of taxpayer's arguments, then decided to rely solely on the publicly available data
provided by the taxpayer. Thus, this supports the view that secret comparables cannot be used
reliably or fairly in practice.
Accordingly, KPMG is of the view that the Toolkit should make it clear that secret comparables
should not be used by revenue authorities even where there are reliability concerns with publicly
available comparable data. Rather, alternative approaches or methods under the OECD Guidelines
should be explored.
Comparability adjustments
While the guidance provided in respect of comparability adjustments (pages 34 to 45) is useful, the
different options of adjustments and the methodologies available for making these adjustments may
lead to uncertainty for taxpayers and revenue authorities alike. This is specifically the case where
broad experience and skills are limited within the relevant revenue authority. Also, the making of
adjustments often requires judgment, which may lead to subjective results. It is therefore KPMG's
view that the Toolkit should clarify that the making of comparability adjustments requires clear
guidance and consistent application. It would also be important for revenue authorities to publish
local guidelines to set out what approach must be followed by taxpayers and revenue authorities to
avoid uncertainty.

Part Ill: Approaches to applying internationally accepted principles in the absence of
comparables
Negotiated settlements
On pages 51 and 52 of the Toolkit it states that taxpayers and tax authorities need to be realistic
with respect to the use of comparables. KPMG agrees that comparability is not an exact science
and that all parties must reasonably utilize the available data.
KPMG strongly agrees with the Toolkit that the available data should inform any dispute
settlements. To do otherwise would be an abandonment of the arm's length standard and lead to
arbitrary tax results.
Testing the benefits received
On page 53 of the Toolkit, reference is made to a benefits test for services and intangibles. In
KPMG's experience this area is one of the most contentious for multinationals operating in
developing countries. In particular, it is KPMG's experience that revenue authorities demand
extremely high levels of documentation and other types of proof in support of the benefit received
by the local taxpayer for services rendered by a related party. KPMG suggests that the effort
involved as part of these discussions is disproportionate to the level of risk of non-arm's length
pricing. Consistent with the OECD Final Report on BEPS Actions 8-1 O's discussion of low value
added services, KPMG recommends that the low value added services listed in paragraph 7.49 of
the OECD Final Report be presumed to provide a benefit to the local taxpayer. The taxpayer and
the revenue authority can then agree on the appropriate arm's length charge. This presumption of
benefit is important because, in KPMG's experience, too often the revenue authorities refuse to
recognize any benefit and determine that the arm's length charge is nil. In KPMG's view, these
types of services are common and necessary for multinational groups to operate. The arm's length
charge is not nil and guidance on the benefit provided would be very helpful.
In addition, while the concept of a "benefit requirement" is not new in respect of services
transactions, this may lead to confusion when considering the arm's length nature of a royalty
transaction. In practice it is often difficult to determine the benefits in terms of a related party cross-
border services transaction, and it can be even more difficult where the use of intangible property is
concerned.
KPMG believes that the concept of a "benefits test" for intangibles transactions to confirm arm's
length nature of any transaction is not useful as it complicates and does not help in mitigating the
issue of lacking comparables in developing countries. KPMG recommends focusing on whether the
local taxpayer is making use of the intangible. This determination is generally simpler to make.

                                                                                         February 20, 2017




Safe harbours
The Toolkit, on page 54, sets out the benefits of using safe harbor rules and it also sets out certain
shortcomings and issues. KPMG supports the view that safe harbor rules may constitute a simple
method to address the lack of suitable local comparables, but safe harbours can create a deviation
from the arm's length principle unless there is regular review and update of the safe harbor,
The process of deriving the safe harbour rate should be transparent.
Transactional profit split method
It is stated on page 61 of the Toolkit that "valuable contributions most frequently derive from the
utilisation of valuable scarce contributions, including those from intangibles and from the
assumption (including the control and management) of the key business risks." The term "valuable
scarce contributions" appears to be new and not generally known. KPMG believes that it would be
useful to clarify the meaning, e.g. by giving an example, to avoid confusion.
Royalty caps and other anti-avoidance measures
Page 63 of the Toolkit discusses royalty caps, i.e. a top limitation of the royalty deductions that may
be claimed by the licensee. KPMG strongly believes that this approach directly contradicts the
arm's length standard and objects to its use as an anti-avoidance mechanism on the basis that it goes
beyond any of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative related recommendations.
The Toolkit states that some developing countries have exchange control restrictions in place which
may lead to a similar result as royalty caps. However, in KPMG's experience there have been cases
where exchange control authorities have allowed a higher royalty deduction in a developing country
on the basis of a transfer pricing study that supports a royalty rate higher that the standard rate
approved by the exchange authorities is appropriate.
The Toolkit is entirely unclear as to its view on the various anti-avoidance and tax base protection
measures set out on pages 63 and 64. In KPMG's view they do not offer a solution to the lack of
suitable comparables that a developing country may face and will typically distort the arm's length
standard in their application. KPMG recommends that the Toolkit unambiguously support the arm's
length standard and admonish countries not to adopt short cuts such as royalty caps.
Part IV: Summary, conclusions, and recommendations for further work
KPMG finds this section of the Toolkit useful and agrees with the recommendations for further
work to assist revenue authorities and taxpayers in developing countries from a transfer pricing
perspective.

                                                                                         February 20, 2017




Case studies
The case studies are useful. KPMG suggests that more case studies dealing with specific issues
experienced in developing countries should be included, e.g. management services provided to a
multinational group entity in a developing country, regional distributor/limited risk distributor.
Appendices
The information contained in the appendices supports the information in the main parts of the
Toolkit and appears to be very useful. Some specific comments relating to the appendices
information is set out below.
Appendix 1 (functional and risk analysis):
The questionnaire provided in this appendix is very detailed and seems to aim to address a wide
variety of scenarios. We suggest that it should be clarified that revenue authorities should gain an
understanding of the taxpayer's business from the transfer pricing documentation provided first
before embarking on a potentially lengthy exercise to gather the information as set out in this
functional and risk analysis.
D DISCUSSION DRAFT: ADDRESSING THE INFORMATION GAPS ON PRICES
OF MINERALS SOLD IN AN INTERMEDIATE FORM
KPMG's specific comments relating to "addressing the information gaps on prices of minerals sold
in an intermediate form" are set out below:
1. The case studies in the Toolkit provide detailed overviews of the typical processes for the
extraction and refining of four categories of minerals into intermediate and finished products. In
particular, the Toolkit focuses on the types of contracts entered into between industry players at
several common stages in the extraction and refining processes for each of the four minerals. The
Toolkit is a useful resource for both revenue authorities and taxpayers in terms of developing an
understanding of industry dynamics. This type of analysis and discussion demonstrates some of the
elements taxpayers should consider in their transfer pricing documentation. However, the
application of the examples presented in the Toolkit should be applied with the recognition that
MNEs may exhibit some differences to the examples and these differences can impact the overall
value chain and transfer pricing. As discussed in the points below, the Toolkit should be used with
caution as it does not provide a complete guide to application of the arm's length principle.

2. The Toolkit outlines the extraction and refining phases of the value chain. But, discussion of the
exploration, feasibility assessment, mine development, marketing, sales and logistics processes
would enhance the guidance contained in the Toolkit. These additional components of the value
chain may be important to the transfer pricing analysis of the various transactions that occur
throughout the value chain.




                                                  119
                                                           Comments to The Platform for Collaboration on Tax
                                                                                          February 20, 2017




3. The Toolkit focuses on application of the CUP method, including identifying sources of public
information where internal comparable uncontrolled transactions do not exist and contemplating
various adjustments for comparability differences. While it may be possible to reliably apply the
CUP method to price the sale of minerals, we recommend the Toolkit recognize there will be
circumstances where there will be insufficient data on comparable uncontrolled transactions for the
reliable application of a CUP or adjusted CUP method. The Toolkit should make it clear that
another transfer pricing method should be considered when comparability differences between the
controlled transaction and the uncontrolled transactions cannot be resolved.

4. Where the CUP method cannot be reliably applied, it may be more reliable to test the margins or
results of one of the transacting parties, such as a processing or selling/marketing entity against the
results for comparables that have a similar functional profile. We recommend the Toolkit include
guidance on how to apply these other transfer pricing methods.

E CONCLUDING REMARKS
KPMG welcomes this Toolkit as it is very useful, and commends the PCT for developing it. The
Toolkit will provide, once finalized, relief to revenue authorities and taxpayers operating in
developing countries alike.
Overall, KPMG notes that it would be good to include in the Toolkit a recommendation for
developing countries to put in place specific guidance for revenue authorities and taxpayers
regarding which approaches should be followed when facing a lack of suitable local and/or regional
comparables, and in which order they should be applied. It is important that this guidance ensures
clarity and consistency.
In addition, the Toolkit will only be successful to the extent that sufficient skilled transfer pricing
teams are placed at the revenue authorities in the relevant developing countries to enforce transfer
pricing. It is understood in this regard that various measures are currently in place to build skills at
various levels.

      Comments to the draft toolkit to address the lack of comparables on developing countries


      Gentlemen,

      On behalf of the Transfer Pricing Commi ssion of the Mexican Federation of Economists
      Colleges, herein you will find our comments on regards of the questions raised by the Draft
      Toolkit Designed to Help Developing Countries Address the Lack of Comparables for Transfer
      Pricing Analyses. We hope you can find them useful:


      1.         Does this toolkit effectively help address the challenges identified by developing
      countries in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer pricing analysis as part of a tax audit?
      Yes, the toolkit considers the main issues dealing with the lack of comparables in emerging
      countries.

     2.        How can better use of admini strative information, in a way that maintains taxpayer
     confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country and regional level? It is entirely up to the
     national authorities to establish provisions whereby local and regional financial and business
     information of the taxpayers can be accessed. But it is important to consider that in some
     countries, there are business information systems that gather information from companies at the
     domestic level, and that in some cases provide useful information for transfer pricing analysis,
     including the id of the issuer of such financial information (i.e. el Sistema de Informaci6n y
     Reporte Empresarial, SIREM de Colombia).

     3.         How could the reliability of potential comparables from other geographic markets be
     tested? Based on the Platform of Tax Collaboration and the OCDE Transfer Pricing Guidelines,
     we consider three important points that could support the analysis with reliable comparable data.
     It's important to mention that paragraphs 3.80 - 3.83 of the Transfer Pricing Guidelines
     mention the extent of the burden and costs. that should be borne by a taxpayer to identify
     possible comparables and obtain detailed information. There is no requirement for an exhaustive
     search of all possible relevant sources of information. Pragmatic solutions may be appropriate to
     find a reasonable response to each transfer pricing case.

     With this being mentioned, we consider that one way to assure reliability in the comparable set
     to be selected could be done with a previous comparison of countries. This would be through an
     assessment of default rating scores, prepared by independent and international institution such as
     Moody's or Standard and Poors, by choosing the countries with similar rates, thus excluding
     economies with better or worse score. This would help to select comparable companies from
     countries with similar risks.




                                                                                                       1/5

      The second consideration that may help would be to analyze how the economies react to
      external economic events, i.e. if the United States market grows, then search for countries which
      would have similar outcomes after such event. A search for similar effects in different countries
      would provide a more comparable data in specific sectors under similar circumstances.

      The last point would be to analyze the economic indicators infrastructure investment,
      communication and inflation with indexes such as: Investment in Energy, Investment in
      Telecoms and Investment in Transport issued by the World Bank. After gathering the indexes of
      the country in which the tested party operates, then make a comparison with data from all over
      the world to find the most comparable countries.

      An important point to analyze is how the economic sector or industry has developed within the
      countries of residence of comparable companies or transactions by analyzing growth rates,
      employment or investment levels, for example; Additional to assure if there is or not any
      governmental policy favoring these sectors, since significant differences in such indicators could
      generate different levels of profits or prices that are not necessarily linked to the functions, assets
      and risks of these comparables.

      4.        Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a lack of
      comparables not addressed in the discussion draft? A potential solution to address the lack of
      comparable transactions that were not explored in the discussion draft has to do with the
      selection of the tested party. For example, in the Latin American case, intercompany transactions
      often involve related parties from countries where much more information is available. (United
      States, Germany, France, Netherlands, Japan, Spain). As a result, it might be a real option to
      choose the residents of those jurisdictions as entity under analysis. Of course, this raises
      important challenges for the correct implementation of the transfer pricing method at least in
      terms of the quality of the information provided by these countries, as well as the possible
      position of the counterparty's tax authorities on regards of the access to the information of the
      tested party. Additionally there is the possibility that the chosen tested party wouldn't be the
      simpler one within the transaction as emphasized in the OECD Guidelines (A.3.3.). However,
      and considering the abovementioned circumstances, this might be an acceptable approach
      considering the possibility of affecting the results of the method due to lack of functional or
      economic comparability. \   Ve suggest exploring the mechanisms under which this approach can
      be used, as well as the considerations that should be made to alleviate any questions from the tax
      authorities involved.

      5.        What other adjustments for geographic market differences could be made, and in what
      circumstances? How could the reliability of such adjustments be empirically tested? There are
      numerous economic circumstances that could affect comparability of entities located in different
      countries. The toolkit focuses in certain country risk adjustments that eliminate some of these
      differences, such as inflation rates, interest rates, access to credit market, etc. Other differences,
      such as labor costs may be better addressed by location savings adjustments, which have also
      been generally discussed .by transfer pricing practitioners and members of the Platform for
      Collaboration in Tax. Finally, differences in economic circumstances associated to the specific
      industry or product such as level of competition, availability of substitute goods or services, local
      regulations, etc., could be eliminated by specific adjustments on a case by case basis.




                                                                                                         2/5

Mexican Federation of Economists Colleges
Transfer Pricing Commission




      In fact, in our view, it is important to emphasis that geographic market adjustments should not
      be generally applied by the mere fact that comparable entities are located in a different country.
      The appropriateness of the adjustment should be assessed on a case by case basis, after careful
      analyzes of the market and competitive conditions in both countries; and of the accuracy of the
      adjustment to improve comparability.

      The case by case analysis, becomes even more important for developing countries that tend to
      rely on comparables located in countries perceived as low risk, because some country risk
      adjustments only move the arm's length range up. While we appreciate that a rational investor
      would expect a higher return to invest. in a riskier country, one could also argue that in a riskier
      country there are not only higher probabilities to earn more but also to lose more, and therefore
      an appropriate country risk adjustment should widen the range.

      An adjustment that could be considered is about the differences m quantiues. One of the
      challenges faced by specialists in applying Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (CUP) is the
      scarcity of domestic information that can be used for comparability analysis, especially in
      countries where public information is very limited.

      For example, analyzing an inventory purchase controlled transaction, it may be the case to have
      information about uncontrolled transactions of identical goods, however, differ in amounts
      purchased in relation to the controlled transaction.

      In an open market, differences in the quantity of a good exchanged can generate differences in
      the agreed prices, that is, a greater quantity of a good, the offerer would be willing to reduce the
      price of that. This is based on the laws of supply and demand, which state that the greater the
      quantity of a good or service offered the price tends to decrease and vice versa.

      The paragraph 1.33 of the Transfer Price Guidelines mention that to be comparable means that
      none of the differences (if any) between the situations being compared could materially affect the
      condition being examined in the methodology (e.g. price or margin), or that reasonably accurate
      adjustments can be made to eliminate the effect of any such differences.

      One way to make a reasonable adjustment in which quantities differences can be eliminated is
      through elasticities, elasticity is defined as the percentage variation of a variable X as a
      consequence of the variation of a variable Y, in our case, would be defined as the change in the
      price of a good as a consequence of the variation of the purchased quantities of that. The above
      can be calculated with the following formula:



                                                 Px1 - Px2
                                              Ep=-----
                                                         Px2




      Definitions:


                                                                                                      3/5

      Eu   = Elasticity per unit.
      Ep     = Elasticity per price
      u1   =   Lrut comparable 1.

      u2   = Unit comparable 2.
      Px1      = Unit price comparable 1.
      Px 2     =   unit price comparable 2.




      Once obtained the value of the variation in the prices as a consequence of the variations in the
      demanded units, we proceed to obtain the price that independent parties would have agreed
      under similar circumstances and similar amounts to those that were agreed in the controlled
      operation making possible the implementation of the CUP


      6.          Do the mineral pricing case studies accurately reflect market trading terms? Are there
      other adjustments that would be routinely made when these mineral products are sold? In
      general, a problematic that arise when a transfer pricing analysis is performed for mining
      companies, is the comparable information derived from the operation structures that some
      mines follow in development economies. For example when a search of comparable companies
      is performed, in general such companies operate integrally, this is, the extraction of the minerals,
      the chemical process to these minerals, obtaining licenses and the sale of minerals, among other
      activities. Mining companies in development economies have different structures for its
      operation, for instance, there are different companies of the group involve in the process, one
      company has licenses, other company has the assets require for the extraction of minerals or the
      chemical process, other company performed the chemical process, and in some cases, other
      company, perform the final sales.

      Derived from the abovementioned, search of comparable companies that performed same
      activities for the companies that are involve in the mine process could be a problem.

      Notwithstanding chat the transfer pricing analyses for mining companies consider comparable
      companies in the same industry, not always they will reflect the market conditions, derived from
      the above-mentioned.

     Regarding the adjustments that could be performed, there is a specific adjustment for the
     mineral price when it is extracted and sells for the company that performs the chemical process.
     In general, this adjustment consider the commodity price (market information), and then it is
     subtracted all the costs incurred in the chemical process and different concepts regarding the
     concentration of mineral.

     A database that includes this kind of adjustments for the principal minerals (gold, silver, copper,
     etc.) could he helpful for transfer pricing analyses.

                                                                                                      4/5

Subject: Comment on Draft Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data


        I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft of the Toolkit. I am a researcher and
practitioner in the international transfer pricing field, and I offer this comment in my personal
capacity.

        The draft Toolkit, I believe, has many potentially useful suggestions of ways by which .
developing-country tax administrations might achieve more useful results from the application of
transfer pricing methods, particularly the transactional net margin method (TNMM), which is
used frequently by taxpayers and tax administrations in countries of all levels of economic
development. I believe, however, that the Toolkit should give greater, and explicit, attention to a
problem that in my experience has greatly impaired the reliability of TNMM as it usually is
applied in practice: namely, the difficulties introduced when taxpayers or tax administrations
apply statistical methods under TNMM, including but not limited to the "interquartile range," to
very small sample sizes of comparables. 1

         In my experience, private and government practitioners often apply statistical analysis to
sample sizes in the range of 6 to 9.2 These sample sizes are much smaller than can permit useful
statistical inference. One consequence of this problem is that the medians of the ranges that are
computed cannot be seen as reliable indicators of the level of income that would be expected of a
taxpayer acting at arm's length: there are simply insufficient data points to yield a reliable
measure of central tendency like a median.

        Far more important in practice, especially in developing countries, is the tendency of very
small sample sizes to generate very wide purported arm's-length ranges. In my experience, it is
not unusual to see reports that present arm's-length ranges using, say, the net operating margin as
the profit level indicator, that range from near-zero or even negative margins at the low end, to
margins in the double digits at the high end. Arm's-length ranges of this width offer no useful
guidance to either taxpayers or tax administrators. Often, these ranges can tum the tax
examination process into one of wide-ranging negotiation between taxpayers and governments,
with no objective reference points. Inevitably, especially in countries that feel strongly beholden
to pressures of tax competition, the allowable profit level for the taxpayer is agreed at a very low
level.

  For prior discussion of this topic see Michael C. Durst and Robert E. Culbertson, "Clearing Away the Sand:
Retrospective Methods and Prospective Documentation in Transfer Pricing Today," 57 Tax Law Review 37, I 08-
 114 (2003).
2 The draft toolkit contains an example, in Box 18 on page 47, in which a sample size of 32 is posited. This appears

to be a reasonable number of observations for use in statistical inference. In actual practice, however, in my
experience, sample sizes are much lower than that posited in the example.




                                                         127
                                                                                                       2



       The Toolkit's utility in enabling developing countries to deal more effectively with base
erosion will be enhanced by a thorough analysis of problems related to sample size, especially
under TNMM. Steps the developers of the Toolkit might take include:

       (i)     Providing an explanation, incorporating authoritative expertise in statistical
               theory, of the effects of sample size on the reliability of arm's-length ranges under
               TNMM.

      · (ii)   Obtaining unbiased samples of transfer pricing documentation in the examination
               files of different countries, in order to gather empirical indications of sample sizes
               used, and the width of computed arm's-length ranges, in actual practice. (This
               information would be extremely valuable in developing the Toolkit, although
               considerations related to taxpayer confidentiality may limit its availability.)

       (iii)   Asking practitioners to provide unbiased samples of documentation that they have
               provided in practice with, of course, the identification of taxpayers deleted.
               (Again, information of this kind would be extremely valuable, but various
               concerns of practitioners may limit its availability.)

       (iv)    Performing simulated TNMM analyses under assumed but realistic fact patterns,
               and using the commercial databases typically used in practice, employing a range
               of different sample sizes. On the basis of these analyses, the Toolkit could offer
               tax administrations informed and detailed observations about the relationship
               between sample size and the apparent usefulness of the resulting arm's-length
               ranges.

       I hope this information proves useful. The practical difficulties raised by the problem of
       sample size in transfer pricing analysis will be difficult to address, but I believe doing so
       is essential if tax authorities are to be able to apply TNMM in a reasonably effective
       manner. I would be pleased to discuss this topic further if that would be helpful.

Sub:   Comments on a Draft Toolkit Designed to Help Developing Countries Address the Lack of
Comparables for Transfer Pricing Analyses



       1.   Does this toolkit effectively help address the challenges identified by developing countries
            in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer pricing analysis as part of a tax audit?

       (Comments) I think this toolkit would be very helpful to developing countries. However,
       because there is not specified pattern in TP study, I suggest that many cases should be provided
       for the purpose of additional information.

       2.   How can better use of administrative information, in a way that maintains taxpayer
            confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country and regional level?

       (Comments)
       First, administrative information must be submitted and used by tax authority through the law
       Second, in that situation, another law that can prevent from the abuse of administrative
       information is necessary. Tax authority should control the system of information use and huge
       penalty must be imposed to the abuser.
       Third, systematically DB that handles administrative information must be isolated from public
       network and several layer of firewall is necessary.



       3.   How could the reliability of potential comparables from other geographic markets be
            tested?

        (Comments) In the TP field, Not only developing country but also advanced country have
        difficulties for finding appropriate comparables set within their own country. In some cases,
        we can expand region to neighbor country or continent in order to search comparables. In
        those situation, we could adjust the geometrical and economical difference in order to
        enhance the reliability.



       4.    Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a lack of
               com parables not addressed in the discussion draft?

       (Comments) I could not find any other approaches beyond your draft.




                                                  129
5.   What other adjustments for geographic market differences could be made, and in what
      circumstances? How could the reliability of such adjustments be empirically tested?

(Comments) We do not have any experience for adjustment to the geometrical difference until
 now.

6.      Do the mineral pricing case studies accurately reflect market trading terms? Are there
        other adjustments that would be routinely made when these mineral products are sold?

(Comments) There is no case that is related to the mineral pricing in Korea.

Dear Sir or Madam,

We thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Toolkit released by the
Platform for Collaboration on Tax ("PCT") on January 24, 2017, comprising two separate
documents (i) A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer
Pricing Analyses (the "Draft Toolkit") and (ii) Addressing the Information Gaps on Prices of
Minerals Sold in an Intermediate Form ("the Minerals Draft").

Introduction

As an introductory comment, we would like to stress our strong support for application of the
Arm's Length Principle ("ALP") in controlled transactions, including the transactions that involve
taxpayers in developing countries. We recognize that challenges with implementation of ALP for
developing countries are real, and these challenges have sometimes been cited as reasons for
developing countries to apply methods alternative to the ALP. One of the most often mentioned
challenges with the ALP implementation in developing countries is the absence of reliable data for
independent companies in those countries that could be used as comparables for the purposes of the
transfer pricing analysis. This challenge has led NERA economists to conduct research on
techniques that could potentially help to cope with the absence of comparables data in certain
countries/regions. This research was discussed in the following publications:

Draft Toolkit (e.g., in Part II, Sections 5.3 and 5.5, and in Appendix 14).

In our comments below, we confirm that in cases when suitable local comparables are absent, we
support using comparables from other countries or regions with adjustments for differences in the
economic conditions in which they operate. We believe that this approach is a viable option to cope
with the absence of comparables in a certain country / region, particularly in light of the large
amount of reliable financial information available in certain regions of the world covering a wide
spectrum of industries and functions.

We also agree with the suggestion contained in the Draft Toolkit that the proposed country risk
adjustments techniques need further studies and refinements. While these adjustments have been
used in practice in real transfer pricing cases, additional research and substantiation needs to be
performed to confirm the relevance of such adjustments, the circumstances in which they may
apply, and the limitations of such adjustments.

Our comments below principally focus on the feasibility of using comparables from other regions
and adjustments that can be made to improve reliability of these comparables. We have also
commented on a few other questions posed by the Draft Toolkit authors, but our comments do not
cover the entire range of topics for which comments were requested.

In our opinion, any approach that departs from the ALP is far from ideal. For instance, secret
comparables should be avoided (outside of the risk assessment tools used by tax authorities); safe
harbors, while appealing due to the simplicity of their application, should be used with caution as
their unilateral application may lead to pricing distortions; the Location Specific Advantages
framework may also prove relevant for transfer pricing analysis in developing countries.

Economists at NERA will be pleased to continue assisting the PCT in developing tools thatrely on
sound economic analysis in order to make the ALP implementable in developing countries.

2. How can better use of administrative information, in a way that maintains
taxpayer confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country and regional level?

As mentioned previously, the ALP is not always simple to implement. It relies heavily on facts and
circumstances. As such, it requires an open dialogue between taxpayers and tax administrations.
Consequently, we do not think that the ALP can be, in its very principle, applied where a tax
administration would rely on non-public administrative information ("secret comparables"). Secret
comparables are a way to enforce a policy that pose many disadvantages for taxpayers, such as
pricing distortions, taxpayers, and risk of double taxation.

The Draft Toolkit rightly points out that:

                                  ormation can be highly relevant in practice. Typically, it is the
     "non-public administrative inf
    main source of information for the design of benchmarks for risk assessment guiding audit
    selection"

We certainly agree that tax administrations have a right to design benchmarks using the
information available to them. Yet, the Draft Toolkit should emphasize that such information
should only be used for risk assessment purposes and discourage the use of secret comparables in
tax audit and litigation proceedings, for the reasons stated above.

3. How could the reliability of potential comparables from other geographic markets
be tested?

4. Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a lack of
comparables not addressed in the discussion draft?

5. What other adjustments for geographic market differences could be made, and in
what circumstances? How could the reliability of such adjustments be empirically
tested?

To begin with, reliability of comparables depends first and foremost on functional comparability
between the controlled tested party and the uncontrolled companies selected as candidate
comparables.

Second, when considering using comparables from other regions, it's important to recognize that
markets for different products and activities may have very different geographic footprints: while
markets for some products are services are globalized, markets for others are local.

The comparability analysis should consider both of the above factors. Provided that functional
comparability is established as a first step, the second step would be to determine whether the
market for a given product or service can be described as global, regional, or local. Insights from
the industrial organization field may be helpful as well (industry analysis, market structures, etc.).

Further, companies located in the same country ( or region) as the controlled tested party but that
are not functionally comparable with the tested party should not be expected to serve as proper
comparables. The reason for this is twofold: (1) different functions are expected to have different
economic returns and (2) local companies with dissimilar functions may be involved in value
chains that are entirely different from the one the controlled party operates in.

Let us consider some examples to illustrate the above points.

In the first case, we assume that the market for a given product or service is globalized and
functions in a long-term equilibrium (meaning that first-mover location savings advantages are not
present).

In this scenario, it may be the case that independent companies from one country or region are well
suited as comparables to a controlled party that operates in a different region, and no geographical
                                                  3
comparability adjustments are required.

    Depending on the facts, working capital adjustments may still be considered.

However, if the global market for a product or service is in an evolving mode, certain countries or
regions that are part of the global supply chain may present temporary opportunities for location
savings, and the location savings dynamics will have to be taken into account."

In another case, let's assume that the market for a product or service is localized.

Here, it is likely that an application of functionally comparable independent companies from
another region to test profitability of a local controlled party will require some adjustments,
because companies from economically isolated markets may be expected to earn different rates of
return.

A case when such adjustments are needed may be illustrated as follows:

A controlled taxpayer operates in a Country A that is characterized by:

     •    A high cost of capital (that may be manifested by high yields on government bonds
          denominated in local currency) and, in addition,

     •    The index of the stock market in Country A historically has exhibited very volatile returns
          linked to volatile economic conditions of Country A.

These economic factors indicate a relatively high· risk of investing capital in Country A.

If the identification of a sufficient number of functionally comparable uncontrolled taxpayers based
in Country A proves difficult, it would be reasonable to turn to other regions in search for
comparables.

Let's assume that Country B has a sufficient number of functionally comparable uncontrolled
taxpayers that disclose their financial data. Country B has:

     •    A low cost of capital environment (e.g., yields on government bonds in this country are
          low) and

     •    A relatively stable stock market.

Based on this information, it would be logical to conclude that, for the same type of business
activity, the cost of capital in Country B will be lower than in Country A. Thus, independent
investors in a company located in Country A should be expecting ex-ante to earn a higher return on
their capital than investors in a similarly situated company in Country B. This leads to a conclusion

that profitability of a company located in Country A expected ex-ante should be higher than
profitability of the same company in Country B.

However, due to the higher volatility of the economic conditions in country A, it may be possible
that a company located in Country A earns lower actual returns (i.e., ex-post returns) than the
similar company in Country B (although it is also possible that the returns of a company in Country
A will end up higher than in Country B).

If the arm's length range of returns for Country A is being computed using the comparables from
Country B with the adjustment for economic conditions of Country A, based on the differences in
the cost of capital and market volatility assumed above, the result will likely be that the arm's
length range in Country A:

     •    Will have a higher median and

     •    Be wider compared to Country B. It is even possible that the lower bound of the Country
          A's arm's length range will lie below the lower bound of the unadjusted range derived from
          the Country B comparables.

Thus, in the case of localized markets, when applying results of the comparables from a specific
country or region to a controlled party located in another country characterized by dissimilar cost
of capital and/or economic dynamics, it is important to distinguish between:

     •    Targeting the expected, i.e., ex-ante, returns of the controlled party and

     •    Testing its actual, i.e., ex-post returns.

Targeting of the expected returns can be accomplished by applying the cost-of-capital ("W ACC")
adjustment described in two papers by the NERA authors, 5 while testing of the ex-post outcomes
has to take into account the observable differences in volatility of returns on invested capital. One
such method is discussed in another NERA paper. 6

It is clear, however, that any adjustment methods that involve comparables from a different country
or region should be used with caution. For instance, the above adjustments for countries with
limited liquidity of the markets for government bonds and equities may not be sufficiently reliable.

When using foreign comparables, it is important to consider the degree to which the markets and
the economic conditions of the foreign country are. comparable to the country in question. In
general, it would be preferable to source comparables from the country or region with similar
economic conditions. When the economic and market conditions are dissimilar between the
country from which independent com parables can be drawn and the country of the tested party, we
advocate a case-by-case approach to any comparability adjustments. Such case-by-case approach
should consider a broad set of factors that are similar and different between the countries in
question, such as macroeconomic indicators, efficiency and liquidity of the markets, bargaining
power of the parties, etc.

Many possible qualitative methods to adjust for differences in geographic markets exist or could be
developed. As a general rule, we do not think it is possible or desirable to establish an exhaustive
list of such methods in the Draft Toolkit, even though the Draft Toolkit may contain references to
some methods and best practices, as it does now. We believe that additional research on
comparability across economic regions would be beneficial for further development of this topic.



6. Do the mineral pricing case studies accurately reflect market trading terms? Are
there other adjustments that would be routinely made when these mineral products
are sold?

As a general comment, we note that the Minerals Draft relies heavily on the application of the CUP
method and use of spot market prices for commodities. Based on our experience, many arm's
length arrangements for mineral extraction do not rely on spot market prices. Examples of such
arrangements are long-term contracts, production sharing agreements, streaming agreements, etc.
Moreover, volumes of commodities transacted under such arrangements in certain cases may far
exceed the volumes bought and sold on the spot market.

Additionally, we believe that other methods, such as the TNMM or the Profit Split Method may be
more valid than the CUP method in a number of situations related to the extraction industry. The
fact that multinational groups involved in mineral extraction have integrated operations is often
overlooked by practitioners who are drawn to the application of CUP method based on the mere
fact of availability of pricing information for certain commodities.

We also note that the Mineral Draft does not discuss the concept of Location Specific Advantages
which, based on our experience, may be relevant in this industry.

Oxfam contribution to the document "A toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in accessing
comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analyses"


General comments

This toolkit appears as part of the process of implementing BEPS outcomes and the Arm's
Length Principle (ALP) in developing countries. It attempts to show developing countries how
to find out the price for associated companies transactions following the ALP. We are not sure
this document has accomplished this goal; not because this document is not a good attempt
but due to the complexity and difficulty of the topic. The objective of this document is so
complex because the international taxation standards haven't changed at the rhythm the
economic business reality. The international tax system stands far behind. Therefore, this
document is an attempt to fit developing countries in a tax system that doesn't fit their reality
and global economic development.

In fact, the document recognizes the need for further work on methodologies to be applied in
absence of com parables. For intangibles and integrated value chains there are less
com parables as days pass because those transactions are becoming exclusive/really specific
and unique. Nowadays, as the globalization and new technologies have changed the way
multinationals make their business, the main problem is not accessing comparables but
finding them: their existence, their real availability.

Another fact this document recognizes is the important discretional element and subjectivity
of transfer pricing determination following the ALP. This is also a problem not solved, and at
the heart of profit shifting.

Finally, the goal of this document is delivering practical measures that can be implemented in
the short to medium term. The implementation of the ALP implies really sophisticated
methods and decision systems that are not easy to implement in the short term.

Further work

The document is more realistic at the end when it presents the part on further work on safe
harbours and commodities:

        "7.- Develop further guidance on the use of safe harbours in the application of the
        one-sided methods, including best practices"- Here, it is important to highlight how
        developing countries will be involved in such work.

        "8.- Recognizing the significance of the natural resources and other commodities
        sectors to many developing countries ... "7 Six method approach.

Add to these proposals we would suggest the study of formula apportionment methods and
their impact. The transactional profit split method is the one recommended by the "Platform
for collaboration on tax", when it concerns integrated value chains business operations.

We would also suggest:

    >-   to include an analysis of the impact of the application of CFC rules by industrialized
         and other jurisdictions for the revenues in developing countries in other for
         developing countries to promote and recommend their use and to implement them;
    >-   To map the need for resources to implement the recommendations of this document
         and the resources actually available. The starting point and approach of this document
         should have been the adaptation of the proposed solutions to the reality of
         developing countries. Therefore we propose to start it by the part Ill: approaches to
         applying internationally accepted principles in the absence of com parables. To dig
         deeper in the solutions written in this third part would be really useful for developing
         countries as they count with more limited resources in their tax administrations that
         the industrialized ones.

At the end of the document, we would recommend talking about the expensive databases
available and how publically create them and privately get/buy them. The access to
com parables and its use lead to sophisticated adjustments and difficulties which are resource
intensive and complex for developing countries. These difficulties and sophistication are
mentioned and recognized in the document several times.

On the other hand, we welcome the boxes with good practices. We think those are really
useful for developing countries. Therefore, we would add South - South and regional
collaboration on this topic as a recommendation. In that regard we support the suggestion on
page 56 referred to safe harbor: "it may be useful for countries and regional and international
organizations to assess the potential for building up an international or regional set of data
based on data already in the hands of tax administrations, presented in an aggregated format
that retains taxpayer confidentiality, and subject to transparency of process" .

Following this line on positive practices, we would suggest to elaborate a summary box at the
beginning of the document on when it would be recommended to apply each method for
determining the TP of a transaction between associated companies.

  PwC's Comments on the Draft Toolkit to help developing countries
  address the lack of comparables for transfer pricing analyses
  PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited, on behalf of the Network Member Firms of PwC (PwC),
  thanks the Global Tax Platform for the opportunity to provide comments on the draft toolkit to help
  developing countries address the lack of comparables for transfer pricing analyses.

  The BEPS project seeks to prevent profit shifting and to preserve the tax base by focussing on transparency
  and aligning transfer pricing outcomes with value creation. In the implementation phase, the focus lies on
  a coherent and inclusive approach, evident in the namesake 'Inclusive Framework' in which developing
  countries stand on an equal footing with OECD members. Against this backdrop, the discussion draft
  focuses on the determination of comparable market prices from the perspective of developing economies'
  tax administrations, who often tackle a lack oflocal comparable datato derive market prices from as well
  as a lack of transfer pricing audit capacity.

  While the initiative is welcomed and the need for further guidance recognised, we believe the discussion
  draft could provide additional context on the significant role of one-sided transfer pricing policies
  particularly in view of the transparency agenda visible in several BEPS work streams but notably Actions
  8-10 (Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation) and Action 13 (Transfer Pricing
  Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting) of the BEPS project. This is especially pressing in
  light of the holistic functional analyses considered in the revision of Chapter I (in particular with regard to
  Risk) and Chapter V (a three tiered approach including the Master File concept), but also in light of the
  OECD discussion draft on BEPS Actions 8-10 - Revised Guidance on Profit Splitsi, which references value
  chain analysis as a tool in helping to accurately delineate the actual transaction. Additional guidance could
  facilitate the necessary transparency tax authorities desire to put the contributions by local operations into
  a broader global context.

  The comments in this submission only address in detail the toolkit, except in relation to question 6 where
  reference is made to the Discussion Draft Addressing the Information Gaps on Prices of Minerals sold in
  an Intermediate Form (Minerals DD).

  Our main comments are summarized below:

  •           General:
              This toolkit is only one of several publications, some still in the pipeline, by partners of the Platform.
              On 23 December 2016, the World Bank Group published the handbook Transfer Pricing and
              Developing Economies: A Handbook for Policy Makers and Practitioners. The UN is preparing the
              second edition of the Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries for publication
              this year. Further, as a result of BEPS, we are still awaiting the updated version of the OECD
              Transfer Pricing Guidelines (TPG). We recognise the value of these efforts and the need for such
              toolkits, and see this joint initiative by the Platform as an opportunity to bring the separate
              publications together to provide coherent, unified guidance to tax administrations and taxpayers.

              We also believe there is a benefit in making the toolkit an on-going initiative allowing the
              opportunity of regular feed-back reviews and updates.

  •           Cooperative compliance:
              This toolkit provides guidance from the perspective of developing economies' tax administrations in
              an audit situation. Though we agree the audit and dispute aspect is very important, the toolkit
              should also address the compliance perspective of taxpayers, who face similar issues with lack of
              comparable data. Aware that new systems take time to implement and that capacity building is a
              long-term goal, we suggest to highlight this toolkit as a platform for a collaborative approach
              between taxpayer and tax administration, allowing for real-time reviews and taxpayer-tax
              authorities' co-operation rather than retrospective adjustments in tax audits.

  •           Prescriptive rules:
              We generally believe that using prescriptive rules in transfer pricing is not appropriate. In light of
              the differences between locally established methods, for example, the existing variations of the
              'sixth method' under domestic law of certain countries (as recognised on p. 18 of the discussion
              draft), we question whether this approach provides important consistency in the application of
              those locally established methods. A unilateral application of such rules and thus a generalization of
              this model carries a danger of double taxation. This is especially true in cases where prescriptive
              rules and commodity prices deviate from the arm's length price and lack a mechanism for the
              taxpayer to demonstrate that a different approach may be considered the market price for a good or
              service. Further, the toolkit needs clarification on the access to domestic appeal procedures and
              MAP under the commodity pricing or other prescriptive approaches. This is raised particularly in
              light of the reference as an anti-avoidance measure, which may limit the access to MAP for the
              application of national regulations.

            When countries choose to apply prescriptive rules for determining arm's length results, it is
            important that the outcomes under the prescriptive rules:

            1.    approximate an arm's length result;
            2.    provide the taxpayer with the possibility to demonstrate that the transfer pricing approach it
                  has considered in the related party transaction is at arm's length; and
            3.    allow access to appeal procedures and MAP in case the prescriptive rule is used as an anti-
                  avoidance measure.

  •         Safe harbours:
            In general, we support the use of bilateral and multilateral safe harbours and APAs. This should
            promote pro-active sharing of industry information to frame comparability, and over time lead to
            greater consensus on factors influencing comparability. Safe harbours should however not be used
            in a manner that overrides the arm's length principle by imposing unilateral or irrefutable directives
            for an assumed arm's length compensation. In this regard, we refer to our comments on prescriptive
            rules above.

  •         Secret comparables and confidentiality:
            The use of secret comparables to perform a transfer pricing adjustment should not be encouraged in
            the toolkit. Secret com parables may be used in a transfer pricing risk assessment or case selection as
            well as the circumstances described in paragraph 3.36 of the OECD TPG. In this regard, tax
            authorities should be mindful of the commercial sensitivity of taxpayer information in an open
            economy, as well as the competition law concerning disclosure of information. We further
            encourage developing economies to sign up to, and adhere to, the international standard on the
            (automatic) exchange of information and allow for provisions in domestic law that also meet those
            standards, providing access to a series of useful documentation, including the country-by-country
            (CbC) reports, if all requirements are met. In such cases developing economies may need to build
            the necessary capacity, including access to the electronic tools as well as training for tax authority
            staff.

  •         Adjustment calculations:
            Comparability adjustments should be applied in a balanced way and performed only when
            enhancing the reliability of the analysis rather than a formulaic approach. A thorough
            comparability, including functional, analysis should be preferred, leading to an understanding of the
            circumstances and conditions of the transactions. Whether comparability adjustments are needed
            also depends on the compliance burden and costs related to such adjustments and the relative value
            of the adjustments in enhancing reliability. It also requires good judgement. Reference could be

  Appendix 1: Questionnaire responses



  In the following, we provide responses to the questions provided in the press release.

          1.   Does this toolkit effectively help address the challenges identified by developing
               countries in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer pricing analysis as
               part of a tax audit?

  As  a starting point, adherence to and compliance with the arm's length principle should be the overriding
  objective and in no way should provide for major deviations from the arm's length standard.
  In this regard, we particularly welcome the use of safe harbours in order to meet and simplify some of the
  needs and problems of both tax administrations and taxpayers.
  Of note is that the issues addressed with this toolkit are valid not only for developing economies, but also
  developed economies that face a lack of reliable information on local market comparables.

          2.   How can [we make] better use of administrative information, in a way that
               maintains taxpayer confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country and
               regional level?

  The term 'administrative information' is unclear and may include secret com parables, i.e. market
  information that is accessible to the tax administration but not available in the public domain. On the use
  of secret com parables, please see our general comments in the main body of this submission.
  Another issue to be considered is the impact of governmental regulators other than tax administrations,
  which may provide pricing information for certain products. While these prices are recognized as useful
  e.g. to estimate differences between local prices and international quotes, they should serve as information
  only to determine the arm's length price. Alternative sources should be admitted when they are shown to
  deviate from market prices. This is particularly true in cases where such reference prices serve to establish
  incentives or disincentives related to economic policies, rather than report the market value of a product
  or service.

          3.   How could the reliability of potential comparables from other geographic
               markets be tested?

  In our view there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution; instead, geographic and local considerations and case-
  by-case evaluations are required. In particular, the comparability of data will depend on whether the
  transaction takes place in a global market, regional market or a local market, being higher for global rather
  than regional transactions. In this regard, we welcome further work on the factors of comparability for
  non-domestic comparables.
  Further, we support the notion to reduce overly strict independence criteria where there is a lack of
  reliable comparables.
  Critical are different approaches to safe harbours (bilateral / multilateral / regional), which can serve the
  benefit of both tax administrations and taxpayers, in reaching an appropriate tax result and avoiding

pwc
  double taxation. While references to safe harbours are made in the toolkit, the addition of the
  memorandum of understanding for competent authorities to establish bilateral safe harbours as provided
  in the revised Annex I to Chapter IV of the OECD TPG is deemed helpful. With regards to the use of
  unilateral safe harbours and the related danger of potential double taxation we refer to our general
  comments on prescriptive rules and safe harbours in the main body of this submission.

            4.   Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a lack of
                 comparables not addressed in the discussion draft?

  For commodities transactions, a lack of local reference prices should only lead to the use of international
  quoted prices if they can accurately reflect the dynamics of the local market and, if necessary, after making
  adjustments. Quoted prices particularly in organized transparent markets (e.g. Chicago Board of Trade,
  London Metal Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange, etc.) may in certain cases not fully reflect
  transactions of physical products, but rather the supply and demand of financial hedges. The use of
  standardized contracts and the possibility of settling an obligation through taking an offsetting position
  without delivery of physical goods allows for the participation of agents whose main purpose is to hedge
  variations in the general commodity price level, allowing large volumes of transactions not representative
  of actual goods and service deliveries. While these markets have a fundamental role in the process of price
  discovery, they might differ from transactions involving the exchange of physical products and often apply
  pricing formulas, thus providing a statistical framework that for specific tested transactions may serve as
  information only. This may be true also for fixed-price transactions common in the agricultural market,
  since fixed prices are negotiated taking into consideration the dynamics of the market in terms of quotes,
  premiums and discounts, at the moment in which the transaction is carried out.

  To deduct applicable market prices and assure comparability versus the quotation price, the following
  should be taken into consideration:

      •      Internal comparable uncontrolled transactions between the tested parties and independent third
             parties where a premium or discount is applied to the quoted price

      •      Published prices by reporting agencies or brokers for transactions with specific characteristics
             (products of a certain quality, delivered in a specific place and under regular conditions).

      •      Comparability adjustments based on specifics of the tested transactions such as data on freight
             costs, quality premiums or discounts for non-standard products. This may be based on internal
             data with independent third parties of market data and standards.



            5.   What other adjustments for geographic market differences could be made, and
                 in what circumstances? How could the reliability of such adjustments be
                 empirically tested?

  We have no additional suggested adjustments for geographic market differences.

pwc
  However, of note is that an increase in profit potential - as is demonstrated in the examples in the toolkit
  - does not necessarily lead to an increased actual profit, and could even result in a loss, on realisation of
  the increased risk.

  We question the adjustments as described in Appendix 13 as it suggests a correlation between higher
  country risk and higher profits. Although the OECD TPG consider the assumption of risks to be a crucial
  part of the functional analysis and the process of delineating a transaction, we disagree with the notion
  that the assumption of greater risks carries the effective realisation of greater profits. If anything, the
  assumption of greater risk could result in more volatile results. This is equally important in the context of
  country risk adjustments where some Revenue Authorities expect a premium because of country risk. Risk
  equally implies the potential for profit and loss. With regards to the country risk adjustment, we suggest
  expanding the range to account for the volatility rather than increasing the profitability of the tested party
  operating in a different market than the comparable.


            6.   Do the mineral pricing case studies accurately reflect market trading terms? Are
                 there other adjustments that would be routinely made when these mineral
                 products are sold?

  We welcome the additional guidance and insight this document provides and would note that it includes
  useful examples, both in the case studies of the draft toolkit and in the Minerals DD, as we consider the
  latter is a particularly helpful tool for providing transparency to the pricing mechanism of this industry.
  We also stress that the Minerals DD should not be viewed and applied in isolation, but rather in
  accordance with the draft toolkit and existing transfer pricing guidance. Similarly, the formulaic approach
  proposed in the Minerals DD should be used as helpful guidance to determine the arm's length price,
  taking into account the facts and circumstances of the individual case. This is especially true for, examples
  which deviate from the specifics of provided examples, for which the approach needs to be reviewed. We
  therefore recommend that the toolkit should discourage attempts to extrapolate the principles and
  conclusions reached in the examples to other minerals without a detailed analysis of the underlying
  transaction.

  Appendix 2: Detailed Comments



  The following provides comments not directly linked to the questions above, addressing primarily editorial
  concerns and suggestions under the different parts or sections. The comments follow the structure of the
  toolkit.



  Part I: Introduction - Addressing the difficulties in performing comparability analyses

  The first couple of paragraphs seem to put a lot of focus on the transfer 'price', while price is only a part of
  the conditions that may influence the profit allocation between related parties in accordance with the
  arm's length principle. We would suggest that the term 'price' be explained in that sense.



  Part II: Issues arising when conducting a comparability analysis

  Section 1, p.9: Selection of the most appropriate method

  Original text: 'Once this [accurately delineating the transaction] is understood, it is necessary to select the
  most appropriate transfer pricing method and identify one or more potential uncontrolled transactions
  that may be considered comparable'.

  We suggest clarifying that the selection of the most appropriate transfer pricing method to the
  circumstances of the case does not need to be performed straight after the delineation of the transaction.
  As indicated in the table under section 2 and in contrast to the typical process for determining a
  comparability analysis under the OECD TPG, the most appropriate method is only selected after
  accurately delineating the transaction and the initial review of comparables information (see paragraph
  2.2 of the OECD TPG: There are four principles on the selection of the most appropriate transfer pricing
  method covering: strengths and weaknesses of the methods; appropriateness of the method in view of the
  controlled transaction, based in particular on a functional analysis; availability of reliable information (in
  particular comparables); and reliability of comparability adjustments).

  We suggest to edit the above sentence as follows: 'Once this is understood and one or more potential
  uncontrolled transactions that may be considered comparable have been identified, it is
  necessary to select the most appropriate transfer pricing method'.

pwc
  Section 2.2, p. 11: Clear priority of substance over form when the contractual relations and the conduct
  are misaligned                  ·

  Original text: 'It is important to verify any contractual terms by reference to the conduct of the parties.
  While a transfer pricing analysis will typically start from the related party contracts, there is a clear
  priority of substance over form to the extent the two are misaligned.'

  We believe the guidance as drafted could be misinterpreted in such a way that the tax administration is
  allowed to disregard or re-characterise the transaction as it sees fit. We also believe that this is not the
  intention of the guidance and would be contrary to the revised guidance under the BEPS action plan.
  Further there could be cases where the contract and the conduct of the parties are aligned, but the
  transaction as such may not have substance. Care should be taken that a tax administration does not
  replace a valid commercial transaction by its own interpretation of what the transaction should look like.

  The sentences could be revised as follows: 'It is important to verify any contractual terms by reference to
  the conduct of the parties. While a transfer pricing analysis will typically start from the related party
  contracts, when the substance and the form are clearly misaligned or inconsistent the transaction
  will be determined according to the conduct of the parties.'

  Section 2.2 (and Appendix 1): Functional analysis and questionnaire

  The referenced questionnaire provides a detailed overview of the functions and risks that may occur in a
  multinational enterprise. The warning that the questionnaire should be tailored to the facts and
  circumstances of the specific case is welcomed. The risk still remains, however, that the list will be copied
  and sent to the taxpayer without adaption to the specific circumstances. We have noticed that the
  questionnaire does not address issues related to assets, which is one of the three factors under a functional
  analysis.

  Further, under BEPS Action 13 on transfer pricing documentation, guidance on the master filea and local
  file concept was developed. The master file should contain a brief functional analysis at group level and the
  local file should contain 'a detailed comparability and functional analysis of the taxpayer and relevant
  associated enterprises with respect to each documented category of controlled transactions, including any
  changes compared to prior years'. We understand from footnote 48 that a toolkit on transfer pricing
  documentation will be developed. In anticipation of the toolkit on documentation we believe that this
  toolkit on comparability could make reference to the Master File and Local File concept as developed
  under BEPS Action 13. It would help the developing economies in accessing the appropriate information
  for risk assessment and case selection and would assist the multinational enterprise in streamlining the
  transfer pricing documentation.

  Finally, the ongoing work of the Platform to provide additional guidance on the use of the profit split
  method (PSM) references value chain analysis as a tool in helping to delineate the actual transaction.


  3   A reference to the master file can only found in appendix 8 and footnote 16 of the toolkit.

pwc
  Additional guidance could facilitate the necessary transparency tax authorities desire to put the
  contributions by local operations into a broader global context.

  Section 2.2: Assumption of risk

  In line with the comment above, a developing economy (lacking audit and information capacity) would be
  best served in performing a detailed analysis as described on p. 12 with access to the Master File and the
  Local File as developed by guidance under BEPS Action 13 or a value chain analysis as proposed by the
  discussion draft on 'BEPS Actions 8-10 - Revised Guidance on Profit Splits'.

  Section 2.2, p.13: Opportunistic behaviour of the taxpayer in choosing the transfer pricing method

  Original text: 'many income tax systems are based on self-assessment under which the taxpayer chooses
  the transfer pricing method. Tax authorities must be alert to the possibility of opportunistic behaviour in
  this choice.'

  We would welcome more balanced wording in this context. First, the taxpayer choosing the transfer
  pricing method is the norm, both under a self-assessment approach and under an audit approach.
  Secondly, this choice should be based on the four criteria defined in paragraph 2.2 of the OECD TPG,
  which limits the element of opportunism as currently suggested in the draft toolkit.

  Section 2.4, p. 14: CUP method application

  Original text: 'The CUP method is most often applied:

  .
  •

  •
        where an internal comparable is available;
           [ ... ]
          for the licensing of some intangibles, particularly where the license is not unique and valuable, to
          benchmark a royalty rate.'

  In line with previous comments, we suggest to revise the text as follows:

  'The CUP method is most often reliably applied:

  •       where an internal comparable is available, provided it meets the same functional analysis as

  .
  •
          the controlled transaction;
           [ ... ]
          for the licensing of some intangibles, particularly where the license is not unique and valuable, to
          benchmark a royalty rate and comparable market data is available.'

pwc
  Section 2.4, p.15, 16: TNMM application

  The guidance could clarify that 'net profit' should be interpreted as operational profit in most cases
  (EBIT).

  The guidance could also better indicate how the Berry ratio can be used for limited risk intermediary
  enterprises with no intangibles, as follows.

  Original text: 'Berry ratio for limited risk intermediary enterprises with no intangibles, i.e. where the
  tested party buys from and sells to associates (for example, sales facilitation services).'

  We would suggest to slightly modify the bullet as follows: 'Berry ratio for limited risk intermediary
  enterprises with no unique or valuable intangibles, i.e. where the tested _party buys from and sells to
  associates (for example, sales facilitation services).'

  Section 2.4.2: Commodity pricing and prescriptive approaches

  With regards to the definition and description of these approaches, we suggest to use the wording reflected
  under the BEPS Action 8-10 and which will be included under paragraphs 2.16A to 2.16E of the revised
  OECD TPG. See also our general comments above on prescriptive rules in the main body of this
  submission.

  Section 3.2 (p.22): Sources ofpotential comparables data and typical types of data used

  Original text: 'However, in practice, application of the arm's length principle is heavily reliant in practice
  on external com parables'

  Suggest to remove the repetition of the term 'in practice' and revise as follows: 'However, in practice,
  application of the arm's length principle is heavily reliant on external com parables.'

  Section 4.1.1: Information in the hands of the tax authority

  The guidance provides a balanced view on the use of secret comparables. The use of such secret
  com parables to perform transfer pricing adjustments should however be discouraged. Such secret
  com parables can at most be used for transfer pricing risk assessment or case selection for audit, see
  paragraph 3.36 of the OECD TPG.

  Section 4.1.2 (p.32): Customs data

  Original text: 'However, mis pricing can also affect customs values.'

  We welcome the general use of the term arm's length pricing or non-arm's length pricing. These terms are
  neutral and thus preferable over other terms which could be misbalanced towards intent to incorrectly set
  the transfer price.

  Section 5: Determination of and making comparability adjustments where appropriate

  See general comments above on comparability adjustments in the main body of this submission.

  Section 6.1: Arm's length range

  Section 6.1 on arm's length range suggests on p. 47 'capping' a wide range by determining the highest point
  in the range as not exceeding a certain percentage of the lowest point of the range. The term capping is
  understood to include both floor and ceiling, which should be included in a definition. In this case, two
  issues may arise. The first relates to whether such capping is in accordance with the arm's length principle
  and the arm's length range approach, in particular when all the com parables left in the set are equally
  reliable, but still lead to a wide range. The second relates to the fact that the other tax administration may
  not accept the capping of the range, leading to controversy and possibly unresolved double taxation. When
  a country decides to have a range cap in its domestic law, appropriate appeal procedures and access to
  MAP should be warranted. In case the analysis results in a wide range, it may be more appropriate to make
  use of statistical approaches. Further the taxpayer should be able to demonstrate that the wide range is
  still an arm's length range.

  Part III: Approaches to applying internationally accepted principles in the absence of
  com parables

  Section 1: Objective

  On p. 52, mention is made that many developing economies that report a lack of capacity negotiate an
  arm's length result. This statement suggests that tax administrations in the first instance conduct their
  own analysis and conclude with an arm's length outcome in all cases. This may be misleading, as a
  separate analysis is not the initial purpose of an audit.                         ·

  Section 3.1: Testing the benefit received

  We agree with and understand the benefit test in the framework of services (under the revised OECD TPG
  as a result of the BEPS Action 8-10 Report) and possibly in the framework of intangibles (although the
  OECD TPG do not refer to a benefit test in the framework of intangibles).

  The benefit test is part of the discussion about whether a service is or has been rendered. As such, the
  benefit test has a place in the first part of the comparability analysis, namely the delineation of the actual
  transaction. It is not clear to us, however, how the benefit test leads to the correct determination of an
  arm's length result in the absence of comparables. It only indicates that a transaction would have been
  performed between independent enterprises under similar conditions.

  Section 4: Safe Harbours

  See our general comments on safe harbours in the main body of this submission and response to question
  3 in Appendix 1.

  Section 4.3: Other prescriptive rules

  See our general comments on prescriptive rules in the main body of this submission. As above, when
  countries choose to apply prescriptive rules for determining arm's length results, it is important that the
  outcomes under the prescriptive rules:

         1.    approximate arm's length result;
  2.           provide the taxpayer with the possibility to demonstrate that the transfer pricing approach it
         has considered in the related party transaction is at arm's length; and
  3.           allow access to appeal procedures and MAP in case the prescriptive rule is used as an anti-
         avoidance measure.

  Section 5: Profit split methods

  It is unclear why the PSM is discussed as an approach that can be applied under internationally accepted
  principles in the absence of comparables. Although the use of the PSM does not require the existence of
  comparables as such, the lack of com parables is not a factor for selecting the PSM, as also indicated in the
  toolkit. The guidance of the toolkit correctly states that both parties must make unique and valuable
  contributions to the transaction or the operations might be highly integrated. The question remains of
  course whether these are the only situations in which the PSM can be reliably applied (see also next
  paragraph of this comment). The fact that no comparables exist or are difficult to retrieve is not a
  sufficient reason to select the PSM as the appropriate transfer pricing method. The inclusion of the
  discussion on the PSM in a section on absence of comparables (in all cases) might therefore be confusing
  or lead to the application of the PSM under inappropriate circumstances.

  Also, in light of the further work by the OECD on developing additional guidance on the use of the PSM,
  we believe that the guidance on the use of PSM by the Platform should be aligned. This is suggested in
  order not to arrive at divergent approaches between developed and developing economies in the
  application of the PSM.

  Section 6: Valuation techniques

  We welcome the reference to valuation techniques and its guidance in the OECD TPG (as revised under
  BEPS Action 8-10).

  Section 7: Advance Pricing Arrangements

  We welcome the guidance on APAs. We acknowledge that the conclusion of (in particular bilateral or
  multilateral) APAs can be very resource intensive and time consuming (from the perspective of the

  taxpayer and the tax administration). However, we believe that in line with the development of the revised
  guidance on safe harbours and the Memoranda of Understanding for low risk activities, a fast track AP A-
  policy for similar low risk transactions could be developed.

  Section 8: Anti-avoidance and other tax base protection measures

  See previous comments on section 4.3.

  Part IV: Summary, conclusions and recommendations for further work

  Section 3: Recommendations for further work

  We welcome the list of topics where further work may be done and share our willingness to contribute to
  this further work.

  In addition to the current list of topics, we propose adding the need to examine the possibility of fast track
  AP As for low risk activities, similar to the (bilateral) Memoranda of Understanding on safe harbours.

  Case studies

  All three case studies concern step one of the revised OECD TPG under BEPS Action 8-10: the delineation
  of the transaction. Further, the case studies illustrate situations where the taxpayer seems to have
  incorrectly delineated the transaction, potentially implying that every transfer pricing case poses a high
  risk that the taxpayer has the intention to file an incorrect tax return. We suggest to provide more
  balanced examples which additionally illustrate the following cases where:
  •      the taxpayer has delineated the transaction correctly, but both taxpayer and tax administration face
         difficulties in finding reliable com parables;
  •      the taxpayer has delineated the transaction correctly, but the taxpayer and the tax administration
         disagree about the return based upon com parables:
  •      the taxpayer has performed a comparability analysis to the best of the available comparables; and
  •      the tax administration has performed another benchmark study.

  Appendices

  Appendix ie

  Appendix 12 presents an empirical analysis comparing firm profitability across certain manufacturing and
  distribution industries in Europe. The analysis finds that there is variability of profitability results in
  different countries for a given industry. It is not clear what practical conclusions can be drawn from such
  an analysis for tax administrations. It is our view that the comparability of a foreign firm should not be
  determined by aggregate industry-level testing but should instead be based on the facts and circumstances
  of the transaction under review. Furthermore, the analysis presented in Appendix 12 relies on data for
  Europe, which is well known to be heavily represented in public databases. Conducting similar analyses

  for developing countries may be difficult as large volumes of firm-level data are not generally available in
  public databases for these countries.

  Appendix ig

  Both examples seem to perform a country risk adjustment based on long-term government bonds. It
  would seem appropriate to include further examples using other adjustment parameters.

  The adjustments have the effect that the return of the tested party is increased because of the higher risk
  factor of the country where the tested party is located. From the point of view of an active party dealing
  with the tested party in the 'higher risk' country, that active party may assume higher risk such as non-
  repatriation of royalty payments, blocking of goods at frontiers, social movements and unrests or riots, etc.
  It remains highly doubtful who should receive the 'benefit of the increased risk'.

  Appendix u;

  The interquartile range calculated via Excel is just one of various methodologies for estimating Quartiles.
  Being a statistical approach, the toolkit should provide options (e.g. referenced in a footnote) rather than
  favouring one approach via exclusive display. This would allow for the evaluation of various quartiles as
  well as methodologies for estimating the defined range.

  Appendix iq

  This appendix contains illustrative safe harbour legislation for routine manufacturing activities. Similar
  illustrative legislation could be made available for other low risk activities. We also suggest to replace the
  term 'routine' with the term 'low risk'.

  Appendix zo

  Reference is made to the OECD TPG - safe harbour on low value-adding intra-group services under the
  revised Chapter VII (BEPS Action 8-10). The safe harbour margin/ mark-up under the elective
  simplification approach on low value-adding intra-group services is fixed at 5% (no range).

Platform for Collaboration on Tax Comments to the draft toolkit to address the lack
of comparables on developing countries



Gentlemen,

We appreciate the opportunity to provide our opinion on the lack of comparables in
developing countries. We hope to contribute positively to the discussion and we remain
attentive to the developments or requests of the platform on this topic.

1. Does this toolkit effectively help address the challenges identified by developing
countries in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer pricing analysis as part
of a tax audit? In general terms yes. It would have been useful a more structured analysis
on the positions taken by the national tax authorities to document the existence of specific
reject patterns to the sets of comparable transactions proposed by the taxpayers.

2. How can better use of administrative information, in a way that maintains
taxpayer confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country and regional level? It
entirely depends on the national governments the approval of regulations requesting the
disclose of business information about the taxpayer's operations. Nevertheless, we
highlight the Colombian case, where there is the obligation to provide business and
financial information to the "super intendencia de sociedades", due to the law 222-1995 on
its articles 83, 84 and 85 (inspection, surveillance and control of Colombian entities). All
the information is gathered in a database (SIREM) which publicly disclosed this
information. A similar approach can be used in the emerging economies.

                                      Practice




3. How could the reliability of potential comparables from other geographic markets
be tested? In our view, a quantitative approach is needed. For instance, a correlative
analysis of market structures, competition, country risk and sensitivity levels to exogenous
variables can be used as an approach. It is also necessary to consider that for commercial
purposes, many industries classify its markets according to certain criteria. V.gr. in the
pharmaceuticals industry it is commonly used the concept of "pharmerging market 1" in
reference to markets with similar levels of economic development2 and attractive to the
companies. Possibly, economies belonging to the same tier within this classification can
be used as comparables in a transfer pricing analysis.

4. Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a lack of
comparables not addressed in the discussion draft? We noticed that the potential use
of a foreign tested company from a developed country wasn't discussed. This alternative
becomes viable considering the lack of information in the emerging markets, eventhough if
the foreign associated company wouldn't be the simplier one in the transaction, as
suggested by the OECD TP Guidelines 3. A review of the policies adopted by the national
goverments following this alternative would be ideal to confirm this approach as possibility
of analysis.

5. What other adjustments for geographic market differences could be made, and in
what circumstances? How could the reliability of such adjustments be empirically
tested?

According to Appendix 12 of the toolkit, "limited empirical basis for drawing on unadjusted
international market data", it is concluded in the Meenan et al. (2004) studies that
"European arm's length ranges do not statistically differ from country-specific arm's length
ranges in almost all cases." As an alternative to the abovementioned approach, we
suggest for the emerging markets the use of the Hirschman Herfindahl Index, in our
example with data of the refining oil industry. Our approach looks for the elimination of the
differences originated in geographic markets, because of the potential effect in the prices
or margins of a product or service. Under the principles of perfect competition, prices must
be identical from one place to another, regardless of the geographic market. The
differences arise due to a concentration of the industry. Therefore, the following hypothesis
is proposed:



       "Because of higher levels of competition, the prices or margins in a developed
market will be lower than the prices or margins obtained in an emerging market"

Hirschman Herfindahl Index is proposed to know the concentration conditions in an
industry, based on the following:




                                             159

                                   Practice




Where:

Q1 = Percentage share of the company in the market.

N = Number of companies in the market.

It is also possible to calculate the normalized Hirschman - Herfindhal index (HHI), to
delimit the values:


         (HHI - _!)
HHIN=            1
                     °    05H51
           1- -
              n

Where:

HHI is Hirschman - Herfindahl Index.

HHIN is Hirschman - Herfindahl normalized Index.

To define it, the following values are required:

(*) In the case of countries that assume the value of 1 in the calculation of the Hirschman - Herfindhal Index, it is clear that
only a public company operates, or that the conditions of competition are dominated by some local regulation, therefore is
not possible to apply the analysis under these circumstances.


In the first case, there are countries with a diversified market that have in their system of
internal competence an index value below 0.10. Such is the case of the following
countries.

The results obtained in the regression shown that an increase of 100 points in the index
produces an increase of 11.107% in the profit margin, which means that there is a
correlation of 43.02% between the profit margin and the index. Since there is a positive
relation between the index and the profit margin, the hypothesis proposed that the margin
increases as the index increases is confirmed.

In case of Russia it was not possible to verify the observations, with a total of 8 companies
in the industry, it is practically controlled by 3 companies with 96.89% of the market, only
Gazprom and respective subsidiaries control 40.69% of the total industry, presenting data
completely contrary to the main hypothesis, with negative relation, indicating in first
instance, that the companies obtain profits that are not determined by the market
conditions.

Even though the market conditions, the profit margins of the companies belonging to this
segment were not determined by the level of competition in the market or by the economic
circumstances and therefore (technically the effect is cero), the profit margins are more
related with their local regulation than with the economic circumstances.

Looking at the ranges we can notice that there is a significant difference in the profit
margins between the concentrated and diversified markets, the case of a moderately
concentrated market is illustrated by Russia. The distribution of quartiles is more stable in
diversified markets, by contrast, in the less competitive markets, there are greater
variations in the profit margins, so the same practice is proposed for different industries in
order to select comparable countries whose economic characteristics are similar according
to the level of competition in the market.

6. Do the mineral pricing case studies accurately reflect market trading terms? Are
there other adjustments that would be routinely made when these mineral products
are sold?

In our opinion the cases reflect properly the market trading terms. In any case, it is
important to confirm the market level associated to the transaction in order to adjust the
price or margin due to this potential differences. Additionally it is important to confirm the
activities performed by this kind of companies in emerging markets (considering that
functionally speaking, they might be different from their peers in developed countries).
Finally the effect of governmental policies must be addressed.

I.        Introduction

Our comments will be structured as follows: First, we shall present our views addressing the lack
of comparables for transfer pricing analyses based on the content of the Toolkit, before
providing answers to some of the questions set out to consider in the invitation to
commentators.



II.       Views addressing the lack of comparables for transfer pricing analyses
          based on the content of the Toolkit

A.        Part II: Issues arising when conducting a comparability analysis

1.        The com parables search process (Section 3.4.1)

We welcome the outlining of a typical search process for comparables using commercial
databases as it provides certainty in dealing with day-to-day practice in Transfer Pricing.
Furthermore, the outlined typical process matches our long-standing practice, which in our
experience has been yielding high quality results in terms of comparability.

However, the guidelines of this process should be broadened to help both tax administrations
and practitioners by including the following aspects which may help in reducing disputes:

      •   How to document the complete screening process: which information should be
          recorded, in which detail, etc.

      •   How to prove that the source used (e.g. website) actually contained the information
          used to accepVreject a comparable when performing the benchmark in such a way that
          it could be considered as sufficient evidence in a tax audit: e.g. type of record,
          recommended extension for the acceptance/rejection comments, screenshots, saved
          HTML, saved PDF version, use of specific software, etc.

In this regard, this Toolkit or the future toolkit on Transfer Pricing Documentation would be an
opportunity to create a standard in order to reduce disputes arising from the search process and
its documentation so as to set the focus on comparability.

One approach that may overcome the lack of comparables in developing countries and/or the
access to commercial database by the tax administrations of these countries, would be that both
the taxpayers and the tax authorities agree upon a search process before carrying it out. The
preparation of the search process could be assumed by the taxpayer, but with the commitment
of both parties to accept the outcome of the search once it is finalized, as long as sufficient
comparables were to be identified. This solution would be also valid for several taxpayers from
the same market and/or region.

Besides giving guidance in respect to the search process it is from our point of view necessary to
provide additional guidance concerning the acceptable level of comparability.

                                                                               Rodl & Partner

 Against the background of the five economically comparability factors 1 the comparability
 analysis through external data seems impossible. See below a few examples:

       •    Contractual terms of the transaction: The comparability of contractual terms cannot
            be directly observed by database analyses. From our perspective, the sole search for EBIT-
            margins makes a comparability of contractual terms not necessary.

       •   Functional analysis: Through the manual review of potential comparable companies,
           only an assumption of the overall functions performed, overall risks born and overall
           assets used could be derived. In many cases it is difficult to define the level of
           comparability in respect to the functional profile of the potential comparable entity (e.g.
           the related routine contract manufacturer does not perform any distribution activities,
           whereas a third party (contract) manufacturing company in any case is performing at
           least a minimum of distribution functions).

       •   The business strategies pursued by the parties: The comparability of business
           strategies cannot be observed by database analyses. From our perspective, the sole
           search for EBIT-margins makes a comparability of business strategies not necessary in
           each case.

 A recommendation how to proceed within the qualitative screening and what should get special
 attention would be very welcomed.


 2.         Information in the hands of the tax authority (Section 4.1.1)

 In principle, we welcome the general refusal of the use of secret comparables. In connection
 with the use of this kind of information it comes, in our view, very rapidly to an imbalance
 between the tax authority and the taxpayer. For price setting those secret data are not available
 to the taxpayer. Thus the taxpayer endeavours to apply public information in order to create
 arm's length conditions. Therefore, the tax authorities cannot blame taxpayers for acting not
 arm's length on the basis of secret comparables.

  Furthermore, the use of secret comparables would expose the taxpayer to his arbitrariness and
  in this respect a refutation of acting arm's length cannot take place. This is of fundamental
. importance in cases where only poor data are available.


 3.        Wider selection of data (Section 4.2)

 We have observed that the independence criterion is a requirement with a wide variety of
 approaches across different jurisdictions. With respect to benchmarking we recommend to treat
 entities having shareholdership relations to other entities below 50 per cent as independent. Up
 to this shareholdership there should be no motivation to shift profits for tax purposes. This could
 increase the amount of potential comparables. Additionally, it should be taken into account
 which characteristics of the shareholders relations may affect the Profit Level Indicator (PLI) of
 the potential comparable. In this regard, a company which is totally controlled by an individual
 may perform transactions with its shareholder at operating level (e.g. wages, payment of
 services, payment of costs) causing relatively low impact. Furthermore, an entity might be used

DISCUSSION DRAFT:
A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data
                                                                            Rodl & Partner

as comparable if it can be proved that no business relation to affiliated companies were
conducted although it is part of a group.

However, commercial databases usually do not disclose information on related party
transactions amounts. In this regard, it may be helpful that tax authorities increase the
requirements of disclosing such information in such a way that commercial databases can
include such information, so that the number of potential comparables could be increased.
Thereafter, screening steps with thresholds less than 5% of turnover may be applied.

Furthermore, commercial databases lack information concerning ownership in many cases,
classifying companies as independent when they are not. Therefore, it may be helpful that tax
administrations increase the requirements for disclosing this information in such a way that the
commercial database should integrate such information (e.g. creating in tax return purposes a
classification of companies according to their independence: companies with all shareholders
who are natural persons, companies without controlling shareholders, etc.).

Elucidation on these issues may enhance the number of potential comparable companies.


4.      Determination of and                making       comparability   adjustments       where
        appropriate (Section 5)

In addition to the examples of ratios which are often used for performing comparability
adjustments, it would be helpful to provide examples where such ratios would be applied and
under which circumstances they would apply.

Moreover, it may be helpful to know how to deal with companies with different degree of
comparability within the identified set of comparables resulting from a search process: e.g.
should different ranges be created, should comparability adjustment only be applied to less
comparable companies, etc.

Furthermore, due to the prevalence of working capital adjustments observed, it would be
helpful that tax administrations establish which interest rates should be applied, particularly the
rate or rates to be applied to each component to be adjusted.


5.      Interpretation and use of data collected, determination of the arm's
        length remuneration (Section 6)

As mentioned, the application of the most appropriate method may result in a number of
financial indicators for which the degree of comparability is uncertain. In addition to the
quantitative search process, a detailed comparability review (qualitative search) of the potential
comparable entities have to be performed. Since the data collected exhibit only limited
comparability, statistical techniques are often required by legislation or tax practice in order to
increase the comparability level of the identified comparable companies.

In many cases we have observed that an interquartile range has to be used. As we agreed to
para. 6.2 of this Toolkit, an interquartile range is perhaps the most common statistical technique
used, but many others exist.

We would appreciate further guidance under which circumstances such statistical means should
be used to increase the comparability.

DISCUSSION DRAFT:
A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data
                                                                                Rodl & Partner

With a thorough manual screening (qualitative search) in many cases only a few comparable
entities remain. In this regard the remaining entities already pointing out a high comparability
level whereby an arm's length range could be calculated. Narrowing this range through
statistical methods in form of an interquartile range or in form of percentiles does not seem
from our perspective to be meaningful.

Although, the interquartile range excludes extreme values, the comparability level of identified
entities will not be strengthened. It can be observed that companies fitting best to the tested
party (in the light of comparable functions, comparable risks, comparable products and markets)
could be excluded with this statistical method. In our point of view, the determination of the
interquartile range makes only sense where a large number of comparable companies are
available because of a wide acceptance of differences in the comparability factors.

From our perspective a better approach to increase the comparability level of identified
comparable companies through the use of statistical technique could be in form of a regression
analysis. The regression tests the significance of different influences (e.g. is the stock statistically
significant in respect to the EBIT? Are the costs of employee statistically significant in respect to
the EBIT?). Therefore, the regression can predict if a variable have a strong or weak influence on
another figure (e.g. the stock predicts the rise in EBIT when the stock is increased, etc.).
Furthermore, regression analyses could be applied in early search steps, e.g. testing the
significance of different influences within the quantitative search process. Such statistical
approaches would increase the comparability level in relation to the comparability factors
whereas the interquartile mean tries to increase the comparability by narrowing the results of a
search process.

Showing that differences in some comparability factors statistically do not influence the result
could also increase the number of comparables.


8.      Part Ill: Approaches to applying internatio_nally accepted principles in the
        absence of comparables

1.      Safe harbours, fixed margin and other prescriptive approaches (Section 4)

In general, we see safe harbours as a good approach to determine arm's length prices, if
comparable criteria are available. Nevertheless, from our point of view, there is a risk that in
future only safe harbours will be applied for testing the arm's length principle instead · of
benchmarking analyses or other comparability analyses. Thus, it should be stated that
comparables should have priority. In this context we again want to emphasize the need for
further guidance about noteworthy comparability levels. Otherwise we see the risk that
comparables are generally rejected and safe harbor rules are the only source for arm's-length
testing.




                                                                                                   - 5-

DISCUSSIO N DRA FT:
A Toolkit fo r Addressing Diff icu lties in Accessing Com parables Data
                                                                                                      Rodl & Partner

Ill.       Answers to the questions set out to consider in the invitation to
           commentators

Question 1

We believe that this toolkit generally helps to address the challenges identified by developing
countries.


Question 2

We believe that taxpayer confidentiality may be achieved by means of safe harbour arm's length
ranges which reflect figures extracted information like cost-mark-ups, etc. out of all tax
procedures (big data, e.g. observed achieved mark-ups on costs of certain services).


Question 3

The reliability of potential comparables from other geographical markets may be tested through
an identification of different market comparability factors. In this connection, potential
comparability factors for geographical areas could be for example the gross domestic product,
purchase power, competition, state restrictions, etc. Furthermore, comparability factors
concerning the branches could also be helpful. Therefore, the competitive situation, consumer
vs. B2B, market size, etc. could be relevant factors in order to test the reliability of potential
comparables from other markets. Additional guidance in this respect would increase the
acceptance of studies covering different regions or branches.


Question 5

It is perhaps worth emphasizing to define qualitative comparability factors concerning the
geographical market (as mentioned in our response from question 3). In this connection it
should be prepared a guidance on how to deal with differences within the determined
qualitative comparability factors, including a principle of materiality. On the other side there are
quantitative comparability factors, which can be adjusted with additional guidance (e.g.
comparability adjustments covering country risks in connection with interests, currency, etc.).

Observaciones Genera/es
Consideramos apropiado el balance que se do en la Gui a pr6ctica a las
(Directrices de la OCDE aplicables en materia de precios de transferencia (en
adelante Gufas de PT") y al Manual Pr6ctico de las Naciones Unidas sobre Precios
de Transferencia para Poises en Desarrollo (en adelante "Manual ONU").


Si bien es cierto que no todos los metodos aplican para todas los tipos de
transacciones, consideramos que se est6 dando mucho peso a no aplicaci6n del
Metodo de Partici6n de Utilidades, de forma que pudiera ser considerado como
"el mejor metodo para las autoridades fiscales".


Se hace referencia a que en ocasiones la aplicaci6n de ajustes distorsiona mas el
resultado que el hecho de no utilizarfos, lo cual lleva a incertidumbre en cuanto a
si es apropiado o no su aplicaci6n.


Es cierto como se menciona que en muchos poises se do la pr6ctica de aplicar
los ajustes de cuentas por cobrar, cuentas por pagar, inventarios y propiedod de
planta y equipo de forma meconico y ahorra surge el cuestionamiento de si los
mismos deberfan o no aplicarse o cu6tes yen que casos.


Tornbien lo es el uso de informaci6n de varios onos ode uno solo .


Por otra parte, cuando se aplican los ajustes y se utiliza la tasa prima para el
colculo de los mismos, que tasa utilizar para aplicarlos cuando las comparables
estcn ubicadas en diferentes poises.


Que mercados son similares entre sf para poder recurrir a ellos para la busquedo
de comparables?




                                        178
                                                                         ·- RS~A
Un elemento importante en la busquedo de informaci6n comparable tcrnbien es
la temporalidad, ya que la informaci6n comparable debe ser contempor6nea y
por ejemplo en el caso de contratos comparables para analizar operaciones en
las que se concede la explotaci6n de intangibles vuelve mas complicada la tarea
que ya de sf lo es.


Encontramos en la pr6ctica complicado el hecho de que las empresas
comparables es posible que tengan ingresos por diferentes tipos de actividades y
no necesariamente reportan informoci6n finonciero segmentada por coda sector
y por varios afios y cuando lo hacen lo que segmentan es la informaci6n del
estado de resultados y no del balance.


Dado que los pafses en donde se presenta mayormente la complejidad para
localizar informaci6n comparable, son los poises emergentes en los cuales la
legislaci6n en la materia es reciente, el trabajo de esta gufa favorece adem6s del
tema principal a unificar criterios para el manejo de informaci6n por parte de las
administraciones fiscales, lo cual seria util para unificar criterios por ejemplo en
cuanto a la aplicaci6n de lo que se conoce como el sexto metodo. que no en
todos los poises se aplica de la misma forma y seria adecuado reglamentarlo.


Preguntas a considerar
i,EI borrador de la gu1a practice ayuda efectivamente a resolver los desaf1os
identificados por los poises en desarrollo para encontrar los datos necesarios para
llevar a cabo un analisis de precios de tronsferencia como parte de una auditor1a
fiscal?
Sf , pues presenta los diferentes procesos de selecci6n de comparables de
manera detallada, especificando en coda uno de los procesos la forma mas
eficaz para la determinaci6n y selecci6n de los comparables potenciales, de

                                                                             ·- RS~A
forma que a la hora de realizar los ajustes estos sean los mas adecuados seoun el
caso.


lComo se puede facilitar eficazmente la utilizacion de la informacion
administrativa,   de    manera     que    se     mantenga    la   confidencialidad   del
contribuyente, a nivel nacionol y regional?
Se hace menci6n en la gufo proctico acerca del uso de comparables secretos
por parte de algunas administraciones fiscoles, lo cual deja en inequidad de
circunstancias a los contrtbuyentes pues ellos no tienen acceso a la misma a
menos que ya esten en proceso de una auditorfa, pero podrfa crearse una base
de dotos regional y nacional en la que se agrupara coda empresa de ocueroo a
la actividad poniendo una descripci6n de manera general, y en la que solo
aparezcan los estados financieros sin necesidod de dar a conocer informaci6n
particular como nombre, domicilio o RFC; para ello tendrfa que existir un acuerdo
de confidencialidad med.iante el cual el contribuyente y la autoridod esten de
acuerdo en la protecci6n y la informaci6n a proporcionarse dando certeza al
contribuyente de que su informaci6n se encuentra efectivamente protegida. o
bien como el censo que anteriormente publicaba Estados Unidos en el que
indicaban los rnorcenes por sector de acuerdo con el c6digo SIC.

lComo podria examinarse la fiabilidad de los comparables provenientes de otros
mercados geograficos?
Mediante un onolisis del sector del pafs o la region de la posible comparable
seleccionada y cotejarlo con los estados financieros de las empresas del mismo
giro. para identificar silos resultados reflejan la situaci6n del sector.


lExisten mejores prccftcos u otros enfoques fiables para solventar la ausencia de
comparables no abordados en la guia prdcfico?

Con el uso de informaci6n publico. no necesariamente de base de datos, como
reportes. artfculos o informes financieros, periodfsticos en los que se haga menci6n
sobre los precios de los productos, y que hogan referencia a la fuente de
informaci6n. Tombien existe la informaci6n que generan los sectores industriales,
c6maras y asociaciones la cual es actual y fidedigna.


lQue otros ajustes, y bajo que circunstancias, podrian realizarse para tener en
cuenta las diferencias geograficas? lComo se podria probar la fiabilidad de
dichos ajustes empiricamente?
Ajuste por diferencia entre la lnflaci6n del pafs de las comparables con la
inflaci6n del pafs de la empresa analizada. La fiabilidad vendrfa de los porometros
de inflaci6n de coda pois. que son datos publicos y confiables; llevados a cabo
por los las instituciones bancmias y administraciones gubernamentates.

llos estudios de caso de precios minerales reflejan con exactitud las condiciones
del mercado? lHay otros ajustes que se harian rutinariamente cuando se venden
estos productos minerales?
Sf estcn reflejadas de manera clara las condiciones comerciales def mercado,
puesto que de minerales existen par6metros de referencias internacionales de
donde se obtienen precios para dar cumplimento en cuanto a materia de
precios de trasferencia logrando una mayor transparencia, tornbien mencionan
que las reglas sobre la determinaci6n de los precios de transferencia deben
establecerse claramente y aplicarse de manera eficaz, sobre la base de un buen
conocimiento    del   sector y   aprovechando      las   redes   internacionales   de
intercambio de informaci6n ya consolidadas.

                                Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer
                                Pricing Analysis
                                A Toolkit for Developing Countries ("the Toolkit")


                                We wish to thank the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation for
                                Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, United Nations (UN) and
                                World Bank Group (WBG) for the work done to produce the Toolkit.                 We
                                believe that the toolkit provides a good foundation to assist developing
                                countries in performing a comparable analysis.


                                Comments:
                                Box 9. Country Practices
                                South Africa requests that the explanation of its practice in Box 9 on page 30
                                is amended as it currently does not accurately represent the South African
                                Revenue Services ("SARS") practice. We suggest the following wording:


                                "South Africa always starts with what the taxpayer has done. If SARS does
                                not agree with steps or the results of the benchmarking study performed by
                                the taxpayer, SARS will make adjustments to the taxpayer's benchmarking
                                study. If there is total disagreement with the benchmarking study, then SARS
                                will run its own benchmarking study."


                                                                                                           Page 1of 2
                                                         183
Appendix 6: A selection of other types of classification codes
Appendix 6 highlights that SARS uses the Standard Industrial Classification
codes, with a website link to the SARS Employment Tax Incentive Program.
We wish to point out for transfer pricing purposes, SARS uses both the
Standard     Industrial   Classification   ("SIC")   codes   and   the   Statistical
Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community code,
commonly referred to as the NACE. We would therefore request a correction
to Appendix 6.

INTRODUCTION

1.    The report is well written and provides a number of useful options for developing
      countries to address the lack of comparables, both from a revenue authority as
      well as taxpayer perspective.

2.    Particularly useful are the examples and case studies provided, as well as the
      supporting information set out in the appendices.

3.    The Toolkit was prepared by the Platform for Collaboration on Tax including the
      International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
      Development (OECD), United Nations (UN) and World Bank Group (WBG) to
      assist developing countries applying local transfer pricing rules following the OECD
      Transfer Pricing Guidelines or the UN Transfer Pricing Manual, to overcome or at
      least mitigate problems arising from the lack of suitable local comparables.

4.    Submission: To avoid any misconception, it should be clarified that the OECD
      Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and the UN Transfer Pricing Manual must still be
      adhered to.

SPECIFIC COMMENTS TO QUESTIONS

A.   Does this toolkit effectively help address the challenges identified by
     developing countries in finding the data needed to carry out a transfer pricing
     analysis as part of a tax audit?

5.    Generally, the toolkit seems comprehensive and helpful in addressing challenges
      faced by developing countries relating to the limitation or lack of comparable data
      for conducting benchmarking database searches.

6.    Many revenue authorities in developing countries are still in the process of building
      transfer pricing capacity, and the majority of approaches set out in the toolkit
      requires significant theoretical and practical transfer pricing experience.

7.    In addition, in order to ensure that taxpayers are able to comply with specific
      requirements and/or approaches to be followed where there is a lack of suitable
      comparables in respect of a specific developing country, taxpayers need to be
      provided with consistent clear guidance regarding the approach or approaches
      they need to follow.

8.    Submission: While the tool is very useful, it may not achieve the desired effect
      while revenue authorities do not have the man power and/or skill to implement it,




                                         186
       and until certain and clear guidance regarding what is required from a taxpayer in
       terms of comparables data has been made available.

9.     The Toolkit does not specifically address approaches for benchmarking financial
       transaction such as loans and credit guarantees.

10.    In practice, multinational groups often finance part of their operations in developing
       countries via intra-group financing arrangements. This could be between a
       developed country and a developing country, or between group companies in two
       different developing countries.

11.    In the absence of safe harbour rules, some countries require that the interest rate
       applied in respect of a loan should be benchmarked, while other countries require
       that both the interest rate in respect of a loan, as well as the amount borrowed
       from a related party must be arm's length.

12.    Currently, developing countries often rely on comparables from similar
       geographical markets based on information from databases that can only provide
       limited financial data.

13.    Developing countries often have foreign exchange control rules in place, which
       impact the free outflow of capital. This may result in differences between on-shore
       and off-shore lending rates and guidance regarding the treatment of such
       differences would be helpful.

14.    Submission: More detailed guidance in respect of financial transactions should be
       included in the Toolkit.

B.    How can better use of administrative information, in a way that maintains
      taxpayer confidentiality, be effectively facilitated at a country and regional
      level?

15.    One way to maintain confidentiality of taxpayer information could be to only rely on
       comparable companies which publish financial information in any case.

16.    However, as generally, only public companies and their subsidiaries are required
       to publish financial information, this approach may not be suitable as independent
       companies are often removed during a database search.

17.    Submission: Taxpayer information could be used to set and continuously test safe
       harbour rules. However, secret comparables should only be used in a transparent
       way, and authorities should be cautioned regarding the use thereof.

C.    How could the reliability of potential comparables from other geographic
      markets be tested?




                                          187
18.    It may be challenging to test the reliability of comparables from other geographic
       markets depending on the location of the tested party and the type of transaction
       under review.

19.    One possible solution could be a comparison of the performance of a local
       company (financial information would be available to the local revenue authority)
       with financial performance of a set of representative samples from the other
       geographic market.

20.    For example, the results achieved by a company operating in a Sub-Saharan
       African country, could be compared to comparable East European companies with
       a functionally similar profile on the basis that political and economic circumstances
       in the East European and Sub-Saharan region are similar. In the example,
       information from a global database could be reviewed and filters applied to ensure
       comparability, for example based on industry classification, independence and
       revenue.

21.    If a review of the potentially representative samples in the database, say at least 5
       or 6 positive validations, reveals that the financial performance of the local
       company (tested party) is within the range of the East European comparables,
       then this would suggest that the comparables form the other geographical regions
       are reliable. Of course one would need to consider any adjustments, for example
       for foreign exchange differences.

22.    Submission: It is recommended that revenue authorities should inform taxpayers
       which databases they regard acceptable and if specific search filters should be
       applied.

D.    Are there best practices or other reliable approaches for dealing with a lack of
      comparables not addressed in the discussion draft?

23.    Submission: Instead of focusing on local or regional comparables, a different but
       useful approach could be to focus on regional comparables from a (different)
       region where the economic environment is comparable to the country/region where
       the tested party is based. For example, Eastern European comparables could be
       used to support a tested party in South Africa.

E.    What other adjustments for geographic market differences could be made,
      and in what circumstances? How could the reliability of such adjustments be
      empirically tested?

24.    Making adjustments often requires experience and judgment and this may result in
       subjective outcomes.




                                           188
 25.    Submission: Generally, adjustments should be avoided to not overcomplicate
        matters, particularly if a developing country has not published sufficient reliable
        guidance.

 F.    Do the mineral pricing case studies accurately reflect market trading terms?
       Are there other adjustments that would be routinely made when these mineral
       products are sold?

 26.    The mineral pricing case studies generally reflect market trading terms and they
        are useful to revenue authorities and taxpayers. However, it should also be
        considered that multinational entities may reflect different contracts or processes.

127.    Submission: It should be clarified that the Toolkit is not a complete guide.

 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

 G.    Part I: Introduction

 28.    The Toolkit, on page 6 states that "in many instances, transfer pricing rules
        operate to consider whether a transaction has occurred at all, or has occurred in a
        way that is substantively different from that which is described in contracts or
        documentation".                    ·

 29.    This seems to stress that it should be considered whether a transaction needs to
        be re-characterised.

 30.    Submission: It is submitted that it should be made clear in the Toolkit that re-
        characterisation is a methodology that should only be applied in extreme
        circumstances.

 H.    Formulary apportionment

 31.    The Unitary Taxation/Formulary apportionment approach is briefly discussed on
        page 6.

 32.    It is stated in the Toolkit that formulary apportionment approaches are specifically
        excluded from the discussion in the Toolkit because "they are unlikely to be
        implemented at global level in the foreseeable future".

 33.    However, the document then refers to the re-launch of the common consolidated
        corporate tax base (CCCTB) initiative in Europe, which incorporates "an
        apportionment formula for the purposes of allocating taxing of rights between
        member states".




                                            189
34.     As the Unitary Taxation/Formulary apportionment approach still keeps coming up
        as an alternative method to applying the arm's length principle, the reference in the
        Toolkit may be confusing and send an incorrect message.

35.     Submission: The reference to formulary apportionment should be removed as the
        purpose of the Toolkit is to provide alternative options where suitable local
        comparable data is not available, i.e. specifically where the arm's length principle
        is followed.

I.     Part II: Issues arising when conducting a comparability analysis

1.1.   Expanding existing commercial databases:

36.     While expanding commercial databases to include more companies in developing
        countries is important, this would be a long term process.

37.     In addition, many independent private companies in developing countries, which
        may be suitable comparables for transfer pricing benchmarking purposes, operate
        at a different scale when compared to the members of multinational entities that
        are subject to transfer pricing rules.

38.     Therefore, even if financial information in respect of these companies is included in
        commercial databases, not many may pass qualitative or quantitative filters during
        the database search process and therefore not be helpful.

39.     Submission: Comparables from different geographical regions are useful and the
        importance thereof and guidance on how developing countries should use this
        information, is important and should be emphasised.

1.2    Relevance of the geographic market:

40.     The Toolkit addresses on pages 27 and 28 considerations in respect of the use of
        foreign comparables where sufficient suitable local comparables are not available.

41.     The Toolkit suggests that "in some cases, the geographic market may be less
        relevant than other characteristics, meaning that the most reliable comparables
        available are those from a foreign market".

42.     It is pointed out that while some developing jurisdictions, e.g. in Africa, apply a
        process in practice whereby the focus is on comparable functions, assets and risks
        as opposed to a focus on geographic proximity of comparables, other developing
        countries such as China appear to prefer a focus on regional geographic market.

43.     Submission: Guidance for a coordinated approach regarding the selection of
        comparables would be helpful.




                                           190
1.3   Access to commercial databases:

44.    The suggestions set out in the Toolkit on page 24 are useful and could assist .
       revenue authorities with obtaining access to the relevant commercial databases.
       Existing efforts to bring down costs and to broaden the number of options should
       be supported.

45.    Submission: It should be stated in the document that revenue authorities should
       first review and consider benchmarking studies provided by taxpayers before
       performing their own benchmarking study, unless the taxpayer's documentation
       reflects significant shortcomings. This would simplify the process of a transfer
       pricing review.

1.4   Other sources of information:

46.    The use of secret comparables are addressed on pages 31 and 32. Different
       countries apply different approaches regarding the use of secret com parables.

47.    The UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing and the OECD Transfer Pricing
       Guidelines caution against the use of secret comparables, i.e. the use of
       information collected by tax administrations through tax filings or at customs for
       transfer pricing comparability purposes, "unless requisite information can be
       disclosed to the taxpayers within the limits of domestic confidentiality rules".

48.    However, in practice, it is very difficult for revenue authorities to draw a clear line,
       and that the use of secret comparables by revenue authorities as a risk
       assessment tool often evolves into their use in supporting specific adjustments.

49.    Submission: It is also submitted that the use of secret comparables makes
       resolving double tax cases more difficult under Mutual Agreement Procedure, and
       it is submitted that clarifying this in the Toolkit would be useful.

50.    The Toolkit should make it clear that secret comparables should not be used by
       revenue authorities, even if suitable comparable data is not available, unless they
       are used to establish/confirm a safe harbour rule.

1.5   Working capital adjustments:

51.    Submission: The guidance relating to working capital adjustments is in line with the
       guidance set out in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and is helpful.

1.6   Adjustments other than working capital adjustments:

52.    While the guidance provided in respect of comparability adjustments other than
       working capital adjustments (pages 34 to 45) is useful, the different options of




                                           191
       adjustments and the methodologies available for making these adjustments may
       lead to uncertainty for taxpayers and revenue authorities alike.

53.    This is specifically the case where broad experience and skills are limited within
       the relevant revenue authority. Also, the making of adjustments often requires
       judgment, which may lead to subjective results.

54.    Submission: Adjustments should be avoided, or at least clear guidance should be
       provided by revenue authorities.

J.    Part Ill: Approaches to applying internationally accepted principles in the
      absence of comparables

J.1   Negotiated settlements:

55.    On page 52 of the Toolkit it is mentioned that one of the approaches to mitigate the
       issue of a lack of suitable comparables, particularly where a transfer pricing
       dispute has arisen, is through negotiated settlements between tax authorities and
       taxpayers.

56.    While this is an approach often observed in developing countries, this may create
       several other issues.

57.    Submission: To ensure consistency and to avoid double taxation, negotiations
       should be carried on in terms of a Mutual Agreement Procedure or a bilateral
       Advance Pricing Agreement, or any similar procedure, between a taxpayer and its
       domestic tax authority.

58.    It could be useful to include best practice guidance in the Toolkit regarding
       conducting negotiated settlements.

J.2   Testing the benefits received:

59.    On page 53 of the Toolkit, reference is made to a benefits test for intangibles.
       While the concept of a "benefit requirement" is not new in respect of services
       transactions, this may lead to confusion when considering the arm's length nature
       of a royalty transaction.

60.    In practice it is often difficult to determine the benefits in terms of a related party
       cross-border services transaction, and it could be even more difficult where the
       use of intangible property is concerned.

61.    Submission: The concept of a "benefits test" for intangibles transactions to confirm
       arm's length nature of any transaction is not useful as it complicates things, while
       not alleviating the lack of comparables in developing countries.




                                           192
J.3   Safe harbours:

62.    The Toolkit, on page 54, sets out the benefits of using safe harbour rules and it
       also sets out certain shortcomings and issues.

63.    Safe harbour rules may constitute a simple method to address the lack of suitable
       local comparables, but there are certain limitations such as that unilateral
       application of a safe harbour may result in double taxation, and also that safe
       harbours often mean a deviation from the arm's length principle.

64.    Regular review and update of the safe harbour rule would be important.

65.    Submission: It should be clarified that the seeming recommendation for the use of
       safe harbours must be distinguished from using rules of thumb as set out in
       paragraph 2.9A of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

66.    Thus, it should be clarified that any safe harbour rules should be based on
       comparables, i.e. while simplifying the process, there would still be a reliance on
       comparables, to be determined by the relevant revenue authority.

67.    The process of deriving the safe harbour rate should be transparent.

J.4   Transactional profit split method:

68.    It is stated on page 61 of the Toolkit that "valuable contributions most frequently
       derive from the utilisation of valuable scarce contributions, including those from
       intangibles and from the assumption (including the control and management) of
       the key business risks."

69.    The term "valuable scarce contributions". appears to be new and not generally
       known.

70.    Submission: It would be useful to clarify the meaning, e.g. by giving an example, to
       avoid confusion.

71.    In addition, applying the profit split method still requires the use of comparables. It
       would appear that this method is not suitable where comaprables are in fact not
       available.

J.5   Royalty caps and other anti-avoidance measures:

72.    On page 63 of the Toolkit there is the introduction of a royalty cap, i.e. a top
       limitation of the royalty deductions that may be claimed by the licensee. This
       approach may lead to double taxation unless the relevant other Treaty Country
       applies the same rules. \




                                           193
73.    Furthermore, using a royalty cap approach could mean the end of the
       Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) based residual royalty approaches.

74.    It is pointed out that some developing countries have exchange control restrictions
       in place which may lead to a similar result as royalty caps. However, there have
       been cases where exchange control authorities would consider a higher royalty
       deduction in a developing country on the basis of a transfer pricing study that
       suggests a higher royalty rate than the one set by that country.

75.    Submission: It is submitted that a royalty cap together with the other anti-
       avoidance and tax base protection measures set out on pages 63 and 64, would
       not offer a solution to the lack of suitable comparables that a developing country
       may face, but rather an anti-avoidance mechanism.

K.    Part IV: Summary, conclusions, and recommendations for further work

76.    This section provides a useful brief summary of the Toolkit. The recommendations
       for further work seem appropriate.

CASE STUDIES

77.    The case studies provided are useful and are welcomed.

78.    Submission: It is suggested that more case studies dealing with specific issues
       experienced in developing countries should be included, e.g. management
       services provided to a multinational group entity in a developing country or regional
       distributor/limited risk distributor.

APPENDICES

79.    The information contained in the appendices supports the information in the main
       parts of the Toolkit and appears to be very useful. Some specific comments
       relating to the appendices information is set out below.

L.    Appendix 1 (functional and risk analysis):

80.    The questionnaire provided in this appendix is very detailed and seems to aim to
       address a wide variety of scenarios.

81.    Submission: We suggest that it should be clarified that revenue authorities should
       gain an understanding of the taxpayer's business from the transfer pricing
       documentation provided first, before embarking on a potentially lengthy exercise to
       gather the information as set out in this functional and risk analysis.

    M.    Appendix 20 (Safe harbours)

    82.    The OECD safe harbour for services in the table is reflected as 2% to 5%.

    83.    However, based on the 2005 OECD BEPS Actions 8 to 10 Report, the level is 5%
           (para 7.61 ).

I   84.    Submission: We recommend that the percentage be corrected.

    DISCUSSION DRAFT

    N.    Addressing the information gaps on prices of minerals sold in an intermediate
          form

    85.    Submission: it should be clarified that the Toolkit is not a complete guide and
           multinational entities may reflect different contracts or processes other than those
           set out in the mineral studies.

    86.    Submission: In addition, it would be useful if the case studies would, in addition to
           addressing extraction and refining phases, also include a discussion of other
           phases in the value chain such as exploration, marketing, logistics and restitution.

    87.    The case studies included in the document refer to the application of the
           comparable uncontrolled prices (CUP) method for benchmarking purposes.

    88.    While this is often the most suitable methodology, there may be circumstances
           where suitable CUP method may not be available.

    89.    Submission: It would be useful if this could be clarified in the document and
           guidance/examples should be provided.

DISCUSSION DRAFT: A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data
for Transfer Pricing Analyses (the "Toolkit")



Dear Madam/Sir

The business federation SwissHoldings represents the interests of more than 60 Swiss-based
multinational enterprises from the manufacturing and service sectors (excluding the financial
sector).

SwissHoldings is pleased to provide comments on the draft Toolkit which the Platform for
Collaboration on Tax (the "Platform") released on January 24, 2017.

Our comments to the draft Toolkit are as follows:



General

   1. We support all initiatives that help to avoid tax controversy, as well as to minimize
      compliance burdens for taxpayers.

   2. However, we are concerned that the Toolkit (i) introduces several unclear concepts and
      positions that do not relate to its objectives, and (ii) advocates a number of inappropriate
      positions and Transfer Pricing ("TP") adjustments that are both costly and complex to
      implement, while not necessarily fitting the purpose of the Toolkit. In these regards:

       a) Tax authorities should build on the TP analysis of the taxpayer, rather than (i) trying to
          implement a number of complex and burdensome comparability adjustments (as
          contemplated by the Toolkit) and that neither tax authorities (including the developed
          ones) nor taxpayers wish to undertake these as a "new standard", and /or (ii) performing
          a separate full analysis without consideration for the taxpayer's business model or
          organization.


       b) Delete any references to the application of (i) profit split methods, (ii) (general) anti-
          avoidance regulations or (ii) to the promotion of non-arm's length limitations to the
          deduction of royalty payments.

                                                    sh@swissholdings.ch                   www.swissholdings.ch

SwissHoldings Comments on DRAFT Toolkit                                                              2




    3. We strongly support the comments made on page 52 around using a country's regulatory
       framework to increase the availability of local comparable data. This is fully within the
       capabilities of countries around the world to require the filing of all companies' financial
       returns to a central database. The UK's Company House requirements are an example of
       a potential model.

    4. Further clarifications and /or emphasis on the following topics are required:

        a) Acknowledge from the Toolkit introduction (i) that TP is not an exact science and also
           (ii) that taxpayers are facing the same practical difficulties as tax authorities do.
           Therefore, clear and simple compliance rules are required to avoid tax controversy and
           minimize the compliance burden.

        b) Stronger emphasis to the tax authorities that the taxpayer's TP policy, TP analysis
           applied and documentation package submitted must always be the starting point of any
           review.

        c) Further promote reasonable Safe Harbour rules in compliance with the arm's length
           principle.

        d) Further promote the development of Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") programs and
           in particular leverage on the opportunities resulting from the new international
           transparency standards.

        e) In order to avoid controversy and double taxation, it should be clarified that the use of
           secret data or hindsight (the latter concept being not even covered by the Toolkit) should
           be prohibited for TP adjustments purposes.

       f)   The Toolkit's contents do not fully reflect the latest version of the BEPS outcome (e.g.
            definition of intangibles, valuation techniques, etc.). An update is required.

        g) The Toolkit refers to both OECD and UN Guidelines, however is unclear which
           reference should prevail in situations where their respective approaches might be
           inconsistent. Clarification is required.

        h) Finally, as follow-up work, we strongly recommend to address the practical challenges
           around TP adjustments subsequent to the original transactions (i.e. to ensure that the
           actual profit of the taxpayer for the transaction under review is at the "right" profit level
           at year-end). In this context, clarification, simplification and also alignment from an
           indirect tax and customs perspective is required.

Risk assessment and TP analysis by the tax authorities

   5. We believe the Toolkit does not sufficiently draw the tax authorities' attention to the critical
      importance of first acknowledging the taxpayer's TP policy, transfer pricing analysis
      performed and other available information (e.g. taxpayer's existing APAs in other countries
      for functions /transactions similar to those deployed locally), before undertaking a totally
      different TP analysis and /or a counter benchmarking exercise. The South African approach
      described in Box 8 (page 30) should be recognized as the best practice.

   6. As mentioned above, taxpayers also face the same limitations on comparables data
      availability as tax authorities do. In line with their respective TP policies, many taxpayers
      already have developed a position about the right TP method and best possible benchmark




                                               198
SwissHoldings Comments on DRAFT Toolkit                                                             3



         to be used (with or without comparability adjustments), using the best information available
         at the time the benchmark is performed. Such taxpayer analyses should always be the
         starting point for tax authorities' review, and they should generally be accepted as long as
       · they remain reasonable (being reminded that hindsight data should be disregarded for TP
         adjustment purposes).

    7. With regards to comparability analyses, it is fundamental that tax authorities should in
       principle be prepared to relax the comparability standards where required (in particular, this
       implies accepting foreign comparables with similar market conditions, with or without
       additional country adjustments). In other words, tax authorities should be much more willing
       to accept a practical solution using data that is available rather than seeking "perfect
       comparables" that do not generally exist in the context of an often complex business reality.

    8. If the benchmarking approach used by the taxpayer is reasonable and consistently applied
       (without any indications of "cherry-picking") tax authorities should accept it. Moreover, if
       comparability adjustments (e.g. working capital or country risk adjustments) are not
       performed by the taxpayer (based on judgment that they would not improve the quality of
       the results), this should generally be accepted by the tax authorities. Requiring any
       comparable adjustments as a standard would only increase (i) tax controversy, (ii) the
       complexity of the TP model and (iii) the administrative burden for both the taxpayer and tax
       authorities.

    9. As noted on page 34, too strict independence criteria required by certain countries can
       unnecessarily complicate the search for comparables.


    10. Appendix 15 describes the calculation of the interquartile range. It should be acknowledged
        that there are different acceptable methods of calculating the interquartile range though
        they might show slightly different results. The MS Excel calculation method is only one of
        them.

Relevance of the Toolkit's contents to its purpose

    11. Since the main purpose of the Toolkit is to help tax authorities finding solutions to the lack
        of local comparables, this necessarily implies that the scope of the Toolkit should primarily
        focus on the practical implementation of one-sided authorized TP methods. Therefore:

        a) Any reference to formulary apportionment (page 6) has to be removed from the Toolkit;

        b) Any reference to the profit split method should be removed from the Toolkit. We remind
           the Platform that since 2010 the profit split method is no longer treated as a last resort
           method, and that the mere absence of internal or external comparables cannot justify
           its application. Referring to the profit split (see page 51 for example) as an answer to
           the absence of comparables for one-sided TP methods fully contradicts the "most
           appropriate method" rule.

        c) It would be helpful to clarify that in general profit split is not appropriate for companies
           performing limited /routine functions and bearing limited risk in the context of the group's
           value chain. Moreover, we would like to highlight that proper application of a profit split
           method is a much more complex exercise as compared to the question whether and /or
           how to perform comparability adjustments.

        d) Any proposals to limit the deductibility of royalty payments by applying artificial caps
           have to be removed. This is not in line with the arm's length principle.




                                                199
SwissHoldings Comments on DRAFT Toolkit                                                              4



        e) It is not relevant for the Toolkit to address any (general) anti-avoidance rules. Those
           are aimed at tackling artificial set-ups whose purpose is to avoid tax. Conversely, the
           Toolkit is intended to address difficulties in benchmarking, which is a stage of the TP
           analysis occurring long after having analyzed and confirmed the substance of the
           transaction to be benchmarked. In this regard, the Toolkit does not fit its purpose.

        f)   For the same reasons, Section 3.1 "testing the benefits received" in Part Ill should be
             removed, or alternatively it should be merged into Part II (Section 2 - "delineation of the
             transaction"). Again, it is not at the time of the benchmarking exercise that one should
             address the effective benefit or substance of the transaction.


Safe Harbour rules

    12. We strongly believe that - reasonable - Safe Harbour rules in compliance with the arm's
        length principle are an extremely efficient method to tackle the issue of comparability. The
        risks associated with Safe Harbours are overly emphasized (page 56). We also believe that
        the "most significant benefit" of the Safe Harbour does not accrue to the taxpayer but rather
        to the tax authorities who can have comfort on an arm's length level of return applied without
        having to devote scarce resources to routine cases.

    13. If reasonably applied, Safe Harbours would create a significant win-win situation for both
        taxpayers and tax authorities (this principle also applies to developed countries). Safe
        Harbours can help minimizing tax controversy and compliance burden, and at the same
        time they ensure a reasonable reward and profit allocation for the covered transactions.

    14. By reasonable, we mean having anarm's length" profit level (not too high or too low, ideally
        the median of a reasonable benchmarking study for a transaction type /function within an
        industry sector) with clear and simple compliance rules (e.g. "opt-in" or "opt-out" models,
        etc.). We recommend to set the Safe Harbour profit level for a longer time frame (at least
        over 3 to 5 years, in line with usual durations for APA), rather than adjusting it every year.

    15. In line with the OECD TP Guidelines, a 5% mark-up on costs is a reasonable Safe Harbour
        rate for "routine" service transactions.

    16. Given that the Brazilian transfer pricing rules are generally not considered as compliant
        with the arm's length principle and in practice lead to double taxation issues remained
        unsolved (e.g. tax treaty enforcement issues), we recommend to either specify these issues
        in the Toolkit or completely delete the Brazilian example as not recommendable practice.

Advance Pricing Agreements

    17. The development of APA programs should be promoted by the Toolkit rather than debated
        or even discouraged.

    18. Moreover, considering new tax transparency standards ( e.g. disclosure and exchange of
        rulings/APAs, etc.) available APA data from other jurisdictions is an additional reasonable
        data source to test the TP methodology and profit level of the taxpayer in the respective
        country.

   19. This information could also help tax authorities to efficiently build a database on which they
       could rely to either perform their risk assessment, design Safe Harbour rules, or even
       engage into (APA) negotiations with taxpayers.

Comment to Draft Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing
Analyses

Dear Sirs:

The toolkit is a most relevant and helpful document for transfer pricing practitioners on both sides of
the table. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to comment on the draft version.

We are a provider of comparable data to value intangible assets - in particular trademarks and brands -
which often play a major role in the business structure and transfer pricing of multinationals.
MARKABLES was launched in 2004, and enjoyed great acceptance and success since its inception from
all over the world. As of now we have close to 3,000 registered users. A substantial part of our business
comes from transfer pricing professionals (as far as we can see from their identities), although we do
not focus our marketing activities on this group.

Our comments relate to Appendix 3 of the draft (list on "Examples of commercial databases used for
transfer pricing").

        Appendix 3 lists a data provider lnvotex and its database "Royalty Connection". As far as we can
        tell, this provider ceased to exist back in 2013. We suggest to delete it.
        We appreciate if you list MARKABLES as data provider in this Appendix 3. We provide royalty
        rate and profit split data on trademarks and brands on a worldwide basis.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind regards from Switzerland,

Sub: Comments on a Draft Toolkit Designed to Help Developing Countries Address the Lack of
Comparables for Transfer Pricing Analyses


Dear members of the committee,

I appreciate your initiative of providing a robust instrument for the challenges faced by developing
economies in the transfer pricing area.

As part of the effort to shed light on some practical issues encountered please see the list below.

    1.   Regarding "less rigid independence requirements" we would appreciate your opinion on the
         screening of the management of comparable companies by reference the control dimension of
         definition of related parties.

    2.   Regarding "comparability adjustments" we would appreciate knowing your view on the reliability
         of a fiscal aids difference adjustment and the difficulty of performing such an adjustment.

    3.   Regarding "determining the arm's length range" we would appreciate an explicit number of
         com parables for which an interquartile range can be computed.

    4.   Regarding "determining the arm's length range" we would appreciate a formula for multiple year
         data. In our knowledge there are two methods: (i) weighted average that implies computing the
         average for each company for the period and based on these values computing the interquartile
         range with the formula described also in the toolkit (the number of observations is equal to the
         number of companies) and (ii) pool method that implies computing the interquartile range based
         on each profit level indicator determined for each company in each of the years in the tested
         period (the number of observations is equal to the number of companies multiplied by the
         number of years). The first method provides much smoother results, although the disadvantage
         relies in the fact that it might be influenced by the exchange rate as it is computed as the sum of
         results for the period divided by the sum of the appropriate base indicator.

    5.   Regarding "the choice of the tested party" we would appreciate an opinion on selecting the
         appropriate tested party (i.e. the lender or the borrower) in a intra-group loan transaction taking
         into account the moral hazard and information asymmetry issues.

    6.   Regarding "com parables search process" we would appreciate an example of a screen process for
         financial intra-group transactions.




                                                    205
      7.   Regarding "the arm's length range" we would appreciate an opinion regarding the
           appropriateness of tax adjustments performed by tax authorities both in the case of a
           price/profitability lower than the inter-quartile range as well as higher the inter-quartile range.

 Re: USCIB Comment letter on the Discussion Draft: A Toolkit for Addressing Difficulties in Accessing
 Comparables Data for Transfer Pricing Analysis

 For the attention of the members of the Global Tax Platform,

USCIB1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft toolkit (hereinafter "toolkit" or "discussion
draft"). In our view, an open comment process is an important part of developing helpful guidance that
will meet the needs of both tax administrators and taxpayers.

Our comment includes a letter and an attachment. The letter sets out our overarching comments. The
attachment provides detailed comments on particular paragraphs.

  As a preliminary matter, USCIB recognizes that the drafters face a difficult balancing act. The toolkit is
  intended to provide guidance to developing countries that may be in very different stages of economic
  development. The toolkit therefore needs to focus on general guidance, as opposed to detailed
  prescriptions. In our view, the toolkit strikes an appropriate balance between these two concerns. It
  may also be possible to continue to adjust this balance by adding examples to the case studies as
. countries and taxpayers gain experience with the toolkit and developing countries increase their tax
  administration capacity.

The toolkit also takes a pragmatic approach to resolving transfer pricing questions, which USCIB believes
is very important. This pragmatic approach includes, for example, the need to take into account the
availability of com parables in choosing the most appropriate transfer pricing method. The attachment
points out and supports other instances of this pragmatic approach.

USCIB also believes it is important to clarify the relationship between the OECD Transfer Pricing
Guidelines (hereinafter "OECD TPGs" or "guidelines"), the UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for
Developing Countries (hereinafter "UN TP Manual" or "manual") and the toolkit. If there is a conflict
between the guidelines or the manual and the toolkit, then the guidelines or manual should control and
the toolkit should explicitly state that result. As a product of the Platform of Collaboration on Tax, the
toolkit does not have the same status as either the guidelines or the manual. The OECD TPGs are the

  USCIB promotes open markets, competitiveness and innovation, sustainable development and corporate
responsibility, supported by international engagement and prudent regulation. Its members include top U.S.-based
global companies and professional services firms from every sector of our economy, with operations in every region
of the world. With a unique global network encompassing leading international business organizations, USCIB
provides business views to policy makers and regulatory authorities worldwide, and works to facilitate international
trade and investment.

product of negotiations among governments acting in their official capacity. While the guidelines
represent "soft law", the parties negotiating the guidelines have officially endorsed the guidelines. This
is not true for the toolkit. The UN's Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters
is not an official governmental body and the members of the Committee do not participate in their
official governmental capacity, so the manual is likely even "softer law" than the OECD TPGs. The
drafters of the manual, however, have sought consistency with the OECD TPGs, so to the extent possible
the guidelines and the manual should be interpreted consistently. In any event, the toolkit should not
supersede these documents and the toolkit should make that clear.

USCIB is concerned that the toolkit overemphasizes the application of substance over form principles
and may lead to recharacterization in inappropriate cases. While accurate delineation of the transaction
is a part of every transfer pricing analysis, contracts and agreements are important factors in that
analysis. Adjustments may be made that do not result in changing the character of the entire
transaction. Recharacterization of the entire transaction is inherently subjective and will likely result in
double taxation and disputes. Increasing double taxation and disputes will result in a drag on foreign
direct investment. USCIB is particularly concerned that all three case studies presented in the toolkit
show transactions where recharacterization occurs. In our experience this is not representative. A
better approach to the examples might be to show some transactions that are respected without
adjustment, some that are respected with adjustment and some in which the transaction is
recharacterized.

USCIB is also concerned about the role of and description of profit splits in the toolkit. The toolkit on
multiple occasions states that the profit split method is a method that may be applied in the absence of
comparables. This is misleading, inconsistent with OECD guidance, and may lead to tax authorities
defaulting to the profit split method when its use is not appropriate.

The OECD's recent discussion draft on profit splits discussed the use of the profit split method when
comparables are difficult to find.

           A lack of comparables alone is insufficient to warrant the use of a transactional profit split of
           actual profits under the arm's length principle. In cases where the accurate delineation of the
           actual transaction indicates that one of the parties to the transaction assumes only limited risks,
           but reliable comparables data is scarce, it is likely that a more reliable arm's length outcome can
           be reached through the adjustment (under Step 8 of a typical process for performing a
           comparability analysis in paragraph 3.4) and interpretation (under Step 9 of a typical process for
           performing a comparability analysis in paragraph 3.4) of inexact comparables data rather than
           through the inappropriate application of the transactional profit split method. Using a
           transactional profit split of actual profits in such a case would result in a fundamentally different
           economic outcome to the one supported by the accurate delineation of the actual transaction.2

The quoted language essentially makes the point that it is more important to use the correct method.
Inexact comparables may be adjusted, but using an improper method assigns profits to the incorrect
party.

In addition, even in the case in which the transactional profit split method is the best method and
should be applied, it is likely that comparables will be necessary to its proper application. Under the

2   OECD Public Discussion Draft BEPS Actions 8 -10 Revised Guidance on Profit Splits, paragraph 18.

                                                         2




                                                        208
transactional profit split method, the first step is to assign routine returns to the relevant party based on
the application of one of the one-sided methods. Only the residual profit is then split between the
parties to the transaction. Thus, com parables are usually needed to properly apply the profit split
method. In addition, comparables should be considered in determining the appropriate methodology
used to split the profits between the parties to the transaction.

The transactional profit split method may be the most appropriate method when both parties to the
transaction make unique and valuable contributions. The interpretation of unique and valuable
contributions in the toolkit3 introduces the new notion of "valuable scarce contributions". It is unclear
what the introduction of scarcity adds to the existing unique and valuable contributions. Some
contributions may be scarce (e.g. rare earth minerals) but not unique and are capable of being valued
without reference to the profit split method.

Finally, highly-integrated operations do not mean that a transactional profit split is the best method.4
First, the profit split method is transactional, so parts of the value chain that are not participants in the
relevant transaction are not relevant to determining the division of income between the parties to that
transaction. Second, high-integration does not mean that the contributions are unique and valuable.
For many businesses, high integration is a requirement to remain competitive. Within an integrated
business some entities will perform routine functions for which comparables will be available. Thus,
high-integration is not necessarily an indicator that the transactional profit split method is the most
appropriate method.

  OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation,
Actions 8-10: 2015 Final Reports, page 60 (hereinafter "Actions 8-10 Final Reports") provides that "additional
guidance will be provided on when significant integration of business operations may lead to the conclusion that a
transactional profit split is the most appropriate method." This implies that not all cases of significant integration
should result in the use of the transactional profit split method. Including significant integration as a factor without
that further guidance could be misleading and could result in tax authorities routinely applying the profit split
method, in many cases inappropriately. This is especially problematic given that the one factor that is mentioned in
the Actions 8-10 Final Reports as a possible basis for distinction between cases in which profit split may be
appropriate vs. those is which it is not (sequential vs. parallel integration) has been found to be unhelpful outside of
the area of global trading of financial assets.

           1.    Page 5, second paragraph, the discussion of transfer pricing as a "necessary feature"
                 of co mmercial activities should mention that determining a transfer price is a legal
                 requirement for enterprises engaged in cross-border activities with related parties.
                 It should also note that in many co untries a history of local co untry non-compliance
                 has led to co untries relying on foreign multi-national enterprises for a
                 disproportionate share of their revenue.


           2.    Page 6, first paragraph, over emphasizes the need to recharacterize transactions.
                 Although recharacterization is sometimes appropriate, co nsistent with the OECD
                 guidelines 5, disregarding or recharacterizing the transaction should be limited to
                 exceptional circumstances. Even if the transfer price should be adjusted, the
                 starting point should be the transaction and com parables, even com parables
                 requiring adjustments should not be rejected prematurely.

           3.    Pages 6 and 7, carryover paragraph, the toolkit points out that perfect comparables
                 may only rarely be available, nevertheless, "commonly the data that is available will
                 still allow a reasonably reliable analysis to be performed and a satisfactory
                 approximation of an arm's length outcome to be determined." USCIB agrees with
                 this and believes that this point should be emphasized and moved to the initial
                 discussion (first paragraph of page 6).

           4.     Page 9, section 2.2.1, the second bullet refers to the "wider generation of value by
                · the multinational enterprise". Is this intended to require a value chain analysis is all
                  cases? USCIB believes a value chain analysis is not required in all cases and that the
                  toolkit should make that clear.

           5.    Page 13, Box 2 provides an example of the application of the arm's length principle
                 to a sugar producer. The example might be more helpful if there were additional
                 facts concerning how market prices are to be determined. Is a spot rate used? A
                 weighted or unweighted average?

           6.    Page 14, section 2.4.1 recommends taking practical considerations into account in
                 determining the most appropriate method. USCIB commends this recommendation.

           7.    Page 17, section 2.4.l(e) concerning the transactional profit split method provides
                 that a transactional profit split method may be the most appropriate method where
                 the business operations are highly integrated. USCIB believes this does not
                 represent the most current thinking on the profit split method and therefore this
                 bullet should be deleted. If the relevance of integration is still being debated at the
                 policy level, then the toolkit should not foreclose that discussion.

8.   Page 18, section 2.4.1 co ncerns the application of the most appro priate method.
     The paragraph co ntains a sentence that reads as follows: "Moreover, once a method
     has been determined to be the most appro priate given the nature of the
     transaction, it should not be easily dismissed due to 'imperfect' co m parables." This
     is an extremely important point and should be emphasized more strongly.


9.   Page 15, Cost Plus Method pro vides that "the determination of the appro priate co st
     base will often be of greater importance than the amount of the mark-up,
     particularly where the activities co ncerned are considered to be relatively low value-
     added." Even at low margins, the differences in markups can pro duce significant
     differences in taxable income if the PU base is large. W hile both the co st base and
     the mark-up are important to the determination of the appro priate transfer price,
     the co st base can be more difficult and time-co nsuming to determine than the mark-
     up, particularly in the case of pass-through co sts.


10 . Page 16, second paragraph provides: for a "reseller ... there is normally a stro ng
     correlation ... between the level of sales and ... profitability." This raises two points.
     First, the size of the business is an important factor in selecting cornparables, with
     co m parables from businesses of co mparable size being more reliable. Second,
     co mpensating the distributor for the functions it perfo rms using operating expenses
     as the PU may be more reliable, but the return on sales is often used because the
     co mparables may classify some co sts as COGS rather than as operating expenses
     relative to the tested party (and vice versa) and the differences cannot be reliably
     identified.


11. Page 17 (middle of the page): The transactional pro fit split method is presented as a
     method that can be 'applled in the absence of co mparables. As we point out in our
     co ver letter, the toolkit should note, however, that under the OECD Guidelines the
     profit split method does use comparables to compensate the parties fo r routine
     co ntributions following one of the traditional transaction methods or a transactional
     net margin method. Comparables should also be co nsidered in determining the
     appro priate methodology used to split the residual pro fits between the parties to
     the transaction.


12. Page 20, Box 3: Scenario 1 mentions "a Cost Plus analogue, but applied at the net
     margin level." A mark-up on full co sts is a co mmonly used transfer pricing method,
     so USCIB supports an example illustrating the use of this method. However, the
     reference to the parenthetical quoted above might be confusing to the reader
     because page 16 specifically instructs the reader not to confuse a (full) co st plus with
     the Cost Plus Method.


13 . Page 20, Box 3: The choice of the method and PU in scenarios 1 and 2 seems to be
     artificial. It might help to put some context aro und these choices, for example, by

                                            5

                   bringing the last two bullets in the Box into the description of the scenarios or by
                   moving the caveat in the footnote to the beginning of Box 3. Otherwise this
                   example might be easily misread as providing that in a particular case either option
                   would be acceptable. The operating margins should be more realistic. Using
                   unrealistic margins in examples {even with caveats that the illustrations and case
                   studies used in the toolkit are for illustrative purposes only) may create unrealistic
                   expectations of high returns when those expectations would be misguided.


            14. Page 21, section 2.4.3 seems to be dismissing one-sided methods too forcefully.           If
                   an enterprise assumes economically significant risks, including those associated with
                   a unique and valuable intangible, a one-sided method may still be appropriate, but
                   the other party may be the tested party. The profit-split method should only be
                   used if both parties make unique and valuable contributions to the transaction,
                   including especially the use of unique and valuable intangibles.   All businesses take
                   risks; so, the presence of risk does not mean that co mparables are unavailable and
                   returns may be routine.    Taking on even significant risks is no guarantee of non-
                   routine returns -   most businesses fail.


            15. Page 21, section 2.4.4 again seems to be driving too forcefully in favor of the profit
                   split, even though it acknowledges no hierarchy of methods.


           16. Page 21, section 2.4.4, provides that "a CUP or a one-sided method ... " this suggests
                   that a CUP is not a one-sided method, which of course it is. A better formulation
                   would be "a CUP or other one-sided method." USCIB believes the reference to
                   "highly integrated" should be deleted.


                   As pointed out above,6 Actions 8-10 Final Reports indicates that "additional guidance
                   will be provided on when significant integration of business operations may lead to
                   the conclusion that a transactional profit split is the most appropriate method."
                   Actions 8-10 Final Reports mentioned a possible distinction between sequential and
                   parallel integration as a basis for distinguishing between cases in which a
                   transactional profit split may be appropriate {parallel integration) and not
                   appropriate {sequential integration). The recent discussion draft on profit splits
                   solicited comments on the helpfulness of this distinction. As USCIB understands that
                   the current view is that this possible basis of distinction has not proved helpful.
                   Therefore, there is no current guidance on when integration should be taken into
                   account. In USCIB's view, in the absence of any guidance on when integration
                   should be taken into account, this reference to "highly integrated" should be
                   deleted. High levels of integration are not an indicator of either lack of com parables
                   or non-routine returns and should therefore, in the absence of detailed guidance,
                   not be used to justify the use of profit splits.

   USCIB suggests that the seco nd paragraph in section 2.4.4 be deleted. This does not
   add anything to the guidance provided by the toolkit and co uld be misco nstrued as
   suggesting that the desire to reach a particular profit allocation outco me co uld drive
   the selection of the most appro priate method.


17. Page 22, section 3.2 states that "any source of info rmation should be acceptable, as
   long as leads to reliable financial and business info rmation for the transfer pricing
   analysis." USCIB strongly supports this statement (with the caveat of our previously
   stated objection to secret co mparables). This section also states that there is no
   hierarchy between internal and extern al comparables, but then quotes the OECD
   Guidelines that "intern al com parables may have a more direct and closer
   relationship to the transaction under review". This implies that internal
   com parables, when available, may be better than external co m parables. Similarly,
   internal consistency across similar affi liates is also a strong indicator that the
   transfer pricing method has been appro priately chosen and applied and the toolkit
   co uld address this.


18. In several places, the draft mentions the "supplementary study into mineral product
   pricing" (e.g., botto m of p.24), but we cannot find it in the toolkit.


19. Page 26, Box 4: It might be helpful to note in this example that the return on assets
   might be preferable in this case and that the return on total cost might be
   questionable if the co sts of ingredients for choco late and granola bars are different.
   Either of these methods would be preferable to an inappro priate application of the
   pro fit split method.


20. Page 27 , Box 5 states that Company A posted an operating loss in the relevant
   period. The relevance of this info rmation is unclear. It does not appear to be useful
   in the co mparability analysis because there is no discussion on the treatment of
   losses in the selection of 33 potential co m parables. It may be that the existence of
   the loss was relevant in determining whether Company A was selected for audit. It
   seems that the example is illustrating a case when co ntrol of risk and therefo re
   return to risk is with Company B. The implication being that any losses should be
   born e by Company Band Company A should in all cases have a routine positive
   return on its low risk business. If this is the case, then perhaps that should be
   stated. It might also be useful to show a seco nd year, when the overall business is
   profitable and that using the same transfer pricing method to determine the return
   to Company A would be appro priate in that case.


21. Page 27, the paragraph below Box 5 suggests that foreign com parables can be
   considered when local comparables are scarce or unavailable. USCIB stro ngly
   supports this recommendation.

           22. Page 28, Box 6 mentions "eco nomic conditions" that are similar to those in Country
               X. The term "eco nomic conditions" needs to be elaborated further: e,g, what
               makes Taiwan different from Japan?


           23. Page 29, Box 7 contains a broad helpful definition of market, where the market is
               co nsidered a key comparability factor.


           24. Page 30, Box 8 starts with the discussion of how tax authorities approach the
               taxpayer's benchmarks. But then at the end it states that Colombia always does its
               own functional analysis. This seems to be conflating functional analysis and
               benchmarking where they can be separate: a tax authority can perform its own
               functional analysis and then use the taxpayer's benchmarks if the results of the
               functional analysis are consistent.


           25. Page 31, (2.4.1.1), co ntains paragraphs concerning the use of information in the
               hands of the tax authority and seems to endorse the use of secret co m parables.
               USCIB strongly opposes the use of secret comparables. The last sentence of the first
               paragraph should be the first sentence. That is, the caution in the OECD guidelines
               against the use of secret co m parables should be emphasized and a reference to the
               caution in the guidelines should be included in the toolkit.7 The UN TP Manual,
               while not containing as strong a statement against the use of secret com parables,
               does recommend against the imposition of penalties on taxpayers for failing to
               submit data to which they did not have access.8 This caution should also be included
               in the toolkit.

           26. Page 34, Box 10 states that "the audit team had a number of options ... " but does not
               provide guidance as to which factors might be relevant to evaluate and select the
               best option.

           27. Page 34, the paragraph below Box 10 recognizes that an independent minority
               shareholder may mitigate risks of non-arm's length practices among related entities.
               USCIB supports this pragmatic approach to independence requirements.

           28. Page 38, section 2.5.2.1 talks about working capital adjustments to adjust for
               differences in functions, including holding inventories. The paragraph needs to have
               a stronger statement regarding the need to compare functions because holding (or
               not) of inventory might indicate that one entity is a distributor whereas the other
               one is a sales agent, in which case their revenues will be very different and no
               amount of inventory adjustment will fix this.

29. Page 38, section 2.5.3 discusses solutions to the differences in acco unting
   treatment, including multiple year data. This is an important point, with various
   ways of calculating the results. It would be helpful if this discussion co uld be
   expanded.


30. Page 39, section 2.5.4.1 discusses the reliability of adjustments. The drafters of the
   toolkit should recommend against "black box" adjustments where the adjustment is
   unlikely to withstand challenge.


31. Page 42, Figure 1. The example would be impro ved by the addition of cautionary
   statements that freight rates can vary by pro duct.


32. Page 43, section 2.5.5.1 notes that because of the lack of local comparables foreign
   data is extensively used, but makes no reco mmendation concern ing whether that is
   appro priate and reco mmends further study. Although further study would be
   welcome, in the interim the toolkit should emphasize that: the reliability of
   info rmation is always relative; taxpayers and tax administration must use the
   info rmation that is available; a determination of which info rmation is the best
   available or most appro priate must be made as transfer prices must be determined.


33. Page 45, first paragraph, last sentence: "In situations where   the companies operate
   in a region where not only the economic circumstances, but also the underlying
   credit risk and interest rates are significantly different from the tested party and the
   comparab/es, adjustments for those differences should be considered as well."
   (emphasis added).     What is the relationship between the companies in a region and
   the comparables?

34. Page 45, second paragraph (the WCA) correctly states that following the second
    step, the comparable's revenue and operating profit will increase (relative to the
    result in step 1). The overall result (i.e., after steps 1 and 2), however, depends on
    the ratio of accounts receivable for the comparable and the tested party and on
    which interest rate (A or B) is higher.

35. Page 45, Box 17 needs to define the "geographic market adjustments." For
    example, for Mexico, the benchmark based on U.S. comparables can be unreliable if
    labor/capital intensity of the Mexican operations are different from the U.S.
                    a
    operations, and return on capital benchmark is used.

36. Page 46, section 2.6 includes a statement that it is common to determine a range of
    results and accept results that fall within that range. USCIB strongly supports the
    use of arm's length ranges and the acceptance of results falling within those ranges.

37. Bottom of page 46, the toolkit should define the meaning of the "relatively narrow"
    range.

38. Top of page 47, paragraph 2.6.1, provides: "where the range of results from a set of
    co m parables is wide ... countries may wish to consider introducing a provision ... that
   the highest point in a range may not exceed a percentage (say 25 percent) of the
    lowest point in the range. Where this cap is exceeded, a statistical approach may be
    stipulated." The proposed solution to problem of a wide range of comparables may
    produce results at odds with the arm's length standard. If the range is wide,
    perhaps as an initial matter, the tax authorities should take a seco nd look at the
   functional analysis and determine whether the range can be narrowed by removing
    inexact comparables. Different approaches to introducing a ceiling or floor on a
    range can produce very different results. One could go up 25% from the lower
    point, or down 25% from the upper point which would produce very difference
    results. Using the range in Box 18, 1.2% x {1+25%) = 1.5% while 14.7% x (1-25%) =
   11%. Is this what is intended: two ranges, 1.2% - 1.5% and 11% - 14.7%? If tax
   authorities are going to adopt a ceiling or floor should they be required to apply
   those rules consistently regardless of whether the tax authorities would prefer a
   ceiling or floor in a particular case?

39. Page 47, section 2.6.3 suggests using a lower point in the arm's length range for an
    entity with limited functions). This approach may not achieve arm's length results.
    While in general limited functions may correspond with lower compensation that is
    not always the case. There may be other reasons for the lower returns including
    that the lower end of the range may include companies that are simply less efficient
    than their competitors.

40. Page 48, section 2.6.3.1 the toolkit discusses the use of financial ratios. The
    paragraph suggests that financial ratios "can be used to help distinguish between
    results from transactions with differing degrees of comparability and potentially to
    eliminate those with a lower degree of comparability from the potential comparable
    set." Because the application of financial ratios would help narrow the range and
    eliminate inexact comparables, this step should be taken before applying a ceiling or
    floor and applying a statistical approach. Therefore, it might be appropriate to move
    this paragraph or at least cross-reference the need to apply financial ratios first. The
    paragraph should also elaborate on (i) how to apply the diagnostic ratios, (ii) what
    the difference is between diagnostic ratios and screening that was explained in Box
    7 (point #9), and (iii) what is meant by "refine the arm's length range" (i.e., does this
    mean certain comparables should be removed or does this mean they should be
    adjusted?).

41. Page 49, Box 20 provides an example of a build-up approach. The start of the
    example suggests that only Australia applies a build-up approach. It would be
    helpful to know if other countries use this approach. USCIB supports pragmatic
    solutions to transfer pricing issues. The build-up approach may provide such a
    pragmatic solution in appropriate cases.

         42. Page 51, section 3.1 the final two paragraphs, as written, cast doubt on the reliability
             of co mparability analyses - in particular the language that reads "it is only rarely
             that data is available to provide a well-defined measure of the arm's length price or
             result" -- and seem to sanction departures from the comparables. This should be
             toned down. W hile it is true, that transfe r pricing is an art, not a science,
             co m parables are essential to implementing the arm's length standard and the toolkit
             should not take too negative a tone on the usefulness of co mparables. The choice of
             method and evaluation of com parables is a relative choice and not choosing is not
             an option. Taxpayers and tax authorities often need to use the best available
             co m parables as a better option than using·a different method.

         43. Page 53, section 3.3 the co ntains the following sentence: "Testing the arm's length
             nature of a transaction can be particularly useful where sufficiently reliable
             comparables cannot be found." (Emphasis added.) The meaning of this sentence is
             unclear. It may be attempting to say that the conditions of the transaction must be
             similar to the conditions negotiated between independent parties. This is not
             consistent with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which provide that "the mere
             fact that the transaction may not be seen between independent parties does not
             mean that it should not be recognized."9

         44. Page 53, section 3.3.1 discusses the application of the a "benefits" test to
             intangibles. While section 6.6 of the OECD TPGs10 provides a definition of
             intangibles that looks to whether the "use or transfer (of the intangible) would be
             compensated had it occurred in a transaction between independent parties in
             comparable circumstances", (parenthetical added) the modification of the definition
             was primarily focused on requiring the taxpayer to pay for something of value,
             rather than disallowing a payment. As USCIB understands this revision, the primary
             objective was ensuring taxpayers paid for goodwill. The new "benefits" test may
             create a real conflict between countries that require payments for goodwill and
             other countries that insist there is no benefit from the use of the goodwill, or at least
             no demonstrable benefit. Further, a payment may be required to avoid infringing on
             intellectual property of a third party. If the payor has an infringing product or
             service it developed on its own, it does not "need" the third party's IP, but it must
             pay for that IP to avoid infringing on the other party's IP. In our view, the benefits
             test should be deleted pending further work on the meaning of such a test in the
             context of intangibles.

        45. Page 54, section 3.4 introduces the concepts of safe harbors. USCIB strongly
            supports the use of appropriate safe harbors. We note that the specific limitations
            that define the scope of the safe harbors are extremely important and care should

  Actions 8 - 10 Final Report, page 14 and paragraph 1.122.

   USCIB understands that the updated UN TP Manual will contain a similar definition of "intangibles", although
the updated manual is not finalized.

    be taken in crafting those definitions. Safe harbors help taxpayers (and tax
    authorities) achieve certainty. However, if the scope of the safe harbors is not
    carefully defined, then tax authorities may be dissatisfied with the outcomes,
    potentially undercutting certainty for taxpayers.


46. Middle of page 56, section 3.4.1 describes some of the pitfalls of safe harbors. Many
    of these pitfalls could be avoided if the safe harbors are set bilaterally or among a
    regional group. This co uld be highlighted and a reference to the later discussion on
   the merits of regional international cooperation co uld be added here.


47. Page 59, section 3.4.2:


   The first bullet should also be part of section 3.4.1 (TP safe harbor).
   The benchmarking process mentioned in the seco nd bullet will need to be very
   detailed. Ot herwise a regional search can produce very large sets, which might not
    provide the sort of narrow range that a safe harbor would like to achieve.
    It is not clear what is intended by the fourth bullet. Is this intended to provide for
   self-adjustment?


48. Page 59, section 3.4.3 provides a brief description of prescriptive rules. Some
   additional examples (other than the Brazilian case presented on the next page)
   would be helpful here. Also, prescriptive rules generally are not consistent with the
   arm's length method because they are prescriptive and do not take into account the
   facts of the particular case. The toolkit should note that prescriptive rules may,
   therefore, be inco nsistent with treaty obligations, if the country has agreed to apply
   the arm's length standard in its income tax treaties.


49. Page 61, section 3.5, the seco nd full paragraph overlooks the residual analyses of
   the profit split in which case the comparables may be required and that
   com parables are relevant to the choice of method used to split the profit. As we
   have pointed out above, at this point high-integration is not an appropriate standard
   for determining whether the transactional profit split ought to be applied and the
   lack of comparables is not an appropriate basis for choosing the profit split method.


50. Page 62, section 3.6, with regard to large capital assets, the draft needs to
   emphasize that the value should be arm's length.


51. Page 62, section 3.6 co ncerning valuation techniques provides: "In addition to the
   valuation report, an analysis based on such techniques should therefore also
   consider the basis of the underlying assumptions ... " (emphasis added). The
   valuation report itself should consider the underlying assumptions.

52. Page 63, section 3. 7 discusses anti-avoidance measures. The first paragraph of that
    section states that "the topic of anti-avoidance measures is extremely broad, and

                                         12



                                         218
    thus beyond the sco pe of this toolkit". If that is the case, then section 3. 7 ought to
    be deleted. More specifically, this section suggests capping royalty deductions by
    the ratio of royalties payable to EB ITDA. This suggestion is not really appropriate for
    a toolkit aimed at assessing diffi culties in com parables data for transfer pricing
    analysis and should be deleted. Although this co ncept is somewhat similar to the
    limitation of the interest deduction developed as part of the BEPS project, any cap
    with respect to royalties would need to take into acco unt different co nsiderations.
    Intangibles are not the same as monetary capital. W hile in some senses money is
    fungible, intangibles are not. Different intangibles may support different parts of a
    business and some businesses may be much more intangible intensive than others.
    Further, the interest limitations were developed after a consultative process and the
    2015 Final Report, which was not co mprehensive, ran over 10 0 pages. If a cap
    approach is to be developed for royalties, a thoro ugh analysis of the issues and
    approaches should be developed. In the interim this paragraph should be deleted.
    Finally, with respect to section 3. 7, the discussion of CFC rules is too cursory and
    should be deleted.


53. Page 65, section 4.1, the fourth paragraph discusses some possible appro aches in
    light of the lack of data. In our view, three of the options - benefits tests, profit
    splits, and protective measures - do not really respond to the lack of data. If an
    intangible were found to pro duce a benefit, then the data issue is not addressed. As
   we have noted at several points in this comment letter, profits splits routinely
    require the use of comparables. Protective measures are not sufficiently identified
   to provide solutions.


54. The last paragraph on page 65 should mention ranges.


55. Page 66, section 4.2.2, refers to info rmation contained in tax returns that is normally
    not useable because it is confidential and therefo re cannot be disclosed to another
   taxpayer. USCIB stro ngly supports maintaining taxpayer confidentiality and opposes
   the use of secret co mparables. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines explicitly state
   that tax authorities should disclose such data within the limits of domestic
   confidentiality rules. A cross-reference to this OECD guidance should be included.


56. Page 67, section 4.2.3.3 overlooks (again) the fact that most profit splits will be
   residual profit splits. It is important to note that co mparables will be required to
   determine returns to routine functions and that pro fit splits are only appro priate for
   the non-ro utine returns.


57. Page 69, section 4.3.9 reco mmends "co nsidering the feasibility and the advantages
   and disadvantages of measures designed to protect the tax bases of developing
   countries in cases where there is both a systemic high risk of tax loss and an inability
   to apply transfer pricing measures due to lack of info rmation or gaps in capacity." A
   possible royalties cap is mentioned in this co ntext. Countries are of co urse free to

                                          13




                                         219
      take steps that protect their tax bases especially in the context of systemic high risk.
      Countries should, however, also take care to implement any such measures in ways
      that do not discourage investment and development and therefore ought to engage
      in a consultative process prior to adopting new rules. As discussed in more detail
      above, the royalties cap would raise significant policy and design issues; because
      those issues have not been considered, the reference to a royalties cap should be
      deleted.


58.   Unnumbered page 72, Case study 1, the last bullet provides that A Co: "effectively
      manages inventory, delivery shortfalls, and excesses." More detail is required to
      determine how this is the case, if B Co buys the entire production from A Co under
      the off-take agreement.

      Unnumbered page 74, Case study 1, carryover paragraph recharacterizes the
      transaction and treats the risks that were contractually allocated to A as allocated to
      B. This decision should be explained in more detail. The last paragraph of the case
      study should also contain additional explanation, in particular as to why the TNMM
      method was selected. Further, the example states the analysis focuses on the
      amount of the costs, since this will have a greater influence on the price. As pointed
      out above, the mark-up may be equally important, although the costs may be harder
      to determine. The tax auditor selects B Co as the tested party. "The transactional
      net margin method (TNMM) with (full) costs as the profit level indicator was
      selected as the most appropriate transfer pricing method for the case. In this regard,
      much of the analysis focuses on determining the appropriate cost base in B Co since
      this will have a greater influence on the total transfer price than the markup."
      (Emphasis added.) It is not clear why B Co's appropriate cost base is in question
      since the PLI is based on full costs.

      The drafters of the toolkit should consider including a discussion of pass-through
      costs here. Unless the tax authorities start with a proper functional analysis, pass-through
      costs can distort the determination of the arm's length price. For example, if a foreign
      principal directs the amount, make-up and direction of the local distributor's marketing, the
      foreign principal would control and bear the marketing risk. The marketing costs are pass-
      through costs and are taken into account in setting the transaction price from principal to
      distributor. Unless the fact that marketing risk is borne by the foreign principal (which is
      supported by the functional analysis) is properly taken into account when screening for
      com parables, the set of comparables produced may not be reflective of the function and
      risk profile of the local distributor. That is, looking only at the marketing costs, might lead to
      the conclusion that the distributor is bearing the marketing risk, when that is not the case
      for pass-through costs. The analysis cannot, therefore, start with costs, but must start with
      the functional analysis, so only relevant comparables will be selected.

59. Case study 1 needs to clarify whether or not B Co bears the risk of price fluctuation.
    B Co buys from A Co at one price, and resells to customers at another. Case study 1


                                               14



                                              220
    seems to imply that the price risk is nonexistent because B Co sells to customers
    "immediately" but it would help if this were stated explicitly.


60. Unnumbered page 75, Case study 2, first paragraph under Part B, the last line uses
   the word "recharged" to XYZ {S) is this co rrect?


61. Unnumbered page 76, Case study 2, the paragraphs on delineating the actual
   transaction indicate that the transaction is recharacterized. The example should
   explain the basis for this recharacterization.


62. Case study 3, first page, Part B, last paragraph, third line: "A Co pays the co st of
   refining each bar ... " Should it be that B Co pays the co st since B Co has the refinery?


63. Case study 3, end of Part B, transfer pricing method: "Refined gold is a highly
   co mmoditized product with a highly liquid international market ... [G]old sales are
   judged to be a routine function and should, therefo re, be routinely remunerated
   using the transactional net margin method {TNM M ) with sales as the pro fit level
   indicator ... " Earlier in the case study, however, B Co is said to bear the risk of price
   fluctuation. The case study dismisses this risk by saying that B Co on-sells "as quickly
   as possible." How quickly is quickly? Gold refining is not as simple or fast as the
   case study seems to suggest. For example, EDI Refining states as follows: "Once the
   gold is drawn from the earth, it's still not ready for the market. It must be refined
   and smelted and crafted. This is obviously not something that can be done easily and
   quickly. It takes time and care. If, at any point during this process, a mistake is made,
   then you can expect the price of gold to dro p accordingly. This is further co mplicated
   by the fact that gold is an extremely soft metal that often requires special care; a
   hasty or unexamined refining pro cess can cause issues."
   http://www.edirefining.co m/blog/how-mining-and-refining-can-change-the-price-
   of-gold/ W ith this in mind, a pro fit split between mining and refining might be
   appro priate.


64. Case study 3, Part C appears to be inco mplete.


65. Appendix 1 contains a lengthy questionnaire co vering functional analysis. It would
   be useful to suggest that as an initial matter, the tax authorities look at the material
   they already have in their possession, particularly the master file and local file, to
   enable them to gain an understanding of the taxpayer's business and the
   transactions occurring in their jurisdiction befo re deciding whether and how that
   info rmation needs to be supplemented. It would also be helpful if the draft
   elaborated on how to use the info rmation collected thro ugh the questionnaires.


   Perhaps the risk questionnaire can be modified so that it focuses on identifying the
   eco nomically significant risks first and then go through the more generic checklist.

                                         221
   With respect to intangibles, the questionnaire does not ask questions that go to the
   issue of co ntrol, perhaps such questions could be added.


66. Appendix 7 sets forth possible independence criteria. The appendix refers to "3
   'collective' types" that are excluded without defining what these excluded collective
   types are.


67. Appendix 7, seco nd page, Indicator D: If "D" co mpanies are not selected in the
   search set, this indicator in particular will eliminate privately held companies. So,
   unless there is intent to eliminate privately held companies, in order to include them
   in the set of potential com parables, one would need check the seco nd square from
   the bottom of the BvD Independence Indicator tab whose function is to "Add
   companies for which all shareholders belong to categories "one or more individuals
   or families" or "Employees/Managers/Directors" as well as companies for which all
   shareholders with a stake greater than 25% belong to categories "one or more
   individuals or families" or "Employees/Managers/Directors."

68. Appendix 8, first page, third bullet from the bottom provides: "To have a good
    understanding of the outcome of the benchmark, a rough data dump within the
    database can be made. This number should be in line with the final outcome of the
    benchmark. If there are big deviations, leading to doubts as to the reliability of the
    benchmark, this should be discussed with the taxpayer."

   USCIB has several concerns with the data dump:
      How "rough" should the data dump be? (i.e., at which point in the screening is
      the set sufficiently I/rough"?
   - The benchmark from the final set of selected comparables might not be "in line"
      with the benchmark from the rough data dump if the rough set includes poor
      comparables. The paragraph suggests that the selected set would be
      questionable if the benchmarks don't match, but it can be just the opposite, and
      the final set can be reliable if the rough set contains a lot of noise.
   - Should the rough set should include or exclude loss companies?
      Relying on a rough data dump seems inconsistent with paragraph 1.40 of the
      OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which provides: "Therefore, in no event can
      unadjusted industry average returns themselves establish arm's length prices."
      The last bullet in Appendix 8 may be inconsistent with the OECD Transfer Pricing
      Guidelines. The discussion provides: "Comparability adjustments and diagnostic
      ratios: These adjustments should only be made to increase the comparability
      and the reliability of the data, not to create comparability. Caution is advised
      when using adjustments or diagnostic ratios." Paragraph 1.40 of the OECD
      Transfer Pricing Guidelines provides: "comparability adjustments must be made,
      where possible, to improve the reliability of the comparison."

69. Appendix 8, first page, last bullet co ncern ing loss-making co mparables provides that
    "normally, loss-making co mparables are refused ... " which is true. The draft should
    make a stronger case in support of the loss-making co m parables whose use can be
    quite appro priate if the industry as a-w hole has experienced a downturn lasting
    several years. The decision as to whether to keep or reject the loss com parables
    should be made after the state of the industry has been reviewed.


70. Appendix 8, second page co ncern ing the number of co mparables provides: "If there
    is a small number of co mparables, this may have a stro ng influence on the
   co mparability and the use of a statistical interquartile range."   The meaning of this
   sentence is unclear.


71. Appendix 9 should point out that the calculation of the working capital adjustment
   depends on the PU base. In the current Appendix 9 all ratios are calculated relative
   to sales, which is co rrect for a sales-based PU such as the return on sales. For a PU
   based on total co st ("TC") or on operating expenses (i.e., Berry ratio), the
   co rresponding base should be used to calculate AR, AP, and Inv adjustments: e.g.,
   AAR/TC or AAR/OpEx. This is the appro ach taken by APMA in the APA template file.


72 . Appendix 9, first page, last paragraph needs to be revised because, as written, it is
   confusing.


   The paragraph states that "In the case where the tested party is holding higher
   inventory levels, the co m parables' adjusted inventory will be positive, operating
   expenses will be reduced, and the comparables' operating income will be increased
   to reflect the co mparables' co st savings from holding fewer inventories."


   Comments:
   -   The COGS reflect inventory adjustment, not Op Ex.
   -   The use of the future tense "will be" is co nfusing: will be after adjustment?


73. Appendix 9, second page, last line: the sign in the formula should be "+".

74. Appendix 10, second page, second bullet under "Some observations," in the fourth
    line the phrase "short-term" should be added so the sentence would read as
    follows: "In most cases a short-term commercial loan rate will be appropriate."

75. Appendix 13 contains examples on country risk adjustments. Example 1 involves a
    tested party in country A and a comparable in country B. Country risk in Country A is
    higher than in Country B. The example suggests that the return on assets of tested
    party should be increased by 4%, which is the difference in long-term government
    bond yield between Country A and Country B.

                                         223
    It is not clear why this is an appropriate methodology to adjust for country specific
    risk. There are different types of country specific risks and different methodologies
   that may be used in the event that an adjustment is warranted. If other standards
    may be applicable, the examples should indicate that other calculations may achieve
   a more accurate result. Example 2 raises the same concerns.

76. Appendix 14 needs to have more precise definitions:


    -   ~ARr is calculated for each co mparable. The current Equation 1 refers to plural
        "Comparables".
        In Equation 3, Adjusted Sales/365 should be calculated for each co mparable.
        From the current Equation 3 it is unclear whose adjusted sales should be used
        because the variable is not defined.
        These are calculations intend to show how working a capital adjustment can be
        used as a proxy for country risk adjustment. Presumably, the rationale for this
        approach is that there is an argument that differences in working capital
        employed are a reflection of the differences in eco nomically relevant factors
        such as co untry risk. Do these adjustments effectively result in the replacement
        of the amount of working capital of the tested party with an amount equal to the
        working capital the co mparable. Would this be any different than making capital
        adjustments? If this is the case, the rationale does not support equating working
        capital to adjusting for country risk.


77 . Appendix 15, Step 2, second line should be rewritten as follows: " ... need to replace
   A2:A10 with the actual val1:1es from cell references in your data set."


   The same change should be made in Step 3: "Replace A2:A10 with the actual valses
   fffiffi cell references in your data set."
