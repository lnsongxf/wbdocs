FOCUS NOTE           Vision of the Future:
                     Financial Inclusion 2025

                     I t is 2025. Imagine that everyone around the world is
                       using a broad range of affordable financial services
                     that meet their various needs—full financial inclusion.
                                                                                               importance of financial services for poor people.
                                                                                               As a result, more people are gaining access to
                                                                                               financial services. However, relatively few people
                     This has contributed to a new wave of prosperity that                     in developing countries use these services. This
                     is bringing greater economic and social progress.                         may reflect the perception that financial services
                     Financial services are central to the lives of everyone,                  on offer are of limited value for customers. Low
                     allowing people to participate in the economy, access                     use leads to lower gains for providers, thus putting
                     services, seize opportunities, build resilience, and                      the sustainability of financial inclusion solutions into

                     That’s one scenario; here are a few others.                               Important challenges remain for our industry;

                     1	 There is no universal definition of well-being. In the past decades, concerns have emerged with the fact that income alone as measured by
                        gross domestic product is not a sufficient measure of well-being. In the 1980s, economist Amartya Sen showed that poverty involved a wider
                        range of deprivations in health, education, and living standards. Therefore, the concept of well-being is multidimensional and ranges from
                        civic engagement to housing, from household income to work-life balance, and from skills to health status. Several initiatives, such as Human
                        Development Index, OECD Better Life Index, Multidimensional Poverty Index, Social Progress Index, etc., attempt to measure well-being.

   insufficiently covered by formal arrangements.

       secondary level of education (9 to 12 years). Examples of middle-skilled occupations include clerks, craft and related trades workers, plant
       and machine operators and assemblers, service workers and shop and market sales workers, and skilled agricultural and fishery workers.
    8	 According to ILO, low-skilled occupations require a primary level of education (6 years) or less.
