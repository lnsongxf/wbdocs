            Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
Global Outlook
Despite disappointing growth in 2016, global economic activity is expected to improve slightly in
2017 and beyond, led by a growth recovery in emerging-market and developing economies
(Figure 1.1). Global growth in 2016 was estimated at 2.3 percent, much lower than before, mostly
as a result of slower growth in commodity exporters in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the
Middle East. Low oil prices in particular have badly hurt economic activity in these countries.
Growth in the U.S., Eurozone, China and Japan also remained subdued due to increased policy
uncertainty and slow investment. Global growth is projected to recover modestly to 2.7 percent
in 2017 and reach 2.9 percent in 2019 due to slight improvement in economic activity in major
commodity exporters. Oil prices are still low but have shown some stability around $50 a barrel.
Recessions in Russia and Brazil are expected to bottom out with growth turning positive during
the period of 2017-19. Low commodity prices and accommodating monetary policies are
expected to help growth in commodity importers remain solid.

These growth projections are subject to various risks. Growing policy uncertainty following the
Brexit vote in the UK, a new administration in the U.S., the prospects of rising interest rates and
the upcoming elections in France and elsewhere could cloud the prospects of a rebound in global
growth. Conversely, fiscal stimulus or other growth-enhancing policies in major economies,
particularly the United States, could lead to a better-than-expected global recovery going
forward. Developments in the U.S. economy have significant impacts on the rest of the world
directly, through import demand, and, indirectly through productivity spillovers embedded in
trade. Estimates by the World Bank show that a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. growth could
lift growth in advanced economies by 0.8 percentage points and in the emerging market and
developing countries by 0.6 percentage points after one year. Global growth could increase by
0.7 percentage points. Taking into account these risks, there is a 50 percent probability that
actual global growth in 2017 will be between 2 and 3.2 percent.

Developments in the Oil Market
Oil prices respond to demand, supply and oil inventories, where the latter depend directly on
volatility in the oil market (Devarajan and Mottaghi, 2016a). High levels of inventories will put
downward pressure on oil prices, and unless oil stocks are drawn-down, any potential price
recovery will be capped. This has been the situation in the oil market since June 2014 when prices
dropped by two-thirds, from $140 a barrel to less than $50 currently. In a move to bring demand
and supply into balance, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed
to its first sharp cut in eight years, reducing output by some 1.25 million barrels per day (mbd)
bringing its ceiling to 32.5 mbd, with Saudi Arabia carrying the bulk of the reduction, cutting 680
thousand barrels per day. The production cut was also supported by non-OPEC oil producers
notably Russia bringing total production down by 1.8 mbd from January 1, 2017. While the move
was successful in raising prices for a short time after the announcement, it failed to keep the
momentum. Since late February, prices have struggled to rise above $52 a barrel despite near
full compliance among OPEC and non-OPEC members with their reduced quotas. The main
reason is that the market is going through a fundamental change where US shale producers, and
not OPEC, are the swing producers.

Since early 2017, US shale oil production has been growing at an unprecedented pace, offsetting
the loss of OPEC output in the market. Oil prices above $50 a barrel (breakeven cost) incentivise
US shale oil producers to increase rigs, a proxy for oil activity, and boost output. For example, oil
output from Permian Basin, covering parts of western Texas and southestern New Mexico,
expanded to 53,000 barrels per day in February 2017 and is expected to climb to 70,000 in March.
Moreover, production of Eagle Ford shale is expected to rise significantly by 14,000 barrels in
March bringing total production to 1 million barrels per day. Recent developments in the oil
market have spilled over into the futures market where oil contracts are traded at below $50 a
barrel - $49.25, $49.77 and $50.20 for delivery in April, May and June respectively - suggesting

                                                                                                   2

that a recovery in oil prices beyond $50 a barrel is not expected soon (Figure 1.2). Under these
circumstances and in the absence of a demand shock or drawdown of stocks, the market will
remain supply driven and any attempt to revive prices will be capped, at least until the end of

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook for MENA
Plagued by war, violence and low oil prices, economic activity in the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region remained subdued between 2013 and 2015 at around 2.4 percent on average,
half of the annual growth seen during the 2000s. After 2017, the situation is expected to improve
slightly and growth to surge above 3 percent over the forecast period (Figure 1.3). Though still
below potential, the improvement in growth offers hope. Signs of ”green shoots” are observed
in some countries in the region, particularly Egypt and Iran; a sense of stability in the oil market,
albeit at low prices; and the positive impacts of ongoing peace talks in Syria, Yemen and Libya
could together prompt higher growth in the region going forward. In this environment, the
regional average growth in MENA is estimated to have reached 3.5 percent in 2016. This is about
one percentage point higher than the average growth observed in previous years. Among groups
of countries, we expect growth in developing MENA countries - the main driver of regional

Growth in oil exporters is also estimated to have picked up in 2016 from its low level in the
previous years (See Table 1.1). GCC countries are the only subgroup where growth slid from 3.8
percent in 2015 to 2 percent in 2016 due to austerity measures and oil production cuts
undertaken as part of the reforms to combat low oil prices and the sharp fall in oil revenues (Box
1.1). In 2017, growth in MENA is expected to decline to 2.6 percent as a result of a slowdown in
the economies of oil exporters to 2.4 percent growth, down by 1.1 percentage points from 2016.
The main reason is a likely short-term contraction in Iraq as the country complies with the agreed

OPEC cut of about 180,000 barrels a day. At the same time, growth in Yemen and Libya is
expected to turn positive due to an increase in production in the hydrocarbon sector. Growth in
oil importers is expected to pick up to 3.5 percent in 2017 from 2.9 percent in a year before;
almost all countries in this subgroup will perform better than last year.

Fiscal and current account balances for MENA as a whole are expected to improve significantly
throughout the forecast period (See Figure 1.3, top right panel). MENA countries on average
enjoyed years of fiscal surplus prior to the 2011 Arab Spring and the 2014 sharp drop in oil prices.
In 2010, the total surplus amounted to $110 billion, about the same size as Kuwait’s GDP and
larger than the GDP of Lebanon, Libya and Morocco. This huge amount of savings was spent
mostly on food and fuel subsidies (almost 10 percent of GDP), large public sector wage bill (more
than half of total expenditure in Yemen and Libya); much less was used for capital investment.

The result has been high unemployment particularly among youth and females, a weak private-
sector and business environment, which were factors that led to the 2011 Arab Spring uprising
(Devarajan and Mottaghi, 2015a). The huge fiscal surplus in MENA in 2010 turned into a $285
billion deficit in 2016 which was mainly financed through issuing debt and drawing down
reserves. As countries such as Egypt and several oil exporters are taking necessary reforms (See
Box 1.1), the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow considerably in MENA reaching 1.5 percent of
total GDP in MENA or $52 billion in 2019.

Green shoots are observed in Egypt and Iran. Egypt is implementing key reforms both on the
revenue and expenditure side of the budget, most notably the introduction of the VAT law and
civil service reform law last year; floating the exchange rate; and increasing fuel prices close to
the world price. As a result, foreign direct investment is expected to double in 2017 reaching $5
billion. Growth is expected to remain strong at about 5 percent in 2019. Both fiscal and current
account deficits will improve throughout the forecast period. The large debt to GDP ratio and
high inflation, particularly after floating the exchange rate, remain a concern going forward. Iran
is back in the spotlight after the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action last
year, attracting more foreign direct investment (FDI) mostly in the oil sector. Growth in 2016 is
estimated to have reached 6.4 percent, following a 1.8 percent contraction in the previous year,
resulting from higher growth in the mining and manufacturing, services and agriculture sectors.
Oil exports have increased significantly due to an increase in oil production from 3.2 million
barrels per day in 2015 to 3.7 million in 2016 and an expected 4.2 million in 2017. This is expected
to result in a huge increase in the current account surplus from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015 to 6.5
percent of GDP in 2017. Iran is one of two countries that are expected to register a high current
account surplus in 2017 and the only country with a fiscal deficit of less than 1 percent of GDP in
that year (See Table 1.1). The fiscal deficit is expected to turn into surplus in 2018. Putting all this
together, we expect growth to stay above 4 percent by 2019, higher than other oil exporters in
the region.

Box 1.1 Recent Reforms in GCC Countries
The pace of reforms in GCC countries intensified in 2016 as governments across the sub-region are
treating low oil prices as permanent. Despite the recent agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC members
to cut production and revive prices, oil futures prices for delivery in March point to $53.44 per barrel,
suggesting that oil prices are not expected to rebound any time soon or at least by the end the decade.
The main reason is continued acceleration in U.S. oil drilling which offsets bullish news that OPEC is
complying with the promised cut (See Devarajan and Mottaghi, 2016a).

Recent measures include raising utility rates, fuel prices, and taxes on expatriates, amending labor market
laws, and issuing debt to finance high fiscal deficits. These include:

Financing: Saudi Arabia raised $17.5 billion in an international bond sale and Qatar sold 15 billion QAR
($4.1 billion) in bonds to local debt markets. Bahrain issued $2 billion in international bonds, half in a
sukuk. Oman issued debt in the amount of $5 billion in international bonds. Kuwait expects to raise $8
billion with its first international bond issue.

Taxes: Saudi Arabia removed subsidies and increased fees for government services to issue passports,
driving licenses, car transfers, traffic violations, residence permit renewals for domestic workers;
increased customs duties on 193 commodity products; and plans sugar drink and tobacco taxes for April
2017. New visa fees includes SAR 8,000 (about $2,133) for a two-year multiple entry permit, as well as
reducing the benefits of a SAR 500 (about $1,334) multiple exit/entry visa from 6 to 3 months. The cabinet
approved 5 percent VAT to begin in early 2018. Abu Dhabi introduced a new 3 percent municipality fee
on expat rental contracts. Oman increased the income tax with significant changes applied to small
businesses and visa fees by 50 percent and introduced extra fees for airport departures of about 2 Omani
rials ($5.18). Bahrain increased visa fees and Qatar introduced new fees for alcohol licenses for expats.
In Kuwait, work permit fees were raised from about $6.63 (2 Kuwait dinars) to $165.78 (50 Kuwait dinars)
and its renewal from about $6.63 (2 Kuwait dinars) to $33.16 (10 Kuwait dinars).

Subsidies: Kuwait's Cabinet approved increasing petrol prices by 41 percent for low-octane petrol and
83 percent for low emission petrol starting in September. Qatar increased gasoline prices by 30 percent,
causing a liter of unleaded gas to reach $0.36. Gas prices rose by up to 60 percent in Bahrain, to $1.25
per gallon for regular petrol and $1.60 per gallon for premium fuel. Oman reduced subsidies through
increased gasoline prices by 33 percent for premium fuel and 23 percent for regular fuel. Saudi Arabia
increased prices between 50 percent and 66 percent to SAR 0.75 per liter of octane 91 and SAR 0.90 per
liter of octane 95. The UAE government has taken a different approach from other GCC countries and
floated petrol prices based on global oil prices.

Doing business: UAE’s Cabinet approved a Bankruptcy Law (expected to come into effect Q1, 2017)
pending presidential signature. The law is aimed at safeguarding the rights of creditors and debtors in
insolvency situations, including measures that prioritize secured creditor rights, and enable companies
to restructure without unanimous creditor approval.

While most macroeconomic indicators are expected to improve in the region, people in MENA
have a different perception of their lives. Figure 1.4 depicts responses of people from selected
countries in MENA to the question about how satisfied they are with their lives. The results of
the 2017 Gallup survey show that compared to the pre Arab Spring years, people in Iraq, Yemen
and Syria are suffering most: the dissatisfaction index has increased by 15 percentage points on
average in 2016 compared to 2010. Similarly, in Algeria, Kuwait, UAE, Tunisia, Palestine and
Jordan people feel their quality of life has deteriorated but by a lesser amount than the first group
as they constantly feel the pain of the negative spillovers of war, terrorism and falling
government revenues resulting from low oil prices, on their daily lives. This is reminiscent of the
situation before the Arab Spring, when MENA as a whole was growing rapidly at 5 percent on
average - with growth in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen and Syria even faster - but life satisfaction
indicators were declining, especially in the Arab Spring countries (Devarajan and Ianchovichina,
2017). In the event, people stood up and demonstrated their widespread discontent over
exclusion, lack of voice and freedom, unemployment and poor service quality in a chain of
revolutions during 2010-11. Conversely, dissatisfaction rates have improved slightly among
people in Egypt and Morocco as reforms are taking place.

Risks and Challenges
Risks to the short-term outlook include excess volatility in oil prices, escalation of war and
violence in the region, and uncertainty about the new U.S. administration’s policies towards the
countries in the region. Conversely, positive outcomes of the ongoing peace talks in Syria and to
some extent in Yemen and Libya, and reduction of insurgencies in Iraq could improve short-term
prospects in the region.

Risks to long- term growth in the region are manifold. Conflict and proxy wars, political instability,
corruption and poor governance can have devastating impacts on growth potential. The key
challenges in sustaining high and inclusive growth in the region include ending the armed
conflicts, improving macroeconomic conditions, and undertaking microeconomic reforms to
create a better business climate for the private sector. But more important is maintaining the
political momentum for reforms.

At the same time, the prospects for a growth recovery and even moving to a higher and
sustainable growth path in MENA are significant. First, reforms are a must in both oil exporters
and oil importers. Many governments have already implemented subsidy reforms and taken
austerity measures (See Box 1.1), but additional measures to raise revenue are needed to
preserve macroeconomic stability and strengthen growth. Better policies are needed to foster
private sector investment to complement public sector investment. Reforms oriented to reducing
public-sector employment and narrowing the wage differential between the public and private
sectors would be essential components of the growth strategy. Finally, macroeconomic stability
should be maintained supported by strong fiscal frameworks and clear communication
strategies.

Second, there is a need to revolutionize the education system for better quality and relevant
skills. A reorientation of the region’s education system towards learning skills through vocational
training that are relevant for today's high-tech industry is essential for boosting entrepreneurship
and jobs. For example, technology companies are the most popular private-sector employers for
young nationals, topping the list in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait. Increasing women’s
participation rate for instance through promoting the formal, private sector is important. For
example the Saudi retail sector has been a major focus of jobs for national women.

Third, oil exporters have been growing with oil and slowing with oil. There is a need to boost
growth in the non-oil tradable sector that could help reduce exposure to price volatility and
generate productive, private-sector jobs. Improving the business environment and reducing
trade barriers in the GCC (including in the services sector) is likely to help boost competition.
Privatization may also be important as a way to boost competition given the large role of the
public sector in oil exporters including GCC economies, but it will need to be designed to ensure
adequate post-reform regulation. And finally improving intra-regional trade will be one key to

                                                                                                    9

improving growth prospects as regional integration could open up trade with large, global
markets, such as Europe and Asia, exploit economies of scale in infrastructure, and possibly build
trust among countries in the region, some of whom are engaged in proxy wars.

Just as violence and conflict have contributed to the slow growth in MENA over the past six years,
the prospects of peace in Syria, Yemen and Libya remain one of the keys to resuming growth over
the next decade. But realizing that potential depends crucially on how the post-conflict
reconstruction is conducted. On the one hand, a well-managed process could help these war-
torn countries rebuild their shattered economies and re-integrate their people so that the region
as a whole, and possibly the rest of the world, benefits. On the other hand, a badly managed
process can risk a recurrence of conflict, continued stagnation and suffering, and perpetual
fragility. The economics of post-conflict reconstruction, therefore, is critical to the future of
MENA’s economies, which is why it is the subject of the next chapter.

                         The Economics of
               Post-Conflict Reconstruction in MENA
Introduction

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has known war for centuries. In recent times, the Iran-
Iraq war (1980-88) and the Yemen civil war (1962-70) both lasted eight years; the Lebanese civil
war (1975-90) took longer to subside; and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has flared up, especially
in Gaza, several times. All resulted in a large number of deaths and casualties, and massive
physical damage. Yet, the region’s current civil wars in Syria, Libya, and Yemen1 stand out on a
number of dimensions. First, the wars have had destructive effects on almost all aspects of these
economies. In particular, the oil sector – lifeline of the governments – has seen its infrastructure
destroyed, bringing production down significantly. Violence has created newly vulnerable groups,
such as the unemployed, households headed by women, children born into conflict, and the
disabled. In particular:

 Civil war in Syria has killed about 500,000 people, displaced half the population - one-third of
  them outside the country - and pushed more than two-third of Syrians into poverty. The
  refugee tide, initially contained within the neighboring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey,
  and Iraq, has washed up on European shores, turning into a global displacement crisis.
 The conflict in Yemen has touched every aspect of Yemenis’ lives, limited their access to food,
  water, and health care, deepened poverty, and forced millions of children out of school. More
  than 7,000 people have been killed, and over 31,000 wounded. So far, more than 15 percent
  of Yemenis have been displaced or have fled the country.
 Violence in Libya has displaced one tenth of its 6 million people internally, and about 125,000
  externally, particularly to Europe because of its close proximity.

Secondly, three civil wars are underway simultaneously, directly affecting the lives of more than
60 million people, about one-fifth of the population of the MENA region. They are having spillover
effects on neighboring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey, who are hosting
an unprecedented number of refugees while seeing their trade, tourism, and security
undermined. Terrorist attacks have spread around the globe.

Third, all three civil wars originated with the Arab Spring protests, but have since turned into
sectarian conflict.

 The ongoing conflict in Iraq shares many similar characteristics to these wars, but since it is concentrated in parts
of the country, we do not include it in this list of civil wars.

                                                                                                                    11
                                                               MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR            APRIL 2017
Fourth, the civil wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen have become “proxy wars” where various factions
receive substantial financial and arms assistance from foreign actors and countries. Historically,
proxy wars tend to last longer than other wars, as continued funding stymies efforts at a
negotiated peace settlement.

These differences from previous wars in the region imply that, in addition to being a political and
military challenge, peace and reconstruction in MENA is a huge economic challenge. The scale of
destruction and forgone economic growth - the loss in GDP relative to the “no-war”
counterfactual in Syria alone is estimated at $200-300 billion - means that substantial resources
will be needed for post-conflict reconstruction. The pace and rhythm of these resources will need
to be calibrated with the absorptive capacity of the post-conflict economies. Furthermore, given
that all three countries experienced Arab Spring protests, any post-conflict reconstruction effort
will need to rebuild not just infrastructure but institutions. In particular, the new institutions
should address the sense of exclusion that led to people’s protesting in the first place.

Inasmuch as all three wars have become sectarian conflicts, a post-conflict settlement will
probably involve some autonomy to sub-national regions along sectarian lines. Here, the
distribution of oil revenues across different entities will be critical. Finally, the fact that the wars
have had harmful spillover effects not just on neighboring countries but across the MENA region
and beyond implies that the whole world stands to benefit from a cessation of hostilities in Libya,
Syria and Yemen. Peace in MENA is a global public good. It follows that the global community
needs to come together to help finance, and more importantly to help implement, the post-
conflict reconstruction programs in MENA.

This chapter provides this economic perspective on post-conflict reconstruction in MENA. For
each country, we first describe the pre-conflict economy. Next, drawing on various sources, we
provide estimates of the costs of the war. We start with the human costs, proceed to estimates
of the damage to infrastructure and physical capital (drawing on the United Nations and World
Bank damage and needs assessments), and end with the macroeconomic and sectoral costs. This
synthesis of the damages from the war provide a backdrop to an exposition of the post-conflict
reconstruction strategies. Rather than providing a single number for the financing needed, we
focus on priority areas for reconstruction, instruments, and some principles of a reconstruction
strategy. These principles are important because for the three countries, we will need to rebuild
not just physical capital, but human capital, which has suffered greatly in the conflict; and social
capital or trust among various groups. While the details will be country-specific, the chapter
suggests principles that can guide post-conflict reconstruction in all three countries. In describing
principles governing the role of the international community, the chapter draws on the
experience with other reconstruction efforts, notably that of Iraq after 2003.

Syria
Pre-Conflict (1970-2010)

Syria depicts the characteristics of an oil-based economy, albeit at a smaller GDP than most of
the region’s oil producers. For the four decades before 2011, the economy relied on oil for more
than 50 percent of exports and 35 percent of government revenues. With its oil wealth, the Syrian
government supported the “Arab social contract”, providing citizens with universal subsidies,
public-sector jobs, and free health and education in return for limited voice and accountability.
Periods of oil windfalls brought increases in income, expansion of public-sector jobs, investment
in infrastructure, and improvements in living standards together with advances in health and
education.

Economic growth was strong during this period, averaging around 5.6 percent, with several years
of double-digit rates. Between 2000 and 2008, GDP per capita doubled, reaching $2,806, lower
than other oil-exporting countries except Yemen, but comparable to Morocco and Egypt. The
high growth was accompanied by fiscal stability, low debt (around 20 percent of GDP) and
reasonable levels of foreign reserves. Syria’s fiscal deficit was contained at around 4 percent of
GDP for years prior to 2010. Remittance inflows were on the rise, reaching $2 billion in 2010 from
$135 million in 2002.2

Years of oil boom made it possible to invest significantly in human capital (Figure 2.1). By 2010,
about 92 percent of the population had access to electricity, with 100 percent in urban areas.
About 95 percent of households had access to improved sanitation facilities and life expectancy
stood at 72 years, higher than most countries at this level of per capita income. Health indicators
improved significantly. Immunization coverage reached 84 percent of the population in 2010,
and child mortality was down from 38 per 1,000 births in 1990 to 13 in 2010. Education was
accessible to all school-aged children with the gross enrollment rate in primary education at 126
percent in 2007. Still, the enrollment rate for females was significantly less than for males. Only
58 percent of the female population over 25 years had completed primary education in 2009
compared with 76 percent of males, according to World Bank data. The gap between male and
female educational attainment narrowed for those who completed secondary education.

In addition, Syria is one of the MENA countries that appears to have used public spending
efficiently (Box 2.1). However, the education system in Syria, like those of other MENA countries,
fell short on quality. The results of the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science
Study (TIMSS) show that about half the Syrian students who appeared in the international exam
performed below the lowest international benchmark.

Though high, the oil-driven economic growth of 1970-2010 was extremely volatile, thanks to the
cycles of oil boom and bust during this period (Figure 2.3). Volatility in oil prices led capital
expenditures to rely heavily on oil wealth and in sectors that were not conducive to job creation.
The public sector wage bill and fuel subsidies increased throughout this period in a move to
improve standards of living and reduce the high rates of unemployment resulting from years of
investing in the capital-intensive oil sector.

But the higher standards of living and public-sector jobs raised expectations, leading to a wide
gap between actual market wage rates and expected wages. Those in the labor market queuing
for public sector jobs were faced with a limited number of alternatives and were pushed into the
informal sector. Together with a weak private sector that was not able to create private
employment, this contributed to an official unemployment rate of about 9 percent in 2010, and
unofficially 20 percent, with female rates exceeding 23 percent and the youth unemployment
rate at around 19 percent.

Inflated public sector wages undermined competitiveness in the non-oil sectors. Among them,
agriculture played an important role in terms of contributing to growth —oil and agriculture
accounted for 50 percent of GDP in 2010—and creating jobs especially for rural workers. But due
to the geographical situation of the country which made it prone to droughts, production and
employment in this sector remained low and vulnerable.

Studies have shown that only two MENA governments have used their resource efficiently to provide public
health and education services to their citizens. A study by Mottaghi (2016) uses non-parametric methods
of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate the efficiency of public spending in health and education
in a panel of 170 countries including MENA countries for two periods, 1990-99 and 2000-10. Health output
is measured by life expectancy at birth and education attainment by net primary enrollment, and total
public spending is considered as the input. The study shows that during the period of 2000-10, Syria was
one of only two MENA countries (the other was Lebanon) achieving high efficiency scores in public spending
in health and education spending. Figure 2.2 shows Syria’s estimated efficiency scores in health and
education for life expectancy at birth and net primary enrollment respectively. The estimated efficiency
score for public spending on the health indicator for Syria is on the frontier (red line) and for the education
indicator is very close to the frontier. The results are consistent with high achievement in both educational
attainment and health indicators for Syria during the 2000s.

Domestic economic shocks including the real estate boom and the removal of some subsidies in
2008 led to a sharp increase in the cost of living. House prices soared following speculative land
deals, making it harder for families and young people to afford a house.

Skills mismatch and the disconnect between the labor market and the education system gave rise
to young people looking for jobs elsewhere including street trading, which was considered illegal.
The result was the exclusion of many young Syrians from social and financial services. The
distribution of income widened as individuals above the third decile in the expenditure
distribution benefited proportionally more than the poor from economic growth.3

Between 1997 and 2004, inequality in Syria as measured by the Gini index rose from 0.33 to 0.37.
A UNDP report (2005) showed that the proportion of people whose expenditure was below the
lower national poverty line rose from 30.1 percent to 33 percent between 2004 and 2007,
representing about 6 million people.4 The three-year-long drought devastated agricultural yields
and livelihoods in the northeastern and southern parts of the country, further increasing food
prices and plunging rural workers and their families into hardship. A series of economic reforms
during the 2000s disproportionately empowered those who were close to power including a
number of Alawis, which fueled anger among the Sunni Arab poor (Phillips, 2011).

Syrians, particularly the youth, became increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of their lives. The
average life evaluation index for Syria compiled by Gallup, which measures the quality of life as
perceived by citizens, declined from 5.4 in 2008 to 4.4 (for WP16 index) in 2010 and from 6.4 to

  Poverty in 2004 was more prevalent in rural than in urban areas of Syria (62% in rural areas). The North-Eastern
region (Idleb, Aleppo, Al Raqqa, Deir Ezzor and Hassakeh), had the greatest incidence, depth and severity of poverty.

5.7 during the same period (for WP18 index).5 By 2011, both indices declined sharply to 4 and 5
respectively and continued falling, suggesting deep deterioration in life satisfaction among
Syrians. A combination of the economic and social weaknesses described above including the
erosion of prospects for youth represented by high unemployment rates, and lack of voice
resulting from the exclusion of certain sects, triggered an outbreak of riots in Daraa in early 2011,
which escalated into a widespread civil war.
Civil War (2011-Present)

Six years of war and violence in Syria have torn the social fabric6 of a society that once coexisted
with multiple ethnicities, religions, races, and political orientations.7 Historically, Syria has not
been directly involved in armed conflict except for the Franco-Syrian war in 1920 and the Great
Syrian Revolt of 1925-27. The current war grew out of the unrest of the 2011 Arab Spring.8
Whether Syria’s multiethnic social fabric triggered the current war or the war itself is responsible
for the current sectarian divide (or both) is not clear. But clearly the war is among several factions:
the Syrian Government and its various supporters, a loose alliance of Syrian Arab rebel groups,
the Syrian Democratic Forces, Salafi jihadist groups (including al-Nusra Front) who often co-
operate with the rebels, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or Daesh). Among
opposition groups, Daesh has turned into a major force in the country’s sectarian insurgency,
capturing and controlling swaths of Syria and Iraq – squeezing some of the crude oil production
in both countries. Scarcity of weapons and funds have been fueling additional conflict between
different rebel factions.

   Subjective well-being indicators such as “life satisfaction index” explains the quality of life as expressed by the
citizens. Specifically they answer the following two questions: Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0
at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the
ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you
stand at this time (WP16)? Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The
top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible
life for you. Just your best guess, on which step do you think you will stand in the future, say about five years from
now (WP18)?

  Social fabric refers to how well the members of a society interact with each other. A loose interaction and lack of
trust in state lead to conflicts that pit one group against another.

  Alawi (a sect of Shia Islam, 12 percent of population) government, and the Sunni Muslim majority (64 percent of
population) with opposition groups (rebels) which may partially consist of other religious groups. Non Muslim groups
consist of the Christians (9 percent of population), Druze (3 percent of population), Shia (1 percent of population)
and various others (1 percent of population) and the 10 percent of Syrians who are ethnically Kurdish, though mostly
Sunni, identify primarily with their own ethnic.

  There are perceptions that the Syrian war has turned into a “Proxy war” where the factions receive substantial
support from foreign actors and countries. These factions include Shia Muslim backed by Iran against Sunni’s Syrians
backed by Saudi Arabia. As a result, escalating level of sectarian violence in Syria is linked with the proxy war between
these countries. For example, there are speculations that the rebels continue to be backed by Sunni Arab states such
as Saudi Arabia, and the Alawite dominated government forces are backed by Shia Iran.

Human Costs
Regardless of the nature of the war, the outcome has been one of the worst humanitarian and
economic disasters with large spillovers to the rest of the world. Estimates by the Syrian

Population. The Syrian population has fallen from 21.8 million in 2010 to 18.5 million in 2015 (a
decline of 15 percent), whereas it was expected to reach 25.6 million in 2015 in the absence of
conflict. Relative to the counterfactual, the population has decreased by almost 28 percent. The
unemployment rate is estimated to have risen to 56 percent in 2014, increasing the number of
unemployed to 3.7 million. About 3 million lost their job due to conflict and more are going
jobless as conflict continues. ESCWA forecasts that unemployment increased to 66 percent in
2015 with more people pushed into informal, low-productivity jobs.

The Human Development Index (a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per
capita income indicators, used to rank countries by their level of development) for Syria fell by 2
percent every year during 2010-15, resulting in Syria’s position in the global ranking going from
mid-ranking in 2010 to 134th out of 187 countries in 2015, comparable to Congo, Timor-Leste,
Zambia and Ghana.

Forcibly Displaced. Compared to three million people displaced in Iraq, 2.5 million in Yemen
and 1.3 million in Ukraine, Syrian forced displacement stands out. Over 11.5 million (half of the
pre-conflict Syrian population) have left their homes. Over half of them - about 6.6 million
people - have been displaced within Syria. Globally, Syria stands after Colombia with the largest
number of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The remaining 4.9 million have fled the country
as refugees mostly to nearby countries such as Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Egypt; about
one million have gone to European countries. To keep these figures in perspective, fighting in
Afghanistan has produced 2.7 million refugees, Somalia about 1.1 million, the Lebanese civil war
one million, and the Iran-Iraq war a negligible number.

Children and Education. Syrian children are affected in multiple ways with more than 8 million
witnessing violence, loss of parents, displacement, child labor, forced child marriage and
shortages of schools. The latest official data show that more than 10 percent of girls in Syria are
married before the age of 18 and the conflict has led to a dramatic increase in child marriage
within the Syrian refugees.9 UNICEF estimates that 2.8 million children are out of school with 2.1
million inside Syria and the rest outside of the country. This amounts to half of the school-age
children in Syria. The SCPR projected that the 2015-16 school year will follow suit with half the
children not attending school (Figure 2.4). Among them, one-third did not attend school due to
fear of safety and the difficult security situation. The rest did not attend school due to financial
hardship as a result of child labor and destruction of the educational infrastructure. SCPR
estimated the accumulated cost of loss of years of schooling by children at about $16.5 billion in
2015. The United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF, 2015) reports a loss in human
capital of about $10.5 billion due to loss of education among Syrian children and youth.

SCPR estimates that by 2014, more than 25 percent of all schools in the country (around 5,200
schools) were not operational, 90 percent of which were partially or completely destroyed and
the remainder serving as shelters for IDPs. Official data show that the education sector losses
from the beginning of the crisis until end-2014 amounted to SYP 170 billion, or about $809 million

at the current exchange rate.10 Lack of staff due to staff flight, displacement and migration
besides other violent incidents have adversely contributed to the situation.

A survey by SCPR shows a wide gap in attendance rates between regions. During the 2014-2015
school year, the school-age non-attendance rate was highest in Raqqa and Deir Ezzor where it
reached 95 per cent. This dramatic decrease in school attendance in both cities was a result of a
decision taken by Daesh to close schools in regions under their control. School non-attendance
in Aleppo was around 74 percent, followed by Rural Damascus at 49 percent, and Idleb at 48
percent. The school-age nonattendance rate was relatively low at about zero percent in Tartous,
16 per cent in Damascus.

Health. The health system is completely dysfunctional, with demolition of infrastructure and
medical centers, lack of medical equipment and vaccines, and professional staff fleeing the
country. Vaccination rates for most types of illnesses have dropped to less than 70 percent while
reaching zero percent in some regions (compared with pre-crisis rates of 99-100 percent).
Diseases that were eradicated are coming back. Infant and maternal mortality, which were on a
declining trend pre-crisis (See Figure 2.1), have started to rise, reaching around 23 deaths per
thousand and 63 deaths per hundred thousand births in 2013, from 18 and 52 deaths in 2011
respectively. Provision of health services has taken a significant hit, with 35 percent of public
hospitals functioning partially, while another 22 percent being completely out of service
according to the UNICEF. The collapse of the pharmaceuticals industry has resulted in a scarcity
of medication and the development of a black market, preventing access for treatable and
chronic diseases, especially among the poor.

Women. Women’s role in Syria has shifted dramatically during the war. Data show that 12-17
percent of households in Syria11 and up to one-third of households in refugee-hosting countries12
are now female-headed. This has contributed to deterioration in the living conditions for women
inside and outside of Syria. Data from UNHCR show that half of the registered Syrian refugees
are females of working age. With the scarcity of jobs in the hosting communities particularly
acute for women, the income of the female headed households tends to be below that of male-
headed households.13 Women, in particular poor women and those with disabilities and social

   Actual losses are likely much higher when converting the local currency losses of the early years of the crisis, given
the significant depreciation of the exchange rate of the Syrian pound to the US dollar over the past 5 years.

needs are extremely vulnerable; many have experienced physiological and mental problems.
Access to medical, education and others services is difficult for women given the cultural context
for many Syrian refugees. A study has shown that more than one-third of refugee women are
dealing with disability. They also face various types of legal problems such as family law issues,
accounting for 65 percent of all cases in Jordan, for example. Criminal legal problems accounted
for 15 percent of cases, refugee-related issues 13 percent, and civil issues 7 percent. Marriages
in Syria are not certified by a court, whereas in the host communities such as Jordan, the rule is
different. Syrian females have difficulty proving family relations, which is often a necessary step
to obtain certain kinds of humanitarian relief, causing many to file cases in the host community
family courts. In the case where alimony and child support payments are not made, female-
headed households are more likely to fall into poverty.

Poverty. Unavailability of water supply, poor quality when available, limited access to food,
sanitation, and health care have pushed the majority of people into poverty. Estimates by SCPR
show that the number of people living in poverty has increased to 85.2 percent in 2015 relative
to 83.2 percent in 2014 and 64.8 percent in 2013.14 About 35 percent are living in extreme
poverty (limited access to basic food) though the levels of poverty differs significantly among
governorates and has increased dramatically in conflict zones and besieged areas. As shown in
the poverty map, in 2015 Al-Raqqa was considered the poorest region in Syria with 91.6 percent
of residents living below the overall poverty line. In addition, the highest overall poverty levels
among the population were registered in Idleb, Deir Ezzor, Homs, and rural Damascus (See Map
2.1).

Physical Costs
Assessments of the physical damages to key public and private assets in Syria have been
conducted by the World Bank, SCPR and REACH (IMPACT). The analysis in this section relies on
these assessments.

The World Bank Damage and Needs Assessment (DNA) report in 2014, with a subsequent update
in March 2016, conducted a remote data collecting exercise that combines satellite imagery with
social media to assess damages to the six war-ravaged cities; Aleppo, Dar’a, Hama, Homs, Idlib,
and Latakia and in selected sectors: housing; education; health; water and sanitation; energy;
transportation; and agriculture.15 Damages caused during 2015 and early 2016 were more severe


14
    Poverty estimates are based on national poverty lines and data from the official Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (2009). SCPR projects real private per capita consumption growth in 2010-14 using micro-
simulation, assuming no change in expenditure distribution within each governorate, and taking into consideration
the change in the structure of prices between governorates.
15
   It is worth noting that the assessment is not considered the recovery and reconstruction needs. Since the historical
replacement costs do not take into account inflation, security, insurance premiums, and other market imperfections

                                                                                                                    21
                                                               MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR            APRIL 2017
than previous years and the latest update of the damage assessment has increased relative to
estimates at end of 2014, suggesting that the war intensified in these cities (See Table 2.1 for
breakdown of the damage costs).

Estimates by the World Bank put the cost of damages - at 2007 constant prices - between $5.9
and 7.2 billion as of March 2016. This is a lower-bound estimate since data gathered remotely do
not capture the total physical damages to these cities and the prices used to calculate the
damages are pre-crisis levels that do not take into account inflation, and insurance premiums. If
adjusted by the inflation rate only, damages for six cities over seven sectors for 2016 are
estimated at $33.7 to $41.1 billion for 2016 (Table 2.1). Estimates by the Syrian Ministry of
Petroleum and Mineral Resources put the cost to the oil industry alone at $27 billion from the
destruction of wells, pipelines, and refineries. Putting these all together, damages from war in six
cities among eight sectors including oil, will amount to close to $68 billion as of March 2016. This
figure is close to that of SCPR, who estimate the destruction of physical infrastructure to be about
$67.3 billion including loss of residential and non-residential buildings. Their estimates also
include damages to equipment and tools.

Next, we will look at the World Bank damage assessment calculated at unit cost using pre-crisis
prices, broken down by major cities and sectors in Syria (See Table 2.2). In this report, we have
adjusted the estimates of sectoral damages by inflation rates to provide the current value of the
damages in six cities over seven sectors (See above).


that affect the reconstruction costs in post conflict recovery, the reconstruction needs would be much higher than
the damage costs.

Estimates by the DNA report show that Aleppo appears to be the most affected among the six
cities, accounting for roughly 57 percent of the estimated damages in 2016. Damages have been
increasing since December 2014 (initial estimate) due to considerable increase in
housing destruction.16 Following Aleppo, Homs and Hama are the most affected cities. Housing
is the most affected sector in Homs accounting for almost 83 percent of the damage estimates.

Almost 80 percent of the damages in Hama are in the energy sector. Dar’a and Idlib’s share in
overall estimated damages is low partly due to their smaller size compared to the other cities.
Overall, the two cities account for 2 percent and 6 percent of the total estimated damage cost
respectively. By contrast, Latakia has been a relatively secure area since the beginning of the
conflict, experiencing only very limited destruction.

Agriculture. Agricultural production has dropped significantly during the war, contributing to
rising food prices. Together with the depreciating Syrian Pound, this has made living conditions
hard for those inside the country. Data collected between January and August 2016 by REACH in
Northern Syria show that the median cost of a Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB),
which represents the minimum amount of food and nonfood items needed for a Syrian
household to survive, rose by 37 percent in May. This was largely driven by rising food prices with
the median price of bread in Syrian pounds rising by 38 percent, bulgur by 82 percent, and sugar
by 121 percent over eight months. Cereal production levels have remained low, with an
estimated 2-2.5 million tons of wheat, far below the historical average of about 3.5-4 million tons.
The DNA analysis puts the damages to the agriculture sector in all six cities to around $74 to $91
million. Applying the inflation rate to these estimates will give us a rough estimate of between
$422 and $530 million in damage costs for 2016.

Energy. The destruction or damage to assets have created a severe disruption to the power
sector, which was already inadequate for the peak demand needs of the country. Syria had 7,500
MW of capacity nationwide. The assessment covered energy infrastructure providing
approximately 70 percent of the grid electricity to the six cities. Damages in the energy sector in
the six cities are estimated to be between $1.1 and $1.5 billion in real terms as of March 2016.
Adjusted by inflation, the damage amounts to $6.1 to $8.5 billion. The damage assessment for
the energy sector covers Power Plant, Substation, and Transmission Tower and assesses roughly
60 percent of the installed power generation capacity in the country. Hama is the most affected
city with the largest power plant capacity (1,730MW split between two large plants) of the six
cities.

Housing. The housing sector is the most damaged sector in these six cities. As of March 2016,
an estimated 20 percent of total housing in Aleppo, Dar'a, Hama, Homs, Idlib, has been
completely destroyed. Homs and Idlib have incurred the vast majority of the destroyed units.

     In December 2014, accounted for roughly 40 percent of total damages.

                                                                                                  24

About 34 percent of housing units were partially damaged with Aleppo accounting for the largest
number of partially destroyed housing units. Total damages in the Housing sector in the six cities
are estimated to be around $5 billion, though this may be an underestimate because of the price
quote that has been used for estimation. Adjusting for inflation, in 2016 prices, the damage cost
amounts to $28 billion. The estimated cost only covers physical damage to the core housing
structures and does not include destruction of amenities inside the house and losses resulting
from looting.

Transport. About 2.2 percent of the total length of intra-city roads in the cities of Aleppo, Dar'a,
Hama, Homs, Idlib, and Latakia have been directly damaged. Among them, primary roads and
Trunk roads have been damaged the most. Though the impact on road functionality extends
beyond direct damage to the road itself. Aleppo accounts for the vast majority of the damage
assessed (49.4 percent of the total), and Homs the second largest accounting for 18 percent of
the total. The total damages to roads in the six cities is estimated to be ranging from $127 to
$156 million, covering only physical damage to roads and bridges, and does not include
additional urban infrastructure such as traffic lights, culverts, and road signs. The damage cost
would be much higher adjusting for inflation, leading to an estimate of $725 to $891 million in
2016 prices.

Water and Sanitation (WATSAN). The sector has incurred significant damage. There were
260 WATSAN assets ranging from water tanks, treatment facilities, and dams in the cities of
Aleppo, Dar'a, Hama, Homs, Idlib, and Latakia (the assessment does not cover the damages to
the water pipe network). Of that total, 23.8 percent, mainly the water towers, have suffered
damage. Aleppo and Dar'a suffered the most damage, accounting for 49 percent and 27 percent
of the total damages assessed respectively. Although much of the infrastructure was undamaged,
reduced functionality is a significant problem. Water infrastructure's dependence on electricity
infrastructure has also affected service delivery, particularly in the case of Aleppo where the
Tishreen Dam, which provided 60 percent of Aleppo's power, has reduced the operational times
of pumping stations, and limited household access to both clean water and electricity. The total
cost to the infrastructure element of the WATSAN sector, for all six cities, is estimated to be
between $56 and $69 million. Adjusting for inflation, the damage cost amounts to $320 to $394
million in 2016 prices.

Health and Education Infrastructure. Damages to the health sector include damaged medical
infrastructure, shortage of supplies and medicine, and lack of health professionals. There were
780 health facilities in the cities of Aleppo, Dar'a, Hama, Homs, Idlib, and Latakia, ranging from
hospitals to pharmacies. About 302 or 40 percent have suffered damages or been completely
destroyed. Aleppo suffered the most damage, accounting for 48.4 percent of the total damages
assessed. The total cost to the infrastructure element of the health sector, for all six cities, is


                                                                                                 25
                                                     MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR       APRIL 2017
estimated in real terms in the range of $320 to $390 million at pre-crisis prices. Adjusted by
inflation, the damage cost amounts to $1.8 to $2.2 billion.

The education sector has suffered a major setback and lost much of the remarkable progress it
had made towards almost meeting the 2015 Millennium Development Goal (MDG). There were
1,417 institutions ranging from Pre-K to Universities in the cities of Aleppo, Dar'a, Hama, Homs,
Idlib, and Latakia. About 14.8 percent, particularly the primary and secondary schools, have
suffered damages. Aleppo and Dar'a suffered the most damage, accounting for 46 percent and
45 percent of the total damages assessed respectively. The total cost to the infrastructure
element of the education sector, for all six cities, is estimated to be between $195 to $215 million,
as of March 2016 estimated at pre-crisis 2007 prices and do not take into account the rising
inflation in the aftermath of the war. At current 2016 prices, the World Bank estimates the
damage cost to the infrastructure of the education sector to be in the range of $1.1 to $1.2 billion.

Economic Costs
Economic activity in all sectors of the economy (except the military) have slowed down or stalled
as a result of war and violence. For ease of analysis, we will first discuss the macroeconomic
impact of the war on the Syrian economy over the past 6 years. Next, we will provide estimates
of sectoral damages from the World Bank, UNOSAT and SCPR to show the severity of damages.

Macroeconomic. The protracted Syrian war has damaged the structure of the economy,
diverting resources from productive sectors to fighting conflict across the country. Economic

instability, violence and lack of security have created multiple groups, each governing a region or
sub-region. Job opportunities are available only in conflict-related areas. Trade has been
disrupted and is mostly informal. Under these circumstances, economic activity has fallen.
Compared to the GDP levels in 2010 (prior to conflict), Syria’s GDP fell by 16 percentage points
on average each year during the period of 2011-14. The World Bank estimated that growth was
expected to contract by another 16 percent in 2015 and 4 percent in 2016. Collier (1999)
estimates that countries annual real GDP growth tends to slow down by more than two
percentage points on average during civil conflict; Syria’s growth fell by over five times that
amount. The decline in average annual per-capita income in Syria has been about two percentage
points larger than those for a sample of more than a dozen fragile countries (Stewart et al., 2001).

The dramatic decline in the size and skills of the labor force due to loss of life, disability and
displacement has been a major source of output loss. According to Ianchovichina and Ivanic
(2016), death and forced displacement accounted for one-fifth of the decline in Syrian economic
output during the first three years of the war, while capital destruction contributed close to a
quarter.

Syria’s non-oil GDP declined by an annual rate of 15.5 percent for 2011-14 and was estimated to
decline further by 4.9 and 4.3 percent over 2015-16 respectively. Cumulative output in constant
prices is estimated to have declined by two-thirds between 2010 and 2016. The estimated
foregone output (output if there were no conflict and the economy grew by 5 percent annually,
on average) amounts to 300 percent of 2010 GDP in constant prices (Figure 2.5). Oil production,
the main source of government revenue and exports, has come to a virtual halt due to conflict
and Daesh control. Prior to the conflict, the country produced 368,000 barrels of oil per day and
exported half of this amount, mainly to Europe. Oil production has dipped to less than 40,000
barrels in 2016 due to damages to facilities and pipelines, and international sanctions imposed
on Syria in late 2011 (See Figure 2.5).

The 2011 international sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union, the League
of Arab States and some other countries banning oil imports from Syria, freezing government and
individual assets and termination of investment by Arab governments have contributed to the
massive loss in output. Qatar, for example is estimated to have halted $6 billion in investment in
the country. The banning of Syrian oil imports has forced the State Oil Company to find new
markets elsewhere but with no success. Some of its oil buyers including Indian refineries were
not been able to secure private or public insurance for shipments. Sanctions on Syrian oil are
estimated to have cost the government $4 billion in lost revenues, leading to a severe foreign
currency crisis.17 To counter the impact of the trade losses on the economy, Syria has largely

relied on Iran, Iraq, and Russia and to some extent Turkey and Jordan. Iraq, ignoring the Arab
League sanctions, increased its imports from Syria by 40 percent, and Iran increased its imports
by 100 percent.

Moreover, the total costs of war in terms of economic output would nearly double if the
opportunity cost of the forgone deep trade integration reforms within the “Levant Quartet”18
were included in the estimation (Ianchovichina and Ivanic, 2016). These reforms would have
allowed Syria to modernize its economy by improving firms’ competitiveness and diversifying
production. Although Syria continued to trade with its neighbors after 2011, the composition of
trade changed considerably, from capital goods such as machinery and equipment to necessities
and other goods in short supply.

  The negotiations of a regional trade agreement among Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon (the “Levant Quartet”)
were advanced in 2010, as reflected in the Joint Declaration on Establishing Closer Neighbors Economic and Trade
Association (CNETAC) signed in July 2010 (World Bank, 2014, Aydin and Yanar, 2011).

                                                                                                                     28

Due to violence and the government’s large military expenses, capital expenditures have fallen
rapidly, to about half a percentage point of GDP in 2016, compared to 9 percent of GDP in 2010,
while current expenditure has increased by 6 percentage points of GDP in 2016 compared to
2010. With almost zero oil revenues, the huge fiscal and current account deficits have been
financed by printing money and using foreign reserves. Total foreign reserves are estimated to
have reached below $1 billion in 2016 from $20 billion in 2010. The Syrian Pound has depreciated
by 400 percent, with the official rate at 514.43 per US dollar on March 10, 2017. The current
account balance has deteriorated mainly due to a sharp decline in tourism and oil exports. Lines
of credit from Iran and assistance from Russia have helped government finances, but aggravated
the already high public debt, which doubled during 2011-14. The IMF estimates that public debt
stands at 100 percent of GDP in 2015, up from 31 percent of GDP in 2009.

Infrastructure. Sectoral output losses and infrastructure destruction are significant. They are
mainly in the construction (housing) sector followed by manufacturing, and mining especially oil
(See next section). A large number of housing units have been destroyed or damaged, putting
pressure on the existing houses in the cities not directly involved in war.

The manufacturing hubs of Aleppo, Homs, and the suburbs of Damascus have been destroyed by
intense fighting. Furthermore, this sector has been suffering from shortages in fuel, electricity
and raw materials due to lower imports. Since 2010, pharmaceutical production has declined by
90 percent according to the UN. The agriculture sector has been affected largely by shortages of
inputs, equipment and storage problems and this has been exacerbated by low precipitation
rates recorded in 2014. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), wheat production has been halved in 2014 compared to mid-2000. The damage to
irrigation infrastructure has led to increased reliance on rain-fed crops.

Costs of Rebuilding the Syrian Economy
Estimates of output and growth for 2017 and beyond are difficult due to lack of reliable data
particularly on damages to the infrastructure, currency depreciation and fiscal-deficit financing
in the face of dwindling reserves. The destruction of health and education services, and
displacement of highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs fleeing the country have also affected
the labor market. Moreover, the current low school enrollment rate of children and their
deteriorating health conditions will negatively impact the country’s potential output f or years to
come. Estimates by the World Bank show that if a political solution is reached today and
reconstruction begins, it will take 10 years for the Syrian GDP to get close to its pre-war (2010)
real GDP level, if the economy grows by 5 percent on average. Growing at lower than this rate
i.e. at 3 percent growth rate, will delay the recovery by another 10 years.

Recovery and faster growth will also depend on the reconstruction strategy, implementation and
the resources available from the international community. Furthermore, studies have shown that
the pace of economic recovery in the medium term depends to some extent on whether a
country is rich in natural resources (Devarajan and Mottaghi, 2016b). This is because oil output
could recover faster than others sectors in oil rich countries compared to other sectors of the
economy. A peace settlement in Syria could lead to a swift rebound in oil output and exports,
allowing the economy to recover more quickly.
Rebuilding Human Capital
The post-conflict Syrian economy will inherit a weak labor market, disrupted education system
and patchy human capital characterized by shortages of skilled workers, teachers, professionals,
physicians, etc. that have either fled the country or been displaced internally. Motivating the
displaced and refugees to return and, more important, creating jobs for those that have been out
of the labor market for several years is a daunting task. Vast amount of resources and sustainable
policies are needed to encourage displaced people to return and to help them reintegrate into
the society. This is challenging both for the post-conflict government and the international
community as some of the refugees particularly the skilled workers, may choose to stay in hosting
communities due to insecurity and lack of access to basic services and jobs in their homeland.19
For example, in post-war Bosnia, many refugees did not return to their home community due to
lack of employment opportunities. Contrary to the refugees who have fled the country, IDPs are
more likely to return, providing appropriate reintegration support for their smooth transition.

There are many obstacles that stand in the way of reintegrating of returnees into the society.
Returnees often choose not to return to their pre-war living communities for fear of
discrimination, violence or lack of economic opportunities. This could also apply to those IDPs
who select not to go back to their former communities in their homeland and choose different
areas to live. This could increase competition in finding jobs, schooling and health care services
in the areas that are overly demanded. A recent study by the World Bank examines what can be
learned from the available literature and the case studies about the when, who, and why of
return, and the role of international assistance in the eight case studies. The study finds that most
returnees to their home countries will not go back to their original villages and hometowns.
Instead, they settle in the capital where they can find more economic and educational
opportunities. For example, during the civil war in southern Sudan between 1983 and 2005, more
than two million people predominantly from rural areas fled to Khartoum. While half have
remained in Khartoum, many of those that returned (along with IDPs) have moved to Juba and

  Studies have shown that average number of years for refugees in exile to return after a peace deal is about 17
years.

other towns in what is now South Sudan rather than to their rural areas of origin, due to better
security, services, and economic opportunities.

What can be done for a smooth reintegration of the Syrian returnees into the labor market? The
answer depends on two factors; how fast the education system can respond to the need for
rebuilding human capital in Syria, and how to fill the skill gap between schooling and the labor
market? First, due to the mass destruction of the education system, there is an urgent need to
form medium-term programs to support educational services for Syrians. Returnees and
displaced people need to acquire new skills that are needed to land a job and this could be done
through re-evaluating and revitalizing the education and training system. Studies have shown
that in countries affected by violence, local education institutions are not capable of providing
quality education to the population immediately after a peace settlement. So it is crucial to focus
on short-term interventions perhaps through private or international development partners
including universities to help restore the education system. This could start now while peace talks
are underway. In the medium to long term, however, it is imperative to move from short term
interventions to re-build physical infrastructure and institutional capacity aimed at re-orienting
the education system towards learning skills and vocational training.

Second, social capital and relationships of trust play an important role in the reintegration
process. Studies have shown that communities with a good stock of social capital have less crime,
better health and higher educational achievement (Halpern 2009). There is, however, a downside
to this and that is when groups and organizations with high social capital have the means to
exclude others. A survey conducted by UNHCR in the Afghan labor market in 2006 showed that
networking played a strong role in integration of returnees into the labor market through
personal networks of friends and relatives as well as professional networks in their field to get
information about jobs or to get a job directly. The results also show that attractive sectors for
job creation were those that needed less skills such as construction, wholesale, retail and
manufacturing where they could easily find a job.

Yemen
Pre-Conflict (1970-2010)

Yemen, an oil-based economy, supported the same “Arab social contract” as the rest of the
countries in the MENA region. For the past three decades, Yemen has relied on oil for more than
one third of its GDP ($31 billion in 2010), half of government revenues and 90 percent of its
exports. For years, particularly during the high oil prices of the 2000s, the government enjoyed
more than $3 billion oil revenues annually, allowing it to support a large public sector and
investment in infrastructure. Oil resources remained the main driver of growth, shaping the long
term economic trajectory of the country. Growth was high but volatile, reaching 7.7 percent in
2010 (due to the gas liquefaction investment). Average growth for the period of 1970 – 2010 was

a reasonable 3.8 percent (Figure 2.6). Despite such high growth, GDP per capita in Yemen
remained the lowest among all countries in MENA, due to a high fertility rate of about 5.4
children born per woman and population growth rate above 3 percent.

Despite improvements in education and health indicators, poverty remained high. The
percentage of people living below the poverty line of $1.9 per day (PPP) increased from 44.9
percent in 1990 to 46 percent in 2010. At $4 a day (PPP) more than 85 percent of people lived
below the poverty line in 2010. Yemen also had one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world,
with almost 60 percent of children under the age of five having chronic malnutrition, 35 percent
underweight, and 13 percent having acute malnutrition in 2012.

There are multiple reasons for the high poverty rate including water shortages that reduced
availability of agricultural products, the inflated public sector that has reduced job opportunities
elsewhere, and mismanagement of economic policy. For example, Qat plantation represents
about 30 percent of the agricultural production but half of the employed adult males working in

                                                                                                                                                                                            32
                                                                                                           MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR                             APRIL 2017
the sector grow Qat, a low level drug-like leaf that consumes water and is estimated to be six
times more profitable than other food crops, while the country imported over 90 percent of its
food. Studies have shown that Yemenis spend one-quarter of their income on Qat, more than
they do on food. Spikes in food prices during this period exacerbated the situation, throwing large
numbers of Yemenis into poverty. About one million were hired in the public sector and between
8 to 10 percent of them worked mostly as “ghost employees” who were salary earners but either
did not exist or were listed on the payroll of other services, cashing in two or three salaries plus
benefits. Government wages and salaries remained a burden on expenses, reaching 11 percent
of GDP in 2009. Subsidies also constituted a big share of government expenses, standing at 14
percent of GDP in 2008.

A number of factors led to the 2011 uprising in Yemen, alongside other Arab Spring countries. A
broken social contract, low levels of education, with approximately half of the youth illiterate and
even those with university degrees lacking skills to be absorbed in the labor market, resulted in
an ongoing youth unemployment crisis (standing at an estimated 60 percent). The drop in oil
prices after 2009 that led the government to rethink its obligations towards expanding public-
sector jobs; lack of voice and accountability; low quality of social services; high rates of poverty
and malnourished people; all in a multi-sect, tribal society, triggered the protests in 2011. The
long-serving President, Ali Abdallah Saleh, was removed from office. A process of national
dialogue to write a new constitution was established. A few months after the national dialogue
concluded, a group led by the Houthis, who were not part of the national dialogue, rebelled. The
civil war that started in March 2015 is sometimes called a proxy war because it consists of military
operations by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia battling the Houthis, who are thought to be
supported by Iran. Now in its second year, the civil war has produced the worst humanitarian
crisis in the history of Yemen.

Civil War (2015-Present)

Human Costs

Social indicators in Yemen were weak before 2015, but the escalation of conflict has destroyed
progress made in the past two decades. The 2015 Human Development report ranks Yemen 160th
among 188 countries, a setback from 154th rank in 2014. The effect of the conflict has been
catastrophic to the Yemeni people. The civilian death toll is estimated to have exceeded 6,000,
with about 28,500 wounded. As of end 2015, 2.5 million people were estimated to be internally
displaced in Yemen. The poor are suffering the most: 21.2 million Yemenis or more than 80
percent of the population are in need of emergency humanitarian assistance; 14.4 million
Yemenis are facing chronic food insecurity, an increase of 35 percent since the conflict began;
and 19.3 million Yemenis are without safe drinking water or sanitation. According to UNOCHA,



                                                                                                 33
                                                     MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR       APRIL 2017
this has led to a sharp increase in malnutrition and disease burden as reliance on water from
unprotected sources makes people, particularly the young, vulnerable to diseases.

Children. Continued violence has taken a toll on Yemeni children. Data gathered by UNICEF show
that six children have been killed or injured every day since March 2015, a sevenfold increase
compared with 2014. Combatant parties have also recruited children to join the fighting. In 2015,
the United Nations documented 848 cases of child recruitment, with reports suggesting that
children as young as 10 were pulled into battle. There are estimates that about 3,600 schools
have closed, bringing the total school-age population that is out of school to more than 3.4
million, or half of all school-aged children in the country. At least 51 attacks on education facilities
in Yemen have also been verified.
Physical Costs
The civil war in Yemen is still ongoing and therefore estimates of the costs of damage to
infrastructure, physical capital and human capital are incomplete. A joint study by the World
Bank, United Nations, Islamic Development Bank and European Union put an early estimate of
damage costs (still partial and incomplete) of $15 billion, consisting of almost $7 billion in
economic losses (in nominal terms) and over $7.3 billion in production and service delivery. The
cost estimates assess residential damage only in the cities of Sanaa, Aden, Taiz and Zinjibar, to
be about $3.6 billion but data collection was cut off in October 2015 -- about seven months into
the conflict. The cost to reconstruct damaged energy facilities in the four cities was an estimated
$139 million, most going to repairing damaged or destroyed power plants. A survey by Yemen's
education ministry showed that of 1,671 schools in 20 governorates that suffered damage, 287
need major reconstruction, 544 were serving as shelters for internally displaced persons, and 33
were occupied by armed groups. Based on a sample of 143 schools, the estimated cost of the
damage was $269 million. Estimates by the Ministry of Public Health and Population, show that
900 of 3,652 facilities providing vaccination services were not operating in early 2016, leaving 2.6
million children under 15 at risk of contracting communicable diseases.

Economic Costs

Yemen has a history of instability but the recent war has pushed the country into a humanitarian
crisis. Economic activity has collapsed in almost all sectors of the economy, particularly oil; access
to social services including health and education has dropped significantly; and imports have
contracted substantially. Oil production, the main source of government revenue, declined
sharply following the uprising in 2011 due to increased insurgencies in oil fields and later on as a
result of the ongoing proxy war that started in March 2015. The economy contracted sharply in
2015 and 2016 by 28.1 percent and 4.2 percent respectively. The UNDP Business Survey Report
estimates several firms suspended their operations, including 35 percent in the service sector, 29
percent of the industrial enterprises and 20 percent of trading companies. This swelled further

                                                                                                     34
                                                       MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR        APRIL 2017
the already critical unemployment rate in the country. Combined with the effects of conflicts on
other sectors (social, agriculture, fishery and livestock, trade and industry, banking system, etc.),
this worsened the living condition of Yemenis. Inflation reached 39 percent in 2015, and is
expected to increase further as fiscal performance is continuously weakening. The fiscal deficit
has widened and foreign financing of the budget has largely come to a halt, as many development
partners suspended their engagement. On current expenditure, the premium on wages and
salaries were cut as a response to lower oil prices and government’s shrinking finances as well as
a large cut in subsidies from 8 percent of GDP in 2011 to less than 1 percent in 2015. Public
investment was low prior to 2011 but effectively halted afterwards to less than 0.2 percent of
GDP in 2016. The Yemeni exchange rate has come under stress due to the loss in oil revenues
and lack of foreign financing. International reserves declined to less than $2 billion in late 2015
(2 months of imports). Consequently, in February 2016, the central bank stopped supporting
imports at the official exchange rate except for wheat and rice. The government’s reliance on
central bank financing of the fiscal deficit led to inflation and an increase in domestic debt stock
by about 18 percent of GDP to an estimated 53 percent of GDP in 2016.

Libya
Pre-Conflict (1970-2010)

The economy of Libya depends on oil for almost all exports earnings, 80 percent of government
revenue and half of GDP. As a result, per capita income in Libya calculated by the World Bank
was $11,934 in 2010, higher than the MENA average and close to the highest per capita income
in Africa. The government supported the same Arab social contract as the rest of the Arab
countries, providing citizens free health and education, public sector jobs and food and fuel
subsidies in return for limited voice and freedom. Following the lifting of UN sanctions in 2003,
economic activity increased steadily for seven years. During 2004 –10, average real GDP growth
was approximately 5 percent, annual consumer price inflation averaged less than 4 percent, and
official foreign assets increased from $20 billion at end-2003 to $170 billion at end-2010. More
than 80 percent of the formal labor force worked in the public sector. The limited private sector
that existed was handicapped by the dominance of the state and crippling institutions.
Consequently, governance indicators remained poor, job creation was lackluster as it was heavily
reliant on public sector while dependence on expatriate workers increased (Figure 2.7). A
combination of these factors led to the 2011 Arab Spring uprising.

Similar to other Arab countries, Libya made good progress in education and health. Life
expectancy increased from 46.9 in 1970 to 75.1 in 2010 and the rate of literacy among the adults
rose to 89.5 percent with 99.5 percent of youth between 15-24 years were literate in 2010. The
under-five mortality rate also fell from 139 in 1970 to 28 in 2010. Years of investment in primary
education led to an increase in the literacy rate among people aged 15 years and older from 60

percent of population to over 85 percent of population in 2010. While the gender gap in literacy
narrowed in 2010, literacy rates were still higher among males than females. The literacy rate for
males in 2010 stood at 96 percent and for female at 83 percent.

Human Costs
The war, insecurity and violence have impacted more than 3 million people across Libya (half the
population) of which an estimated 2.4 million people are in need of protection and humanitarian
assistance. These include about 241,000 internally displaced persons, about 437,000 non-
displaced with special needs and another 125,000 refugees fleeing the country to Europe and
Italy in particular. Of these, half are women and one third are children and mostly located in the

western part of the country. In addition to the ongoing civil conflict, Daesh is still present on the
ground. The battle has led to a large number of deaths and injuries among civilians. In 2016 alone,
between January and October, about 498 civilians were reported dead or injured. A survey by
UNOCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) shows that only
four hospitals were found to be performing above 75 percent functionality out of the total 98
hospitals surveyed. People lack clean water and sanitation facilities (54 percent of people report
reduction in the quantity of safe water), proper housing (due to significant damages to housing
and infrastructure, see next section), education services (over 558 schools are either no longer
functional or partially functional) and food (17 percent of IDPs are food insecure). In addition,
IDPs, returnees and non-displaced are easy targets of violations of their rights and are exposed
to high security and safety risks (Table 2.3).

Children. Armed conflict has severely affected children, depriving them of access to basic social
services. UNICEF reported that 1,060,000 children are estimated to be suffering from acute
malnutrition, of whom 279,146 suffer from severe malnutrition. Thousands of children, especially
girls, are out of school in different parts of the country, as schools are not functional, having been
damaged by armed conflict or used as shelters for IDPs. Children are recruited into armed and
extremist groups and a target for human traffickers, exposing them to life threats. There are
estimates that about 439,000 children out of a total children of 2.4 million are in need of

protection services, such as psychosocial support, community-based child protection services,
and community reintegration to overcome the trauma caused by violence. Displacement and lack
of security have led parents to pull girls out of school while many are pushed into early marriage.

Physical Costs
Libya is fully dependent on oil and the six-year conflict has blockaded the oil terminals and ports,
with some tribes shutting down the fields of the government. In this report, we will provide
estimates of the damages to oil fields in terms of lost revenues due to insurgency, and the
damage assessment to civilian infrastructure prepared by the REACH Initiative for Benghazi, the
most damaged city in Libya during the war. Due to several attacks to oil terminals over the past
four years, the Libyan oil fields have encountered major infrastructure damage, blocking oil
exports. Estimates by the EU show that militia control of major oil terminals (Ras, Lanuf, Sidra,
Zueitina and Brega) for almost three years has cost Libya over $100 billion in lost revenue.

Among cities in Libya, Benghazi has the highest rate of damages to buildings due to the war and
militia attacks. The IMPACT damage assessment covers 13 areas in Benghazi through satellite
imagery over two periods of August 2015 and subsequent analysis in April 2016. The analysis
identifies three types of building damages: destroyed (between 75-100% of structure destroyed),
severely damaged (between 30-75% of structure destroyed), and moderately damaged (between
5-30% of structure damaged). The damage assessment shows that in August 2015, of the 1,620
damaged structures, 658 structures were destroyed, 276 structures were severely damaged and
686 were moderately damaged with an additional 537 identified as possibly damaged. Analysis
of April 2016 with satellite imagery reveals a significant increase in damage. An additional 1,791
structures were identified including 455 destroyed, 580 severely damaged and 756 moderately
damaged with an additional 706 identified as possibly damaged. Overall, between August 2015
and April 2016, about 3,344 structures were identified as destroyed, severely damaged or
moderately damaged, with an additional 1,152 identified as possibly damaged (See Map 2.2).
Economic Costs
Six years of war in Libya has significantly undermined the achievements made in health and
education. Moreover, economic activity has been disrupted and the social fabric torn by
increased violence. The economy has remained in recession for the fourth consecutive year in
2016. Libya produced more than 1.6 million barrels per day of crude oil prior to the uprising in
2011; that has fallen to around 380,000 barrels per day. The non-hydrocarbon output remains
weak due to disruptions in the supply chain and insecurity as well as lack of adequate investment.
Real GDP is estimated to have declined by 8.9 percent in 2015 and it shrank further by 2.5 percent
in 2016. Per capita income has fallen to less than $5,000 in 2016 compared to almost $13,000 in
2012. Inflation reached unprecedented levels in 2016 at 26 percent, up from 10 percent in 2015
driven by high food prices. Lack of funding to finance imports, especially food, led to shortages

in basic commodities and expansion of black markets activities. The situation was exacerbated
by households’ attempting to store food.
Few Libyans work outside the government and the public sector has not been able to provide
jobs for new entrants in the labor market. Libya has recorded high unemployment rates for the
past two decades. The official unemployment rate stood at 13.5 percent in 2010 with youth
unemployment estimated at double that rate. Oil revenues (the lifeline of the government) have
fallen sharply to only a fifth of their pre-revolution levels, while spending has remained high. The
share of the public wage bill in GDP is about 53 percent in 2016. Investments have been
insufficient for sustaining adequate public provision of health, education, electricity, water and
sanitation services. Being highly dependent on hydrocarbon exports and food imports, Libya’s
balance of payments and fiscal space suffered in 2016. Foreign reserves have remained the main
source of financing of the budget deficit.

Principles in Rebuilding Post-Conflict MENA
The description of the pre-conflict economies of these three countries as well as of the
devastating effects of the wars points to a fundamental principle: Reconstruction has to be a
nation-building exercise. It has to go beyond repairing the physical damage of the war to

                                                                                                 39
                                                     MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR       APRIL 2017
addressing the root causes of the conflict. Relatedly, reconstruction has to be a peace-building
exercise, if nothing else to prevent a recurrence of conflict. It should be designed to influence the
conflict dynamics towards peace by changing the calculus of the belligerents.

With these overarching principles, the assessments of the damage and economic costs of the
three civil wars in MENA - estimated in the order of $300 billion - as well as the review of previous
experience with post-war reconstruction programs such as Iraq after 2003 (Box 2.2), suggest
certain specific principles that could guide a post-conflict reconstruction strategy in the region.
1. Massive but Modulated Financing Supported by the International Community

The scale of damage is such that just bringing the economies of Syria, Yemen and Libya back to
their pre-war levels will require a colossal amount of resources. Estimates of the order of two to
three times the country’s 2010 GDP would not be unreasonable. However, any recovery program
should strive for going beyond reproducing 2010 GDP since, as shown above, the economies
would have grown significantly in the absence of a civil war. Syria, for instance, had an historic
opportunity to break the lower-middle-income barrier and become an upper middle-income
country by 2025. Catching up to this long-term trajectory could take several years and trillions of
dollars. Yet it is only fair to the people of these countries that any reconstruction plan keep its
eyes on this seemingly unattainable trajectory and seek to achieve as much of its promises as
possible.

In addition, much of the damage to human capital - children pulled out of school, re-emergence
of communicable diseases, psychological trauma - will have long-term, possibly intergenerational
consequences. Hence the focus of reconstruction should go beyond restoring the current lost
output to preventing a long-term and possibly permanent stagnation in the economy.

Arriving at an estimate of the resources needed is only the first step. The next one is identifying
how the funds will be raised. In the cases of Syria, Yemen and especially Libya, the oil sector —
when it is back in production—could represent an important source of financing, just as it did for
Iraq. To be sure, oil prices are unlikely to go above $60 per barrel (Devarajan and Mottaghi,
2016a) and restoring oil production will itself require financing. But the experience of other post-
war recoveries shows that countries with significant natural resources are able to revive their
economies faster than those without (Devarajan and Mottaghi, 2016b). So prioritizing the
resumption of oil production could both help revive the economy and finance further
reconstruction.

That said, even a fully functional oil sector would not generate enough resources to finance the
post-conflict reconstruction in any of these countries. This is where the international community
needs to step in. Given the sizable spillovers of these wars to neighboring countries and places
further away such as Europe, it is in the international community’s interest that peace, once


                                                                                                  40
                                                      MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR       APRIL 2017
achieved, should be sustained. And this requires that the post-war reconstruction program be
adequately financed. Indeed, agreement around a reconstruction program could be the point of
convergence among different regional and international players in the current conflicts.

 Box 2.2 Lessons from Post-2003 Reconstruction of Iraq
 In the aftermath of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the international community, led by the
 United States, embarked on an ambitious program of recovery and reconstruction of the country.
 Today, Iraq is beset with sectarian conflict, including a protracted struggle against Daesh, a fragile
 economy (thanks to low oil prices), infrastructure deficits, and multiple governance challenges such
 as widespread corruption and lawlessness in parts of the country. What lessons can be drawn from
 the reconstruction experience for the other conflict countries in MENA?

  The reconstruction was well-funded (to the tune of $60 billion), complemented by about $126
   billion from the Iraqi capital fund (from the era of high oil prices). Yet these funds were not well-
   used to strengthen, or even work with, Iraqi institutions. By contrast, an international trust fund
   to support institution-building had only $1.8 billion.
  The large allocation by the U.S. often created pressure to disburse within a fiscal year, leading to
   some unproductive expenditures. For instance, large sums were spent on increasing electricity
   generation by buying gas turbines or restarting generation plants without much repair.
   Eventually, electricity generation fell.
  Several departments of the U.S. government had reconstruction plans ready before the end of
   the war. Unfortunately, most of these plans were not used, partly because of poor coordination
   among the different departments.
  The reconstruction effort had limited results because it was largely “supply-driven” with little
   consultation with Iraqi counterparts on planning and implementation.
  The large sums of money involved also contributed to significant fraud, waste and abuse of
   reconstruction funds.
  Decentralization was part of the post-war agenda, aimed at preventing a return to dictatorship.
   Despite resources spent and a new constitution that stipulates a federal political system, not
   much progress has been made.

 In sum, the experience with post-2003 reconstruction of Iraq provides some sharp lessons, mostly of
 “what not to do”, for post-conflict reconstruction in MENA. In particular, the corrosive effects of
 large amounts of funding that are used for “supply-driven” projects without even minimal
 consultations with the recipient is a wake-up call. In the rush to help these war-torn economies,
 external actors may need to suppress their usual instincts and seek different approaches.

MENA, therefore, needs the global community to come together and deliver a joint program, just
as they did in the final days of the Second World War at Bretton Woods in July 1944 (Box 2.3).

 Box 2.3 Successful Post-Conflict Nation-Building: Germany and Japan
 Germany and Japan set a standard for post-conflict nation-building and their success proves that post-
 conflict societies could transform themselves; and that major transformation could endure (Neeson,
 2008). The Marshall Plan which was officially launched in 1948 and ended in 1951 was critical in
 rebuilding Western Europe and Germany, in particular. However, the plan was preceded by series of
 conferences starting in 1944 (during the war time) at the Bretton Woods Monetary Conference at
 which large amount of funds were pledged for rebuilding these countries. The International Monetary
 Fund (IMF), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)- which were conceived at
 the Bretton Woods conference - and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, provided $1.2
 billion and $1.1 billion in 1946 and 1947 respectively. The United States provided large funds and aid
 to a number of European countries, amounting $3.4 billion in 1946 and $4.7 billion in 1947, enabling
 Germany and the rest of Europe to pay for the large flow of imports that were instrumental for the
 post-war recovery (Dubbins et al., 2003).

 The Bretton Woods arrangements did not only provide funds but achieved clarity on what was called
 an “international economic order”, or the “(institutional) rules of the game”. Policies or politics and
 access to financial resources went together. “Consensus” (except for the ‘Eastern Bloc” countries and
 the emerging developing countries) on these rules established the quasi-public good, the “international
 economic order”.

 Both Germany and Japan showed similarities in their approach to post-war reconstruction. They
 enacted political, economic and social reconstruction aimed at rebuilding the country. First, they
 amended and ratified their Constitutions by empowering women, guaranteeing fundamental human
 rights, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local
 government. Priorities were given to reforming the educational system, and the national budget system
 along with media which was considered a major vehicle for accomplishing reform and democratization.

 In translating this “mechanism” to the MENA region, the quest should not only be for resources to
 rebuild countries and economies, but also about policies as the past was not sustainable, judging by
 the Arab Spring events.

While the financial and technical support of regional and international partners is critical, the
reconstruction program should be a national-driven and not a donor exercise. It should be based
on national visions and agendas developed through inclusive forums of debate. Donors can
reinforce this process by working through national institutions, even if they are nascent, rather
than impose a foreign entity in an already fragile situation (See Box 2.2).

                                                                                                                   42

While raising the necessary financing is important, the pace and rhythm by which the money is
spent is just as important. The experience of Iraq (and possibly Afghanistan), as well as other
high-aid developing countries, teaches us that spending beyond the absorptive capacity of the
recipient can create huge distortions, rent-seeking behavior, and possibly make the situation
worse (See Box 2.2). If complementary inputs such as technical knowledge and incentives are not
in place, large amounts of financing will serve to raise prices beyond reasonable levels. It can also
lead people to favor expedient, short-term investments (to show that the money was spent) at
the expense of longer-term, institution-building measures. Rather than focusing on just raising
the total amount of money estimated as needed, the principle should be that no sensible and
realistic post-conflict reconstruction activity should be financially constrained.

2. Rebuild Institutions not just Infrastructure

Any reconstruction program will require prioritizing and sequencing of interventions. In Syria, for
example, should they first rebuild Aleppo or Homs? Should electricity be restored before
restarting children’s schools? Given that all three countries followed an autocratic, state-led
development model in the past—a model whose breakdown led to the Arab Spring protests that,
in turn, led to civil war—it is essential that the reconstruction strategy not reproduce the old
social contract (Devarajan and Mottaghi, 2015b). Rather, it should be people-led, -driven, and –
controlled. Decisions on resource allocation, even for large-scale infrastructure projects, should
not be taken exclusively at the central-government level. There should be mechanisms by which
the public is consulted and their voice has an impact on the decisions.

Giving citizens voice in decision-making is important for two reasons. First, as just noted, it would
be a departure from the old social contract, which has clearly broken down. Fuel subsidies, for
instance, are not only inefficient and regressive, but they serve to disempower people, especially
poor people. For the only way they can get a benefit from the state is to consume fuel (Devarajan
and Mottaghi, 2014). Replacing these fuel subsidies with cash transfers not only reduces
inefficiencies such as pollution and congestion associated with excess fuel consumption, but it
gives people a choice of what to consume out of the benefit they receive. In this spirit, the post-
conflict reconstruction program should try to give people a choice over what types of benefits
they wish to receive.

The second reason for consulting with the public before, say, building infrastructure is that the
three civil wars have become sectarian conflicts with a large number of displaced people. In Syria,
over half the population has left their homes. Inasmuch as they were fleeing violence perpetrated
by groups different from themselves, some of these people may not wish to return to whence
they came. They may not even wish to live with people of their own sect.

In a study of rebuilding post-war Bosnia, Whitt (2010) finds that people do not unconditionally
trust their co-ethnics and universally distrust other groups. He suggests that factors other than

                                                                                                  43
                                                     MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR        APRIL 2017
ethnicity could create trust among different sects in society. Institutions that cut across ethnic or
sectarian lines, but build trust, can be critical in rebuilding post-war economies. While helping
these institutions emerge, one concrete measure of post-conflict reconstruction could be to give
citizens cash transfers and let them decide where to move before rebuilding infrastructure. Not
only will this avoid wasteful infrastructure spending, but it would empower citizens and possibly
incentivize local governments to attract citizens, both of which would help build trust in the state.

A particular way for the reconstruction program to be people-led is to crowd in the private sector.
A post-conflict government will have neither the resources nor capacity to rebuild the economy.
But the private sector can - and will - be the engine of growth in the aftermath of the war. The
government should promote a dynamic business environment and institutional reforms, based
on a consensus emerging from an inclusive dialogue on reconstruction, so that the power of the
private sector can be unleashed. Privileging the private sector will also be important in facilitating
the return of refugees, many of whom abandoned their businesses during the war. Finally, a
dynamic private sector is the strongest antidote to a resumption of conflict.

3. Local Autonomy with Fair Distribution of Oil Revenues

All three civil-war countries are oil economies that, before the war started, earned between 35
and 90 percent of government revenues from oil. Indeed, oil may have been a reason for the
conflict. Many oil countries suffer from poor public expenditure outcomes at least partly because
oil revenues, unlike tax revenues, go directly from the oil company to the state without passing
through the hands of the citizens. As a result, citizens may not know the extent of oil revenues.
And even if they knew, they may not have as much incentive to scrutinize how government
spends the money, because they do not think of it as “their money” (even though it is). This
syndrome often results in inefficient and ineffective public expenditures, eventually leading to
citizen dissatisfaction and protest at the government, as happened in the Arab Spring. In short,
any post-conflict reconstruction strategy, especially if it is financed by revenues from a revived
oil sector, has to pay close attention to how those revenues are spent and—equally
importantly—how citizens perceive how those revenues are spent.

Moreover, as noted earlier, these wars have evolved into sectarian conflicts, often with the
warring parties controlling particular parts of the country. In order to maintain the integrity of
the country after a peace settlement—to avoid various groups seceding and forming their own
country—the central government may devolve some fiscal authority to sub-national entities.

Since they are all oil economies, how oil revenues are shared among the sub-national units then
becomes crucial to the success of a post-conflict reconstruction program. On the one hand, it
may be efficient to distribute oil revenues to where they can be most productive. On the other
hand, to the extent that some part of the conflict was due to grievance by one group’s not getting

                                                                                                   44
                                                      MENA ECONOMIC MONITOR       APRIL 2017
their “share” of the nation’s resources, an allocation that does not take this factor into account
may lead to a resumption of conflict. There is also the particular issue of people living near the
oil fields who often feel shortchanged when oil revenues are distributed to other parts of the
country but they bear the pollution and other costs of oil production. Finally, with the large
number of displaced people, there will be large population movements post-conflict, to which
any particular allocation of oil revenues needs to be calibrated.

Taking all these considerations into account, perhaps the equal distribution of oil revenues to
every citizen (including possibly citizens who are currently refugees) should be considered. Such
a policy cannot be considered “unfair” by one group or another (since everybody gets the same
amount). Furthermore, as with distributing reconstruction resources to individuals and letting
them move where they like, this distribution of oil revenues will accommodate the movement of
people after the conflict. Indeed, subnational governments may try to entice people to move to
their jurisdiction because every person comes with his or her money. Most importantly, this
distribution of oil revenues means that government will need to tax citizens to finance public
goods, thereby increasing the chances that citizens will hold government accountable for
spending decisions.

Risks and challenges
The major risk in the near future is the
political uncertainty around the full im-

Iranian presidential elections are sched-

will remain below 3 percent. Furthermore,
