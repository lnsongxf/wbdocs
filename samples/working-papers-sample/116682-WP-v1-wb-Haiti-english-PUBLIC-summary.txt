               financial hardship Haitians face formida-
               ble challenges to their health. Maternal
               and infant mortality rates are 5 and 3
               times higher than the regional average.
Access to health care is low compared to low-income
countries and particularly among the poorest house-
holds. Delivery of preventive health services like immu-
nizations is below minimum standards. Patients often
bypass the public health system for lack of trust, and
rely on consultations from traditional healers or simply
purchase medication directly from unregulated provid-
ers for their medical needs. Haiti faces the challenge of
meeting the United Nations’ Sustainable Development
Goals on health and improving outcomes for the
poor despite declines in external financing for health
and relatively low government contributions com-
pared to other low-income countries to finance the
health sector. In light of this, Haiti’s healthcare system
must operate more efficiently, and access to services

Cholera and the Importance of Basic Services

Relative to other low-income countries and the Latin American and Caribbean region, Haiti performs poorly on water, sanitation and
hygiene indicators, which is concerning given the country’s cholera epidemic. Cholera deaths are disproportionately higher in the poor-
est households -- 2.4 percent reported death of at least one household member, while only 0.1 percent of the wealthiest reported the
same outcome. Members of the poorest households are 24 times more likely to die from cholera than those in the wealthiest households.

Haiti reports a comparably high rate of treatment for children with diarrheal disease (58 percent), which is slightly higher than the aver-
age for similar countries (50 percent) and just below the Latin American and Caribbean region’s average (59 percent). This indicator also
increased considerably since the 2005-6 survey, up from 44 percent (Figure 1). However, 18 percent of children under 5 still die from
diarrheal diseases in Haiti.

played an increasingly marginal role in financing the sector. The increase in external financing has changed the structural composition
of health spending. In 1995, households were the main financiers of the health system through out-of-pocket payments (46 percent),
followed by the government (41 percent) and then NGOs (13 percent). Since then, the proportion contributed by the government has
decreased substantially down to 21 percent in 2014. In the same year, out-of-pocket payments contributed 35 percent of total health
expenditure while NGOs and other private institutions serving households represented 44 percent (Figure 4).

In the past, Haiti’s health sector received domestic allocations of between 9 and 14 percent of the national budget. Between 2000 and
2005 government health expenditure as a percentage of the general government budget was 14 percent on average. During the years
between 2006 and 2010 the same indicator was 9 percent. Due primarily to donor funding displacement in the post-earthquake period,
the national budget allocations to health in 2012 were dramatically reduced to 3.4 percent (Figure 5). In Haiti, government expenditure
on health represented just 6.1 percent of total government expenditure in 2014, well below the Abuja declaration recommended allo-
cation of 15 percent.

The drop in external financing raises issues of sustainability of investment programs. From the highest levels in 2012–13 to 2014–15, the
off-budget external financing has declined by 25 times and the on-budget external financing by five times, representing a massive loss
for the health system. Public treasury funds have also decreased but at a slower pace, while the operating budget has increased slightly
but not enough to compensate for the sharp drop in external funding. A large portion of external resources is currently used to finance
operating costs such as vaccines, the health workforce, and medical products. With the withdrawal of external funding, the Haitian gov-
ernment needs to start paying recurrent expenses to ensure the maintenance of capital investment and the functioning of the health
system. Large financing gaps for recurrent costs are emerging, and they are likely to continue. Faced with lack of a system for tracking
donor resources and how they are used and with limited public financing, the government may not be able to plan and take over the
costs of maintenance and operation.
