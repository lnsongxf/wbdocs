THE WORLD BANK AND SOGI
The World Bank approaches sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)
inclusion through our commitments on gender equality and social inclusion.
Building on its work on HIV/AIDS over the last decade, the World Bank has
taken a more comprehensive approach to SOGI inclusion throughout the
organization’s management and operations.
In January 2015, the Bank established a SOGI Task Force to place a stronger
emphasis on the SOGI agenda as well as to spearhead a coherent effort for
SOGI inclusion. The multi-sectorial task force has members from different
parts of the World Bank, which opens opportunities for influencing existing
and forthcoming operational and analytical work.
