LOOKING FORWARD

CAEWDP will continue to provide support at the national
and regional level to promote energy and water security
in Central Asia. Moving forward, CAEWDP will shift from
establishing conditions for cooperation to strengthening
confidence and institutional frameworks to facilitate the
realization of the benefits of cooperation. This would be
accomplished through: (i) greater focus on investments
to strengthen energy and water security at the regional
level, while (ii) building capacity for decision support and
dialogue from the national to the regional level.

Efforts are underway to establish and shape a third
funding phase of CAEWDP   . Strong support exists for the
continuation of the CAEWDP approach which will also
build on lessons learned. The concept for the third
funding phase was presented to the Donor Advisory
Committee (DAC) for consultation in December 2016 and
is in the process of being finalized and refined with the
feedback received from the development partners. It is
planned that the third funding phase will be operational
end 2017 or early 2018.

           CAEWDP’s long-term goals are to eliminate winter energy
           shortages, enhance water productivity and increase
           electricity trade within and outside the region. Hence,
           the program is structured around three pillars to reflect
           these goals. CAEWDP’s role in strengthening regional
           cooperation and leveraging the energy-water nexus
           is particularly significant, given the geographic and
           institutional complexities of Central Asia’s energy and
           water linkages. The three pillars of the program are:

               energy resources at the regional levels—both within

               promotes and studies high-value energy investments
               that focus on energy security, energy efficiency,
               trade and accountability, infrastructure planning and
               institutional development. Additional activities also

                       SHORT-TERM STEPS:

                       •	 Develop inter-governmental and stakeholder agreement on the potential benefits and the nature and
                          objectives of the system to be adopted;
                       •	 Define the type of transactions or market to be developed (e.g. bilateral contracts, spot markets, etc.)
                          and well as principles for a fair methodology for settlements and compensation of schedule deviations;
                       •	 Identify the role of central trading and dispatch institutions (such as CDC Energia);
                       •	 Improve regional control systems, communications, and acquire appropriate software;
                       •	 Identify and adopt necessary pan-regional technical and commercial documents (e.g., grid codes,
                          metering codes, settlement rules), and
                       •	 Define a scheme for mutual support during emergency operations.




                        MEDIUM-TERM STEPS:

                        •	 Improve system supervision and control software;
                        •	 Improve commercial metering, and
                        •	 Adopt a system for coordinated system planning, especially insofar as high voltage grid
                           development is concerned.




                        LONG-TERM STEPS:

                        •	 Implement necessary technological changes and improvements, and
                        •	 Move forward with regional grid development and power system projects.
