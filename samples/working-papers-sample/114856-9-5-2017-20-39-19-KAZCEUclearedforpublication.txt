Overview
In 2016,               The economy continued to suffer from a protracted slowdown in global oil
Kazakhstan’s GDP       prices and weak domestic demand, resulting in a real GDP growth rate
growth continued       estimated at 1 percent in 2016. The current account deficit widened as a
to slow and real       result of lower oil prices and oil output. However, this was more than offset
wages declined         by higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly to expand
further, negatively    oil production. The improved overall external position enabled the central
affecting poverty      bank to partially replenish its international reserves, which it had drawn
rates.                 down to finance foreign exchange interventions in previous years. Private
                       consumption weakened considerably in 2016 due to the pass-through effect
                       of currency devaluation, which pushed the inflation rate to an average of 14.6
                       percent for the year and undermined the purchasing power of households.
                       Official data suggest that average real wages declined by 0.9 percent in 2016.
                       As real incomes fell, the poverty rate (measured at the international poverty
                       line of US$5 per day) rose to an estimated 19.8 percent in the year.

The authorities        Seeking to stimulate domestic demand and the nonoil economy, the
reacted by             government’s macroeconomic policy stance remained accommodative in
extending              2016. As the slowdown continued, the authorities postponed a planned fiscal
additional             consolidation and extended economic support measures, financed by the oil
spending measures      fund and additional borrowing. The economic support program is focused on
and easing             fostering domestic demand through higher public wages and social transfers,
monetary               continued provision of subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and small
conditions.            and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and, more recently, on extended
                       support to the banking sector. The authorities are planning to address
                       vulnerabilities in the banking sector by recapitalizing large banks, which are
                       burdened by a high level of nonperforming loans (NPLs). The central bank
                       also started easing gradually its contractionary monetary policy as
                       inflationary pressures subsided in Q4 2016, but bank lending to the private
                       sector remained depressed.

                       fostering development of a more dynamic, export-oriented and productive

A. Recent Socio-Economic Developments
Recent political events
In early 2017,        Under the recently enacted constitutional amendments, the presidency
President             retained its main responsibilities and major policymaking influence, while
Nursultan             devolving some powers to the executive government and parliament. The
Nazarbayev            president would continue to focus on strategic functions, including defense
enacted political     and security, but management of the socioeconomic policy would be
reforms aiming to     transferred to the government. The amendments also transfer the right to
create a more         approve state programs—and create or dissolve state agencies—from the
balanced political    president to the cabinet. The proposed changes would strengthen the
system.               Mazhilis, the lower chamber of parliament, by giving it greater power in the
                      approval and dismissal of cabinet members. In line with an existing strategy
                      of strengthening local governance and public accountability, Mr Nazarbayev
                      also pledged to grant greater powers to local governments.

Following the         The president called for a new wave of economic transformation, the
announcement of       Modernization 3.0, with the goal of becoming more globally competitive and
political reforms,    joining the ranks of the world's 30 most developed countries by 2050.
the president set     President Nazarbayev outlined five priorities for economic transformation:
out priorities for    (i) accelerated technological modernization of the economy; (ii) improved
economic              business environment; (iii) increased macroeconomic stability; (iv) enhanced
transformation.       quality of human capital; and (v) strengthened institutions, security and anti-
                      corruption efforts. The address underscored the need to diversify the
                      economy away from commodity exports and to raise productivity and
                      improve the effectiveness of the state apparatus. A strategic development
                      plan, Kazakhstan-2025, will be developed to detail the actions that the
                      government will take to achieve these priorities.


Growth and inflation
In 2016,              Real GDP growth slowed from 1.2 percent in 2015 to an estimated 1 percent
Kazakhstan’s          in 2016 as oil prices continued to fall and domestic demand weakened. On the
economy continued     supply side, a deteriorating performance by the oil sector—the result of
to suffer from a      declining oil prices and oil output—and slowing growth in the services
protracted            sector—driven by a contraction in wholesale trade—hindered overall
slowdown in global    economic growth. However, this was partly offset by rising output from the
oil prices and weak   agriculture and metallurgy sectors. Construction activity also expanded,
domestic demand.      driven by large projects in the oil sector, boosting imports. On the demand
                      side, while investment activity increased, private consumption continued
                      contributing to the slowdown due to a pass-through effect of currency
                      devaluation that fueled inflation and undermined the purchasing power of
                      households (Table 1).

Inflation surged in            The depreciation of the Kazakhstani tenge (KZT) that began in the fourth
2016, driven by                quarter of 2015—following the authorities’ move to a flexible exchange rate
price increases for            regime in August 2015—led to sizable adjustments of prices for imported
imported goods.                goods. The headline inflation rate averaged 14.6 percent in 2016, peaking in
                               the third quarter (Figure 1). The key drivers of inflation were imported
                               clothing and footwear, medicine, and household appliances, which registered
                               price increases of over 20 percent in 2016 (Figure 2). The earlier removal of
                               price controls for certain types of gasoline also contributed to higher prices
                               for domestically-produced goods and services.1 The pass-through effects
                               from the currency devaluation began to ease in the last quarter of 2016. The
                               headline inflation rate almost halved from over 17 percent in the third
                               quarter of 2016 to below 8 percent in early 2017.

(by removing distortions in retail prices) but led to a higher contribution of gasoline prices to the headline inflation rate
level from September 2015 through August 2016.

External sector
The external              While the current account deficit widened further due to the unfavorable
position improved         terms of trade, it was offset by higher net FDI inflows, mainly into the oil
substantially in          sector for production capacity expansion. In particular, lower oil prices and
2016, supported by        oil output resulted in a significant widening of the current account deficit—
higher FDI inflows.       from US$5.5 billion or 3 percent of GDP in 2015 to US$8.2 billion or 6.1
                          percent in 2016 (Table 2). However, investments in oil production capacity
                          expansion (by Tengizchevroil and Karachaganak) pushed up net FDI inflows
                          to US$14.3 billion or 10.7 percent of GDP, more than offsetting the worsening
                          in the current account deficit. Consequently, the overall deficit of the balance
                          of payments (excluding investment by the Oil Fund) narrowed
                          substantially—from US$10.6 billion in 2015 to $2.4 billion in 2016.

Financial sector
Activity in the               Banking sector lending was flat in 2016, reflecting heightened bank risk
banking sector                aversion and increased attention to collections. Aside from disbursements
remained                      under the government’s economic support program, there were few
depressed, despite            opportunities for new lending. The large banks continued to be sustained by
ample liquidity.              relatively strong liquidity flows from quasi-state sources and state-controlled
                              companies. Despite a slight strengthening of the tenge in the first half of 2016,
                              the share of FX in banks’ balance sheets remained stubbornly high throughout
                              2016—at 33 percent of total lending (the bulk, 29 percent of total lending, is
                              represented by FX loans to legal entities; 3.6 percent is FX loans to physical
                              persons). This reflected the challenges facing banks as they move away from
                              FX exposures, many of which are now nonperforming.

Vulnerabilities in In line with official mandates, the share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to
the banking system total gross loans has been reduced from a 2014 peak of over 20 percent to 6.7
persisted.         percent in January 2017.2 However, severe shocks to the system—including
                   currency volatility and the economic slowdown, the flat lending growth, as
                   well as mounting banking crises in other oil-exporting countries (for example,
                   Azerbaijan)—suggest that banks may be facing looming challenges.
                   Furthermore, the relaxation of prudential regulations in July 2015 (for
                   instance, of those calling for consolidated financial reporting by financial
                   institutions in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards,
                   IFRS), a dramatic increase in the sale of distressed assets into special-purpose
                   vehicles (SPVs), leniency in loan classification, and under-provisioning,
                   suggest that official data may need to be supplemented with additional
                   information to properly assess the health of the commercial banks.

                             resolution of systemically-important banks. Where governments have tried
                             to intervene discreetly, this has often led to costlier solutions than necessary.
                             To maintain depositor confidence—a top priority—coordination among
                             safety-net players and appropriate public communication is essential. The
                             creation of an accountable, efficient and transparent asset management entity
                             for the workout of distressed assets is also important. Following the planned
                             merger of two of the largest ‘too-big-to-fail’ banks in Kazakhstan, maintaining
                             fair competition in the banking sector may become an issue.


Social indicators
The economic                 Following a decline of 2.4 percent in 2015, average real wages fell by a further
slowdown put                 0.9 percent in 2016. With real incomes declining, the poverty rate (measured
downward                     at the international poverty line of US$5 per day) rose to an estimated 19.8
pressure on                  percent in 2016, up from 19.5 percent in 2015 and 16.1 percent in 2014. The
household income             decline in real income was primarily the result of fewer employment
and negatively               opportunities for both wage earners and the self-employed. Total

                             market participation rate declined from 66.4 percent in 2014 to 65.7 percent
                             in 2015. Meanwhile, the youth unemployment rate rose from 6.8 percent in
                             2013 to 8.3 percent in 2015.

The authorities              An increase in social transfers primarily benefitted households receiving

3 The capital position of QAZKOM, the system’s largest bank with 24 percent of lending and 18 percent of physical person
deposits, fell below the minimum capital requirements including buffers with effect from January 1, 2017. As of January 1,
2017, QAZKOM’s ratio of Tier-1 capital to total assets stood at 9.3 percent (below the requisite 9.5 percent for systemically-
important banks) and Tier-1 capital to sum of risk-weighted assets stood at 10.1 percent (below the requisite 10.5 percent).
4 An official announcement of the impending merger of QAZKOM with Halyk Bank, the first and second-largest banks by

loan volume, respectively, followed several months of speculation. The mergers are expected to impact negatively on the
fiscal accounts. In early 2017, the government released budget forecasts projecting a cost of US$6.5 billion to recapitalize
QAZKOM, a half of which will come from the Oil Fund. Meanwhile, consolidation has been agreed between Tsesnabank and
Bank CenterCredit. South Korea’s Kookmin Bank will sell its 42 percent stake in Bank CenterCredit to a group of investors
including Tsesnabank, while IFC is also selling its 10 percent stake in the bank. Details about the pricing of these deals are

 Box 1. How to Promote Job Creation in a Difficult Economic Context
 Kazakhstan created almost 2.5 million jobs between 2001 and 2016—mainly in non-tradable, service-
 oriented sectors—in the context of a favorable global environment, high oil prices and robust economic
 growth. However, the quality and productivity of many jobs remain relatively low. Moreover, about 30
 percent of the employed are self-employed, and many self-employed workers are classified as
 “unproductive.”
 To create high-quality (and productive) jobs, Kazakhstan will need to overcome three key challenges. First,
 as oil prices are expected to recover slowly, and modest growth rates are projected over the medium term,
 policymakers cannot rely on external tailwinds (particularly those linked to the oil sector and its spillovers
 on services) to drive job creation as it happened during the oil boom. Second, the authorities will need to
 design policies to address the large share of self-employed workers who are underemployed or suffer from
 low productivity. Finally, starting around 2020, the job-creation rate will need to increase significantly, as a
 large cohort of young people will begin entering the labor force.
 A potential comprehensive strategy to create more and higher quality jobs must incorporate both short- and
 long-term objectives and actions (Box Diagram 1). Short-term policies will need to focus on adjusting to a
 context of persistently lower economic growth rates by adopting an appropriate set of macro-fiscal policies
 to mitigate economic volatility, allow the diversification of the exporting nonoil sector, while maintaining
 adequate fiscal space to invest in market-based stimulus programs and protect vulnerable workers.
 Medium-term policies should concentrate on advancing the economy’s structural transformation to create
 high-quality jobs and establish the necessary conditions to absorb the larger number of new workers
 entering the labor market over the coming decade.

B. Macroeconomic Policies and Structural Reforms
Assessment of fiscal and debt policies
The fiscal policy          To support economic growth, the government has maintained an
stance remained            accommodative fiscal policy in recent years. A series of economic-support
accommodative in           measures have also focused on stimulating domestic demand by: (i)
support of                 increasing pensions and other social transfers; (ii) providing subsidies to
domestic demand.           SOEs and SMEs; and, more recently, (iii) extending support to the banking
                           sector (to be implemented in 2017). While the overall fiscal deficit narrowed
                           from 7.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.3 percent in 2016, the nonoil deficit
                           remained elevated at 10.2 percent of GDP in 2016, 2 percentage points above
                           its pre-crisis level (Table 3, Figure 5).

The government            Currently, the oil price level required for the government budget to achieve a
should consider           balanced position is approximately twice the current oil price (Brent) of about
fiscal                    US$55 per barrel. As a result, there will be a further deterioration in the net
consolidation.            fiscal reserve position—undermining medium-term fiscal sustainability—if
                          the government continues to maintain the elevated nonoil deficit. A simple
                          simulation shows that the stock of net financial assets may be fully depleted
                          (that is, Oil Fund FX assets will be equal to total government debt) by 2020 if
                          the government maintains the nonoil deficit at about 9 percent of GDP in
                          2018-20. To restore fiscal sustainability, the government should urgently
                          adopt a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, including measures to
                          increase nonoil revenue and streamline nonproductive public spending.


Assessment of monetary policy
The central bank          In 2016 the NBK began easing monetary policy, which had been sharply
eased monetary            tightened to stabilize the FX market, as the floating exchange rate regime
policy as                 proved effective and expectations of a devaluation subsided in the second
inflationary              quarter. Since May 2016, the NBK gradually has lowered its base rate—from
pressures                 17 to 11 percent—and narrowed the rate band (Figure 7). Since the fourth
subsided.                 quarter of 2016, a weakening of inflationary pressures (as described above)
                          has been the main driver in the NBK’s decision to ease monetary policy.
The interest-rate         The NBK introduced new instruments of open market operations and
transmission              standing facilities to improve the interest-rate transmission mechanism. It
mechanism is              also expanded the list of eligible collateral for open market operations. To
improving.                enhance the government securities market and its role for the transmission
                          mechanism, the NBK began building a reliable risk-free yield curve in the 2-5-
                          year maturity segment. These efforts positively influenced the money market,
                          with interest rates declining and their volatility decreasing substantially
                          (Figure 8).

The authorities             The implementation of the inflation-targeting regime remains a priority of the
should continue             NBK. A functional inflation-targeting regime requires an effective interest-
transitioning to a          rate transmission channel that signals changes in monetary conditions to
fully-functional            market participants and thereby influences economic activity. To improve the
inflation-targeting         effectiveness of monetary policy, the NBK should continue to enhance its
regime.                     policy framework by further strengthening the interest-rate transmission
                            channel, build a reliable yield curve with the Ministry of Finance and improve
                            its external communication of policy changes. Maintaining flexibility of the
                            exchange rate is also vital for fostering de-dollarization of the economy and
                            increasing the effectiveness of the interest-rate transmission mechanism.

Judicial reforms           Although much work remains to close efficiency and transparency gaps,
are progressing            justice sector reforms have begun to generate initial results. Since the
slowly.                    introduction of a three-tier judicial system in 2016, the time to consider a case
                           has been reduced by half with more than 82 percent of cases resolved at an
                           initial hearing. A new Civil Procedural Code, which took effect in January
                           2016, has steadily increased the number of cases resolved using summary
                           procedures and alternative dispute resolution measures. By assigning the role
                           of the first instance court on investment disputes to the Astana City Court
                           system—and the newly-created, specialized judicial collegium at the Supreme
                           Court as the first instance court for large investors—Kazakhstan has also
                           made an important step towards better resolution of investment disputes.
                           The next priority will be to strengthen the capacity of investment court judges
                           to analyze complex investment cases.

Efforts to improve         Kazakhstan’s ease of doing business ranking has improved in recent years,
the business               but there is scope for additional progress. Kazakhstan rose by 16 positions in
environment                the World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business ranking, to 35 of 190 economies
remain legislative-        globally. Significant improvements were also made on individual indicators,
centric.                   including dealing with construction permits (ranked 22 globally), registering
                           property (18), protecting minority investors (3) and enforcing contracts (9).
                           Progress in the remaining six indicators was marginal. Key constraints
                           remain, including an unreliable transport infrastructure, energy shortages
                           and weaknesses in the banking system. Preliminary findings of the sub-
                           national Doing Business assessment indicate that there is a disconnect
                           between the reference point of Almaty—that has the most business-friendly
                           regulation—and the other regions covered in the assessment. Despite
                           improvements in legislation, implementation problems persist.

Progress on                President Nazarbayev has ordered the government to accelerate the
privatization is           implementation of the privatization program in order to complete it before
being undermined           the end of 2018. The program seeks to privatize (either fully or partially)
by low                     more than 780 state-controlled entities between 2016 and 2018 (Table 4). An
transparency and           estimated revenue from privatization ranges from $4 to $7 billion, the main
poor                       source of which will be privatization of state-owned national
implementation.            holdings/companies. Those entities in the privatization list that are not sold
                           (if auctioned at least three times) will be subject for liquidation. The president
                           has been critical of the slow progress on privatizations and encouraged the
                           government to improve the transparency and efficiency of the program. As
                           part of these efforts, the president instructed the government to transform
                           and reorganize three national holding companies, Samruk-Kazyna, Baiterek
                           and KazAgro. Under the privatization plan, ten large companies owned by
                           Samruk-Kazyna will be publicly listed via an initial public offering facility.5 To
                           prepare SOEs for privatization, timetables and road maps for each entity must
                           be developed and approved. As of end-April 2017, the government reviewed
                           and approved road maps of 754 SOEs (out of 784 in the privatization list).




5 These include KazMunayGas oil and gas company, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy railway operator, Kazatomprom nuclear
company, Kazpost national operator of postal network, AirAstana national air carrier, as well as 5 companies belonging to
Samruk-Energy.

C. Economic Outlook and Risks
Global economic prospects
Global economic    Global economic growth is projected to recover after slowing in 2016, but
growth will remain only gradually, from 2.4 percent in the last year to 2.7 percent in 2017 and 2.9
subdued.           percent in 2018. Global economic activity is suffering from low investment,
                   slow productivity growth and heightened policy uncertainty. Emerging
                   market and developing economies (EMDEs) will see a recovery that is largely
                   driven by increases in commodity prices and continued firm domestic
                   demand in commodity importers. Heightened levels of policy uncertainty in
                   major advanced economies and some EMDEs—as well as weakening
                   investment—represent the main downside risks to global growth.
                   Nonetheless, fiscal stimulus and other growth-enhancing policies in key
                   advanced economies may boost global growth rates above expectations. US
                   economic policies and performance will have a considerable bearing on the
                   overall outcome.

The global trade            Average GDP growth in Kazakhstan’s main trading partners is expected to

remain.                     Furthermore, although global trade growth accelerated in the second half of
                            2016—driven in part by strong import demand from EMDEs—and this trend

Kazakhstan’s baseline scenario, risks and challenges
Kazakhstan will             Kazakhstan’s economic activity is projected to pick up gradually over the
benefit from the oil        medium term, but the GDP growth rate will remain well below its 2014 level,
price recovery and          when the oil price shock hit the economy. Real GDP is projected to grow by
higher oil output,          about 3 percent annually in 2017-19, reducing the poverty rate to a level of
as well as from             about 17 percent by 2019 (Table 5). A projected increase in oil prices will
banking sector              drive growth, supported by increased oil production, as rising output at the
reforms.                    Kashagan offshore oilfield more than offsets declining output from older
                            oilfields. As oil prices are projected to be lower than the pre-crisis levels, the
                            current account and fiscal deficits will persist. In the sort-term, the
                            government’s fiscal position is expected to deteriorate due to the banking
                            sector support package. If implemented properly, timely measures to
                            strengthen banking supervision, resolve serious capital weaknesses in the
                            largest banks in a transparent and accountable way, and work out distressed

policy.                will allow the central bank to focus on inflation targeting. Going forward, the
                       flexible exchange rate regime will help the economy to better absorb external
                       shocks. As the inflationary pass-through effect of the recent currency
                       depreciation fades, real wages and consumer purchasing power are expected
                       to improve. This may help accelerate a reduction in poverty, although at a
                       much slower pace than in previous years.
The medium-term        Downside risks to Kazakhstan’s economic outlook include the potential
growth outlook is      weakening of the external environment, institutional capacity constraints and
subject to             the loss of reform momentum. The economy’s vulnerability to external shocks
downside risks,        remains the major source of risk to medium-term growth and poverty
both external and      reduction. The anticipated political transition, including the ongoing
domestic.              constitutional reform process intended to rebalance the distribution of power
                       in the country, may slow the transition to a new development model aimed at
                       promoting more sustainable and inclusive growth. The successful
                       implementation of the institutional and structural reforms included in the
                       100 Steps program will be vital to strengthen public institutions and improve
                       the quality of human capital. If successfully implemented, these reforms will
                       likely contribute to improved living standards, poverty reduction and shared
                       prosperity.
To achieve its long-   Kazakhstan’s desire for an economic transformation to more sustainable and
term goals,            inclusive growth will require that the authorities: (i) complete the
Kazakhstan has to      macroeconomic adjustment, including through reducing the nonoil fiscal
set the foundations    deficit and continuing to implement inflation targeting; (ii) address the legacy
for a new growth       of SOEs and financial sector issues; and (iii) look at sector-specific public
model based on         investments and policy changes that encourage a more dynamic, export-
dynamic tradable       oriented and productive private sector participation and FDI in agriculture,
sectors.               manufacturing, mining, and transport and logistics, among others. These
                       investments into tradable sectors would enable the Kazakhstani industry to
                       either directly respond to global and domestic market signals or indirectly
                       enable producers to plug into global value chains. The government considers
                       agriculture as one of key tradable sectors with a strong potential for growth,
                       particularly with greater export-oriented private sector participation.


D. Focus Section: Agriculture as a Potential Growth Driver
       The agriculture sector comprises an important piece of Kazakhstan’s push to diversify
       its economy and generate employment. President Nazarbayev named agriculture “a
       new driver of the economy” in his 2017 address to the nation, the Modernization 3.0.
       Indeed, Kazakhstan has tremendous potential to raise rural incomes, create jobs and
       contribute to economic diversification by improving the competitiveness of its
       agriculture sector and adding additional value to output through processing. There are
       also significant opportunities to increase labor productivity in agriculture—which
       remains below that of Russia and Belarus—and to employ unutilized land, which
       represents almost 15 percent of the arable land area and an undetermined area of
       Kazakhstan’s rangelands. Kazakhstan is geographically well located to serve growing
       traditional markets in the region as well as new markets in China, India and the Middle
       East. This, along with the scale of agricultural resources available, makes Kazakhstan a
       potentially attractive investment for domestic and foreign investors.

                                     been remarkably stable since then at about 4.5 percent (Figure 9). The sector
                                     employs nearly one-fifth of the working-age population and, as such, is critical
                                     for addressing food security and poverty reduction. Kazakhstan has a total
                                     cultivated area of 23.48 million hectares (ha) and 181 million ha of rangeland,
                                     one of the largest areas in the world. About 55 percent of the 2.4 million ha
                                     irrigated during the Soviet period is currently in use. Although areas planted
                                     with agricultural crops dropped dramatically in the 1990s (by 20 million ha)
                                     following the withdrawal of low quality feed grain areas, the cropped area has
                                     increased by about 6 million ha since then.

dominates                            than half of total output and nearly three quarters of total milk and meat

                                     of grain production is concentrated in large agricultural enterprises of over
                                     10,000 ha. The three largest holding companies in the northern wheat region
                                     control more than 700,000 ha each and the 15 top holding companies
                                     comprise 35 percent of the region’s sown wheat-growing area. Three poultry
                                     companies control 30 percent of supply to the domestic market. As a
                                     simplified version of agricultural enterprises, individual farms vary
                                     significantly in size. Although they could be as small as a single household,
                                     they represent a formal means of participating in agricultural production. The
                                     share of individual farms in agricultural production has increased over time
                                     and currently surpasses the share of agricultural enterprises (Figure 10).

                                 not always most-efficient and well-targeted. Funds have also been channeled
                                 to the sector through the national holding, KazAgro, which was established in
                                 2006 and uses charter capital for various subsidy and credit programs
                                 through its subsidiary organizations. Government support to the agriculture
                                 sector increased in 2006 and has remained at an elevated level (Figure 11).
                                 Indeed, total subsidies, credits and transfers to KazAgro represented more
                                 than 80 percent of the Ministry of Agriculture’s budget in 2016; water

                                 increases in livestock and investment subsidies as well as a capital increase
                                 for KazAgro, most likely for credit provision (Figure 12).

Despite support to                   Despite an increase in agricultural production and large injections of

balance remains                      The overall volume of agro-food trade increased notably in the mid-2000s
negative.                            with erratic increases in exports of wheat and flour and increases in imports
                                     of dairy, sugar and processed food products. With regards to markets,
                                     however, trade has diversified somewhat, through a decline in the share of
                                     exports to Russia and an increase in the share of exports to Afghanistan,
                                     Central Asia, Turkey, the Middle East and Egypt. The agro-food trade deficit
                                     peaked in 2011 but has slowly fallen since then as import spending has fallen
                                     owing to a depreciation of the tenge (Figure 13).

                              While the government’s Agro-Industrial Development Program 2017-2021
                              recognizes the significance of the agro-food industry, it lacks sufficient detail
                              on practical ways to support the industry’s development. Specific measures
                              and policies could include special funds to leverage private investment in the
                              industry and boost investors’ confidence such as standards of production
                              facility as well as financial access, guarantee and insurance support schemes.
The focus on                  Among the most risk-prone sectors in Central Asian economies, agricultural
research,                     production has serious limitations as climatic conditions are unfavorable, the
innovation and                domestic market is small, and the country is landlocked. The legacy of a
education in                  centrally planned economy left yields low across major agricultural
agriculture should            commodities (Figure 14); producers find it difficult to sustain the average
help to increase              yield levels, as about a third of the yield variance in agricultural production is
productivity.                 driven by climate conditions, compared to only 5 percent of the variance in
                              the EU. Faced with these obstacles, the primary means of raising agricultural
                              output should be through productivity growth that is based on research,
                              innovation, dissemination and the adoption of appropriate technologies.
                              However, the fundamental gap in the support program is that research and
                              development (R&D) and other science-related expenditures are not high on
                              the agenda of policy makers and are not reflected in important policy and
                              technical documents. Science-related government expenditures have been
                              stagnant in recent years and the share of the Ministry of Agriculture’s budget
                              committed to agricultural research and development is extremely small
                              (Figure 15). This is partly due to efficiency concerns as a clear link has not
                              been established between applied research and actual production. At the
                              same time, an important source of R&D—the private sector—is currently not
                              present in Kazakhstan in general (an in agriculture in particular); its future
                              will depend on whether market-based structure and a supportive business
                              environment makes it feasible for larger investors to come into the sector.

                                         Allowing the sub-leasing of land could be a useful approach to raise the
                                         potential for an efficient use of this resource, as the absence of an established
                                         land market is a serious constraint to productive agriculture and limits its
                                         ability to attract medium and long term financing. Furthermore, FDI in

                                         Particular attention should be given to reducing investment-entry constraints
                                         (such as the provision of various licenses and permits) and investor-

                                         of investor grievances). These constraints are exacerbated by a perceived lack

Access to finance                        In a recently-published World Bank report, “Enabling the Business of
also remains an                          Agriculture 2017,” Kazakhstan scored poorly in the areas of transport (55 out
important agenda                         of 62) and finance (50 out of 62) for agro-business, underscoring the serious
to address.                              constraints the sector is facing in both areas. Agricultural productivity
                                         depends heavily on public investment in rural roads, utilities and
                                         communications; productivity declines significantly where travel time to
                                         markets exceeds four hours. For farms serving export markets, improved rail
                                         and port facilities will be important; for farms serving domestic markets,
                                         better secondary roads will be needed. Such investments can take the form of
                                         public-private partnerships to encourage increased private investment in
                                         storage, distributional infrastructure and processing facilities.

                                         Furthermore, although subsidized credits from government resources are
                                         available, access to finance remains limited for most small and many medium-
                                         size farmers. The recently-announced government policy of gradually
                                         phasing out direct crediting of agricultural producers by state-owned

      enterprises (subsidiaries of KazAgro) while increasing wholesale funding of
      second tier banks and other financial intermediaries is commendable, as it
      should allow producers to leverage private financial resources. However,
      experience from different regions demonstrates that the biggest increase in
      access to finance for farmers can be achieved through the development of
      commercial relationships between small farmers and the food industry as
      these can provide significant finance to small farmers through structural
      financing.
