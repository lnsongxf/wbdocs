x Converting Biomass to Energy: A Guide for Developers and Investors
FOREWORD



Biomass can become a reliable and renewable local energy source to replace conventional fossil fuels in local industries
and to reduce reliance on overloaded electricity grids. In this perspective, many medium-to-large agricultural, wood
processing, or food processing industries in developing countries and emerging economies are well placed to benefit
from the successful development of biomass-to-energy.

The International Finance Corporation presents this guide as a practical tool for developers of and investors
in biomass-to-energy projects. The target audience is medium-to-large agricultural, food and beverage, or wood
processing companies in developing countries. Most likely, they have a biomass resource on-site in the form
of a byproduct or waste from their core business that may be used for energy production and hence used to replace
existing energy sources.

The development of a biomass-to-energy project requires careful preparation, and it is hoped that this guide will help
project developers and investors prepare successful projects, adopting industry best practices in the development,
construction, operation, and financing of biomass-to-energy projects. To facilitate this, the guide provides reference
knowledge for key types of biomass-to-energy projects on technical, financial, and environmental aspects as well
as issues related to grid access, offtake agreements, biomass availability, sustainability, and the supply chain.

This guide is written mainly for developers and investors in energy production from bio-waste generated from the
agricultural, food and beverage processing, and wood processing sectors in developing countries and emerging
economies. However, much of the technical content is equally relevant to broader applications and is likely to be
helpful to readers who are keen on deepening their understanding of the biomass-to-energy sector.

We hope that you find this guide useful.

residues from the forestry and agricultural sectors. In this
case, there may not be an existing industrial facility to use

be an industry owning, for example, fields for sugarcane

Case Story: Biomass Project for the Paper Industry in Pakistan

                                           PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                           The large paper manufacturer Bulleh Shah Packaging Ltd., in Kasur, near Lahore in
                                           Punjab, Pakistan, has commissioned a new biomass power plant based mainly on wheat
                                           straw, corn stover, and cotton stalks. The new biomass boiler substitutes an existing
                                           fossil fuel-fired boiler, but natural gas/oil is still used for startup and as auxiliary fuel.
                                           The new power plant, commissioned in 2015, is reducing Bulleh Shah’s operating costs
                                           by substituting fuel oil and gas with biomass. The plant contributes to the region’s
                                           economic development, as it uses locally grown biomass residues, available in large
                                           quantities, as fuel. Furthermore, the new biomass-fired plant is reducing the carbon
                                           dioxide emissions.
                                           The integration between the new biomass boiler and the existing power plant has been
                                           thoroughly investigated to find an optimal size of the new boiler together with the
                                           existing steam turbine and the process steam consumption.
                                           Based on the conceptual design, a bankable feasibility study for external financing was
                                           carried out, followed by the overall design, tender specifications, contract negotiations,
                                           and finalizing of the turnkey contract.

                                           APPLIED TECHNOLOGY
                                           The project includes a new biomass boiler, a new flue gas cleaning system, and civil
                                           construction.
                                           The grate-type boiler is equipped with a steam superheater for the turbine, a feed-
                                           water economizer, and an air preheater.
                                           The flue gas from the boiler is cleaned for dust emissions in the baghouse filter, located
                                           prior to the stack.

                                           PLANT PERFORMANCE
                                           The plant capacity is 120 MWth, and the plant generates up to 35 MWe electricity in
                                           addition to process steam for the paper mill.
                                           The capacity of the grate-fired boiler unit is 150 tons of steam per hour, 525oC, 100 bar.

                                           FUEL TYPE AND HANDLING
                                           The plant is designed for a variety of biomass fuels such as wheat straw, corn stover,
                                           cotton stalks, and rice straw and husk.
                                           The power plant includes outdoor fuel storage (bales), shredding facilities (maximum
                                           particle size of 100 millimeters), indoor storage with shredded fuel for automatic

The maintenance cost for BFB boilers is normally considered
to be high as the refractory in the bed and at the boiler walls
requires regular maintenance and the bed technology requires
a relatively high primary air pressure that is costly. Further
bed material (sand) needs to be added continually, and hence
the ash residue amount is high and generates costs.

                                                       PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                                       Bentong Biomass Plant is a privately owned energy plant located in Pahang, Malaysia, a
                                                       region where many industries using natural resources are gathered.
                                                       The plant is fired with waste products from nearby industries, thereby making use of
                                                       waste products for energy production. Two types of fuel are used: wood chips and
                                                       empty fruit bunches. The wood chips are left over from furniture production that takes
                                                       place at a nearby plant. The empty fruit bunches are residues from palm oil production,
                                                       after the palm oil has been extracted.
                                                       Both waste products are pretreated upon arrival at the Bentong plant. Both fuel types
                                                       are shredded to obtain a homogenous size, which enables smoother operation of the
                                                       plant and the combustion process.
                                                       Bentong Biomass Plant produces steam, which is sold to a nearby paper factory 24

                                                       the paper factory has secured the biomass plant a guaranteed price for steam, while
                                                       securing the paper factory a guaranteed rate of supplied steam.
                                                       The plant is shut down for maintenance one to three times per year for one to three

                                                       plant was commissioned in 2007 and is staffed by three shifts of six operators each.
                                                       The plant was built by a Malaysian contractor specializing in biomass plants and using

This section describes the different measures available
for reducing emissions from the combustion of biomass.
The emissions can be reduced by either primary measures
(combustion process integrated measures) or secondary
measures (post-combustion cleaning).

PRIMARY MEASURES

The primary measures improve the combustion process
and minimize the production of pollutants. A combustion
temperature above 850°C for at least 1.5 seconds secures a
complete combustion; lower temperatures or lower residence
time increase the emissions of complex hydrocarbons (tars),
carbon monoxide, etc.

If the combustion air is preheated and the moisture content
in the fuel is less than 50 to 60 percent, an adequate          Measures to enhance the combustion process are

 Case Story: Biomass Project for the Wood Processing Industry in Turkey

                                                 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                                 Kastamonu Entegre is a large integrated company specialized in the production of
                                                 wood-based panels (particle board and MDF). In its facility in Gebze (in northwestern
                                                 Turkey), the company burns wood residues from its own production in order to use the
                                                 heat, mainly for thermal-oil presses and dryers.
                                                 Because the company had a surplus of both biomass and thermal capacity in the
                                                 existing boilers, it decided to install an ORC unit in order to produce electricity. The
                                                 plant startup occurred in 2014.

                                                 APPLIED TECHNOLOGY
                                                 The company decided to install a Turboden 10-CHP unit, which produces both
                                                 electricity and hot water at 90°C.
                                                 The input of the unit is hot oil at about 300°C (about 5.5 MWh thermal). The oil circuit
                                                 was already present in the facility (used mainly for the presses), so the company
                                                 installed a three-way valve to redirect part of the flow to ORC heat exchangers.

                                                 PLANT PERFORMANCE
                                                 Outputs of the ORC unit:

ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATORS
                                                                   Figure 5-23: Detail of an Electrostatic Precipitator
An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) (see Figure 5–23) is a
particle control device that uses electrical forces to move the
particles out of the flue gas stream and onto collector plates.


In the ESP, the particles are given an electrical charge by
forcing them to pass through a corona, a region in which
gaseous ions flow. The electrical field that forces the charged
particles to the walls comes from electrodes maintained at
high voltage in the center of the flow lane.


Once the particles are collected on the plates, they must be
removed from the plates without re-entraining them into            Source: Egmason, Wikipedia, 2016.

is rather poor as the available space (on each particle) for
electron charges is limited. An ESP is therefore mediocre for
aerosol particles, although better than a multicyclone.


The resistivity of the dust particles should be neither too
low nor too high. If the resistivity is too low, the particles
lose their charges when they hit the collecting plate and will
re-entrain back into the gas stream. If the resistivity is too
high, the particles will not be charged at all and therefore
will not be affected by the electric field.

BAGHOUSE FILTERS

A baghouse filter (see Figure 5–24) contains bags of textiles
or membrane-coated textiles through which the flue gas
passes and leaves a layer of dust to accumulate on the filter
media surface. When sufficient pressure drop is reached, the
cleaning process begins.

Plant material from different types of production: Plant
material may be grass, straw from grain, and fibers from
sugar cane, palm, and other plants. This biomass needs
pretreatment before it can be used in a biogas plant. It will
be sufficient to grind the grass into a pulp. Because straw
and fibers contain cellulose, which is difficult for the bacteria
to use, this material must first be cut into small pieces and
then heated or mechanically treated in a mill, extruder, or
similar. This will open the cellulose to the bacteria in the
digester. This type of biomass is difficult and demanding to
handle before biogas production can begin.

Case Story: Biomass Project for Sale to the Grid in Armenia

                                       PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                       Armenia has few natural resources but has inherited serious ecological problems from
                                       the Soviet era. The country is highly dependent on imports of energy supplies, mainly
                                       from Russia. Five Armenian plants produce electricity: two thermal power plants (using
                                       gas from Russia), a nuclear power plant (using nuclear fuel from Russia), and two
                                       hydropower plants (using local water sources).
                                       Lusakert Pedigree Poultry Plant (LPPP) houses on average 2.5 million animals. The
                                       manure from the poultry is collected and spread into a system of five anaerobic
                                       throughflow stabilization lagoons where the manure settles. Greenhouse gases are
                                       produced from the manure.
                                       LPPP is located in Nor Geghi village, 24 kilometers from Yerevan in the Kotayk Region.
                                       The objective of the Lusakert Biogas Project is to reduce water pollution, secure an
                                       improved and reliable power supply, produce heat, produce fertilizer, and reduce climate-
                                       altering emissions, thereby facilitating future sustainable economic growth in Armenia.

                                       APPLIED TECHNOLOGY
                                       The total investment cost for the Lusakert Biogas Project is around €3 million. Training
                                       of both management and staff was included in the project.
                                       All equipment is installed in containers. The manure is diluted with some 150 cubic meters
                                       of water per day to obtain a dry solid content of 10 to 11 percent before it is pumped to the
                                       digester. The manure is heated in the heat exchanger before it reaches the digester. The
                                       digester is operated mesophilic at 380°C, and the hydraulic retention time is 20 days.

                                       PLANT PERFORMANCE
                                       Some 24,000 kilograms of manure from digested sewage sludge are produced per day, and
                                       the digester is loaded with 250 cubic meters of manure per day. Daily production of 15,000
                                       kilograms of dry solid digested manure is expected. The digested manure is used as fertilizer.
                                       The gas is used to produce electricity and heat. The emission savings are some 26,370
                                       tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per year, based on the estimated yearly gas production.
                                       The biogas is burned in a CHP unit to produce electricity and heat. The biogas production
                                       is 5,500 normal cubic meters of methane per day. The plant produces some 6.3 MWh of
                                       electricity per year and some 4.8 MWh of heat per year.

                                       OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT
                                       The project is a success, based on the following achievements:
                                       •	 Significant reduction in the production of greenhouse gases
                                       •	 Stable green electricity production
                                       •	 Heat for the digester and to heat the production houses
                                       •	 Fertilizer for a fruit plantation
                                       •	 Significant reduction in pollution of the recipient water.
                                       Other beneficiaries of the project include the plant workers and others who benefit from
                                       the improved environmental situation around the lagoons at the plant. Furthermore, the
                                       drinking water below the lagoons will not be affected by pollution from manure leaking
                                       to the groundwater.

                                       IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED
                                       •	 It is important to secure a stable delivery of biomass to the digester.
                                       •	 It is advised to prepare the project for alternative biomass types.
                                       •	 Training should be sufficient to ensure optimized operation of the plant.

In the scoping phase, relevant technological alternatives and
alternative locations will be selected, so they can be assessed
in parallel with the project in the ESIA. As part of the scoping
phase, it might be advantageous to hold a scoping workshop
that includes the project owner and the main stakeholders.


The scoping report will define the Terms of Reference
for the ESIA study.

                                                           PROJECT DESCRIPTION
                                                           Gildan is a leading Canadian multinational company that manufactures high-quality
                                                           basic clothing, with production facilities in the Dominican Republic and Honduras.
                                                           Its industrial activity requires a high saturated steam flow. This used to be produced
                                                           by heavy oil boilers, which drove the company to face high energy costs and resulted
                                                           in a larger carbon footprint.
                                                           In the Rio Nance plant in Honduras, Gildan produces 150 tons per hour of vapor using
                                                           six boilers of 25 tons per hour each.

112 Operation and Maintenance of Biomass Plants
STAFF

The staff at a biogas plant is limited to three to six persons,
depending on the plant size. Since operation is fully
automatic, the plant is only manned between 6 a.m. and 6
p.m. On weekends, there is normally no staff, but the alarm
system will call for support if there is a breakdown or other
irregularities at the biogas plant.


The staff consist of a plant manager and operators. At
large biogas plants, a process specialist may be employed to
supervise the mixing of biomass types, optimization of the
operation, etc.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE MANUALS

Each plant should have a set of operation and maintenance
manuals. These are the basis for maintenance of the plant
since they include information on each component at the
plant, such as the pumping capacity, power demand, when
oil shall be changed, which type of oil is needed, etc.

Box 10-1: Calculating Biomass-to-Energy Versus Existing Use of Coal

  Before investing in the retrofitting of a coal power plant to accommodate co-firing with biomass, it is essential to clarify the
  financial viability of such an investment. The following calculations provide an indicative estimate of the costs per MWh
  related to co-firing compared to business as usual. It becomes clear that the investment is financially viable only if there are
  financial incentives such as a carbon dioxide tax and clean energy certificates (CEC).
  The business-as-usual scenario is electricity generation based on coal firing. This scenario applies no additional CAPEX or OPEX,
  and thus the price per MWh consists only of the costs of coal and the related tax on carbon dioxide emissions for comparison
  purposes.
  The scenario of co-firing with biomass adds a few elements to the equation. First, there is the price of the biomass, including
  collection and transport. Then, there is the additional CAPEX and OPEX due to the retrofitting of the power plant. Finally,
  there is the CEC incentive, which is intended to outweigh the additional costs of using biomass for energy generation.

  Without the CEC, the co-firing solution is significantly more expensive than the business-as-usual scenario. However, including
  the CEC, the total cost of the co-firing solution becomes lower than the business-as-usual scenario, indicating that, subject
  to the assumptions, a co-firing solution is financially viable and a sound investment.
  Therefore, project developers should, at an early stage of the project development process, seek to identify and understand
  the specific regulatory framework in place for biomass-to-energy in their country and region.

The key elements to ensure that the biomass project is
financially sustainable are:


 •	 A secure and stable supply of quality biomass feedstock
   is available.

 •	 There is easy access to a stable market for the produced
   electricity and/or heat.

 •	 Available biomass volumes are sufficient to justify the
   technology and scale of operation.

 Box 13-1: Example Case of Financial Analysis (Fictional Data)

   A cooperation of farmers in Kenya produces 15,000 tons of corn residuals and 30,000 tons of wood residuals per year.
   This case exemplifies the financial analysis of an investment in a medium-scale conversion plant with a grate boiler.
   Assumptions
   Transport costs are not included in the analysis.
   Electricity is sold at $0.20 per kWh, whereas the process heat is used at a local industry, saving them $0.06 per kWh.
   The plant constructed has an annual capacity of 50,000 tons of biomass and an energy production capacity of 120,000
   gigajoules (output).
   The project is financed with equal parts of debt and equity raised by the cooperation of farmers. The debt has an interest rate
   of 12 percent, a 1 percent financing fee, and a maturity of 10 years. The required return on equity is assumed to be 15 percent.
   Results
   The financial result of the project is a net present value of $77 million with an internal rate of return of 28 percent.
   The simple payback period of the project is slightly more than five years.
   The energy conversion reduces the carbon dioxide emission from other energy production, corresponding to 65,000 tons
   of carbon dioxide.

   Calculation of LCOE
   The NPV of the total costs of the project
   amount to $120 million and a discounted
   electricity output of 283 million kWh. The
   LCOE where the project NPV breaks even is
   therefore $0.018 per kWh of electricity.

      to fund new technologies. The majority of private equity funds consist of institutional investors and accredited investors,

Mitigation measures vary depending on the type of
risk. Therefore, financial modeling, including sensitivity
analysis, should be performed to reveal the effects of the
risks identified. Early engagement with potential financing
partners will facilitate the later access to finance, as it
may identify issues that are better addressed upfront in
the project design. Table 14–1 presents the key risks for
a biomass-to-energy project as well as suggestions for
mitigation measures.

Table 14-1: Assumptions for Economic Analysis
Risk                                  Mitigation Strategy
Biomass availability                  The project company should own the biomass resource, thereby controlling the supply, or
                                      biomass supply contracts with external suppliers should be in place.
Energy offtake security               If the project company cannot utilize the power, a power purchase agreement with, for
                                      example, a power utility company, should be in place.
Construction costs                    To mitigate the risks of exceeding the planned construction costs, a high-quality feasibility
                                      study should be conducted in advance, as illustrated in Figure 2–3 in Chapter 2.
Operational performance               To ensure that the plant operates as expected, the project developer should choose a
                                      proven technology and reliable suppliers under best-practice contracts.
Financial viability                   To ensure financial viability, the security of biomass supply at a known and reasonable
                                      price must be in place, as should the security of energy sale at a known and reasonable
                                      price. A way to secure a fixed price for the energy is via feed-in tariffs.
General political risk                The risks of shifting political focus could be reduced by partial risk guarantees.
Sector-specific regulatory risks      Government endorsement of biomass-to-energy projects has great importance if the
                                      projects’ financial viability depends on, for example, subsidies or feed-in tariffs. The
                                      government may eventually change the regulation retroactively, thus affecting signed
                                      power purchase agreements. The developer should assess the sustainability of the
                                      regulatory framework and the energy customer’s ability to pay.
Environmental and social risks        To avoid environmental and social risks, international best practice should be adopted,
                                      and these aspects should be covered in a high-quality feasibility study.

 Box 15-1: Examples of Environmental and Social Impacts of Biomass Projects

   A biomass plant project is developed to use agricultural residues, such as straw, for electricity production. This could have
   a number of environmental impacts, such as:
   •	 Air quality: Emissions from combustion of bio-residues can lead to air pollution.
     Nutrients: Removal of residues from the agricultural ecosystem can lead to depletion of nutrients in soil if the ashes are
   •	
     not returned to the soil.
     Biodiversity: If demand for residues increase beyond supply, new agricultural areas can be created from conversion of,
   •	
     for example, wetlands, shrub land, or forest, which can negatively impact biodiversity.
     Water: Both water quality and quantity can be affected, for example by discharge of wastewater or increased use of
   •	
     groundwater for production of biomass.
     Land: If only secondary resources are used, local impacts on land are probably small. However, if other users already utilize
   •	
     the feedstocks, environmental consequences could arise if these users pursue other feedstocks.

   A number of social consequences also can arise from the development of biomass plants, such as:
   •	 Employment: The bioenergy plant can generate employment in the region.
   •	 Economy: The plant can benefit the local economy.
     Food security: Depending on existing uses of the feedstock, potential food security issues can arise if food or feed crops
   •	
     are used for energy generation.

   While not exhaustive, this list provides a brief overview of potential impacts and shows that a number of these
   (positive and negative impacts) should be considered when developing biomass projects.

  Tools Available and Reporting
  Seeking co-financing for a biomass project from international financial institutions such as IFC will require an Environmental
  and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). The ESIA assesses the potential environmental and social risks and impacts that are likely
  to arise from the activities of the project. The ESIA is the framework for screening and understanding environmental and social
  aspects of the project.
  Some tools already exist for project developers who are interested in gaining further information on a framework for
  environmental and social screening. These tools include guidance for project developers on the typical environmental and social
  issues pertaining to biomass projects and on the process of assessing them and identifying mitigation measures.

 Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts (PS1)
 Introduction     PS1 underscores the importance of identifying environmental and social risks and impacts, and managing
                  these according to an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) throughout the lifetime of a project.
                  ESMS entails a methodological approach to managing environmental and social risks and impacts
                  in a structured way on an ongoing basis.
 Objectives       •	 To identify and evaluate environmental and social risks and impacts of the project.
                  •	 To adopt a mitigation hierarchy to anticipate and avoid, or where avoidance is not possible, minimize and, where
                     residual impacts remain, compensate/offset for risks and impacts to workers, affected communities,
                     and the environment.
                  •	 To promote improved environmental and social performance of clients through the effective use of management
                     systems.
                  •	 To ensure that grievances from affected communities and external communications from other stakeholders are
                     responded to and managed appropriately.
                  •	 To promote and provide means for adequate engagement with affected communities throughout the project
                     cycle on issues that could potentially affect them and to ensure that relevant environmental and social
                     information is disclosed and disseminated.
 Requirements     •	 Conduct, if necessary in coordination with government agencies, a process of environmental and social
                     assessment, and establish and maintain an ESMS appropriate to the nature and scale of the project and
                     commensurate with the level of its environmental and social risks and impacts.
                  •	 The ESMS will incorporate the following elements:
                    •	 Policy
                    •	 Identification of risks and impacts
                    •	 Management programs
                    •	 Organizational capacity and competency
                    •	 Emergency preparedness and response
                    •	 Stakeholder engagement
                    •	 Monitoring and review.
 Questions        •	 Has a process for identifying the environmental and social risks and impacts of the project been established and
                     measures to ensure its implementation and maintenance enacted?
                  •	 Have all relevant stakeholders been identified and consulted in relation to project development? This includes
                     local, national, and international organizations that are likely to have an interest in the project.
                  •	 Have stakeholder expectations been clarified? Have areas where accidents and emergency situations may occur
                     been identified? Is there an emergency preparedness and response system/plan?
                  •	 Does the project negatively affect local communities in the project’s area of influence?
                  •	 How will potential conflicts be resolved? Is there a grievance redressal mechanism?
                  •	 Could the project cause migration or otherwise displace people?
 Labor and Working Conditions (PS2)
 Introduction     PS2 recognizes that the pursuit of economic growth through employment creation and income generation should
                  be accompanied by protection of the fundamental rights of workers.
 Objectives       •	 To promote the fair treatment, non-discrimination, and equal opportunity of workers.
                  •	 To establish, maintain, and improve the worker-management relationship.
                  •	 To promote compliance with national employment and labor laws
                  •	 To protect workers, including vulnerable categories of workers such as children, migrant workers, workers
                     engaged by third parties, and workers in the client’s supply chain.
                  •	 To promote safe and healthy working conditions, and the health of workers.
                  •	 To avoid the use of forced labor.
 Requirements     •	 Implement policies and procedures relating to Working Conditions and Management of Worker Relationship,
                     Protection of the Work Force, Occupational Health and Safety, and Supply Chain considerations, including Terms
                     of Employment, Workers’ Organizations, Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity, Child and Forced Labor.

                •	 Have an appropriate engagement process and a grievance mechanism been implemented?
                •	 Is there an occupational health and safety management system in place?
Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention (PS3)
Introduction    PS3 recognizes that increased economic activity often generates increased levels of pollution to air, water, and land
                and consumes finite resources in a manner that may threaten people and the environment at the local, regional,
                and global levels.
Objectives      •	 To avoid or minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment by avoiding or minimizing pollution
                   from project activities.
                •	 To promote more sustainable use of resources, including energy and water.
                •	 To reduce project-related greenhouse-gas emissions.
Requirements    •	 Consider ambient conditions and apply technically and financially feasible resource efficiency and pollution
                   prevention principles and techniques that are best suited to avoid, or where avoidance is not possible, minimize
                   adverse impacts on human health and the environment
                •	 The principles and techniques applied during the project lifecycle will be tailored to the hazards and risks
                   associated with the nature of the project and consistent with good international industry practice.
Questions       •	 Could the project development or activities necessary to support the project impact water use, electricity

                   the off-site production of energy used by the project, been quantified?
                •	 Have measures that avoid or reduce water usage been implemented, so that the project’s water consumption
                   does not have significant adverse impacts on the local environment, including affected communities?
                •	 Have measures to avoid the release of air pollutants and wastewater or, when avoidance is not feasible,
                   minimization and/or control of the intensity and mass flow of their release, been implemented?
                •	 Have measures or technical installations to avoid the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste
                   materials been implemented?
                •	 Has an integrated pest management approach, including the use of chemical pesticides, been formulated and
                   implemented? (Relevant only to projects using primary feedstock).
Community Health, Safety, and Security (PS4)
Introduction    PS4 recognizes that project activities, equipment, and infrastructure can increase community exposure to risks
                and impacts.
Objectives      •	 To anticipate and avoid adverse impacts on the health and safety of the affected community during the project
                   life from both routine and non-routine circumstances.
                •	 To ensure that the safeguarding of personnel and property is carried out in accordance with relevant human
                   rights principles and in a manner that avoids or minimizes risks to the affected communities.
Requirements    •	 Evaluate the risks and impacts to the health and safety of the affected communities during the project lifecycle
                   and establish preventive and control measures consistent with good international industry practice.
                                                                                                                              (continued)

 Table 15-2: Overview of Proposed Questions to Screen for Environmental and Social Issues on Biomass-to-Energy
 Projects, based on IFC Performance Standards (continued)
 Community Health, Safety, and Security (PS4) (continued)
 Questions        •	 Could the project negatively affect community social or human capital?
                  •	 Could production of the feedstock in question adversely affect local production of or access to food?
                  •	 Could utilization of the feedstock in question restrict or limit access to energy by local communities
                     and stakeholders?
                  •	 Could the project adversely affect women and girls?
                  •	 Could the project negatively affect disadvantaged and vulnerable groups?
                  •	 Could the use of the feedstock in question negatively affect local agricultural markets, and what are the impacts

                     in the region?
 Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement (PS5)
 Introduction     PS5 recognizes that project-related land acquisition and restrictions on land use can have adverse impacts on
                  communities and persons that use this land. PS5 does not apply to resettlement resulting from voluntary land
                  transactions (i.e., market transactions in which the seller is not obliged to sell and the buyer cannot resort to
                  expropriation or other compulsory procedures sanctioned by the legal system of the host country if negotiations fail).
 Objectives       •	 To avoid, and when avoidance is not possible, minimize displacement by exploring alternative project designs.
                  •	 To avoid forced eviction.
                  •	 To anticipate and avoid, or where avoidance is not possible, minimize adverse social and economic impacts
                     from land acquisition or restrictions on land use by 1) providing compensation for loss of assets at replacement
                     cost and 2) ensuring that resettlement activities are implemented with appropriate disclosure of information,
                     consultation, and the informed participation of those affected.
                  •	 To improve, or restore, the livelihoods and standards of living of displaced persons.
                  •	 To improve living conditions among physically displaced persons through the provision of adequate housing
                     with security of tenure at resettlement sites.
 Requirements     •	 Consider aspects related to Compensation and Benefits for Displaced Persons, Community Engagement, Grievance
                     Mechanism, Resettlement and Livelihood Restoration Planning and Implementation, and Displacement.
 Questions        •	 Can feasible, alternative project designs avoid or minimize physical and/or economic displacement, and have
                     these been considered?
                  •	 Are there risks of resettlement and use of land by stakeholders or affected communities due to project development?
                  •	 If so, has a Resettlement Action Plan that covers, at a minimum, the applicable requirements of this Performance
                     Standard, been developed?

Projects, based on IFC Performance Standards (continued)
Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources (PS6)
Introduction    PS6 recognizes that protecting and conserving biodiversity, maintaining ecosystem services, and sustainably
                managing living natural resources are fundamental to sustainable development.
Objectives      •	 To protect and conserve biodiversity.
                •	 To maintain the benefits from ecosystem services.
                •	 To promote the sustainable management of living natural resources through the adoption of practices that
                   integrate conservation needs and development priorities.
Requirements    •	 Consider direct and indirect project-related impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services and identify any
                   significant residual impacts
                •	 Avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. When avoidance of impacts is not possible, measures to
                   minimize impacts and restore biodiversity and ecosystem services should be implemented.
                •	 If the project involves the utilization of primary biomass resources, certain requirements exist. These are specified
                   in paragraphs 26 through 30 of PS6. Further, if a project relies on purchasing primary production that is known to
                   be produced in regions where there is a risk of significant conversion of natural and/or critical habitats, systems and
                   verification practices will be adopted as part of the client’s ESMS to evaluate its primary suppliers.
Questions       •	 Could the project directly or indirectly significantly convert or degrade natural habitats or ecosystems?
                •	 Have relevant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services, including habitat loss, degradation and
                   fragmentation, invasive alien species, overexploitation, hydrological changes, nutrient loading, and pollution,
                   been considered?
                •	 Have the values (economic and otherwise) attached to biodiversity and ecosystem services by affected
                   communities and other stakeholders been taken into account?
                •	 Have mitigation measures been designed to achieve no net loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services?
                •	 Are there any critical habitats within the area, which the project will affect? Critical habitat areas and/or areas
                   with high biodiversity value, including: 1) habitat of significant importance to critically endangered and/or
                   endangered species; 2) habitat of significant importance to endemic and/or restricted-range species; 3) habitat
                   supporting globally significant concentrations of migratory species and/or congregatory species; 4) highly
                   threatened and/or unique ecosystems; and/or 5) areas associated with key evolutionary processes. If so, PS6
                   outlines a number of considerations that must be adhered to.
                •	 Could the project intentionally or accidentally introduce alien, or non-native, species of flora and fauna into areas
                   where they are not normally found?
                •	 If the project utilizes primary resources, has land-based agribusiness and forestry projects been located on
                   unforested land or land already converted?
Indigenous Peoples (PS7)
Introduction    PS7 recognizes that Indigenous Peoples, as social groups with identities that are distinct from mainstream groups
                in national societies, are often among the most marginalized and vulnerable segments of the population. The fol-
                lowing section only applies of Indigenous Peoples are among the Affected Communities.
Objectives      •	 To ensure that the development process fosters full respect for the human rights, dignity, aspirations, culture,
                   and natural resource-based livelihoods of Indigenous Peoples.
                •	 To anticipate and avoid adverse impacts of projects on communities of Indigenous Peoples, or when avoidance is
                   not possible, to minimize and/or compensate for such impacts.
                •	 To promote sustainable development benefits and opportunities for Indigenous Peoples in a culturally
                   appropriate manner.
                •	 To establish and maintain an ongoing relationship based on Informed Consultation and Participation (ICP) with
                   the Indigenous Peoples affected by a project throughout the project’s lifecycle.
                •	 To ensure the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) of the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples when
                   the circumstances described in this Performance Standard are present.
                •	 To respect and preserve the culture, knowledge, and practices of Indigenous Peoples.
Requirements    •	 Avoid adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples and ensure participation and consent.
                •	 If the project is located on, or seeks to commercially develop natural resources on lands traditionally owned by, or
                   under the customary use of, Indigenous Peoples, and adverse impacts can be expected, specific requirements apply.
                                                                                                                                (continued)

 Table 15-2: Overview of Proposed Questions to Screen for Environmental and Social Issues on Biomass-to-Energy
 Projects, based on IFC Performance Standards (continued)
 Indigenous Peoples (PS7) (continued)
 Questions            •	 Have all communities of Indigenous Peoples within the project area of influence who may be affected by the
                         project been identified?
                      •	 Where adverse impacts are unavoidable, have measures to minimize, restore, and/or compensate for these
                         impacts in a culturally appropriate manner commensurate with the nature and scale of such impacts and
                         the vulnerability of the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples been implemented?
                      •	 Has an engagement process with the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples (as required in PS1)
                         been undertaken?
                      •	 Are there circumstances requiring Free, Prior, and Informed Consent of the Affected Communities
                         of Indigenous Peoples?
                      •	 Have feasible, alternative project designs to avoid the relocation of Indigenous Peoples from communally held
                         lands and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use been considered?
 Cultural Heritage (PS8)
 Introduction         PS8 recognizes the importance of cultural heritage for current and future generations.
 Objectives           •	 To protect cultural heritage from the adverse impacts of project activities and support its preservation.
                      •	 To promote the equitable sharing of benefits from the use of cultural heritage.
 Requirements         •	 To protect Cultural Heritage in Project Design and Execution.
 Questions            •	 Could the project negatively affect community cultural capital?
                      •	 By ensuring that internationally recognized practices for the protection, field-based study, and documentation
                         of cultural heritage are implemented, has cultural heritage been identified and protected?
                      •	 If the project site contains cultural heritage, have measures been taken to ensure continued access to
                         the cultural site?
