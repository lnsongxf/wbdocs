I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Macedonia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Macedonia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Macedonia
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From November to December 2016, 398 stakeholders of the WBG in Macedonia were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 206 stakeholders participated in
the survey (52% response rate).
Respondents received and responded to the questionnaires via the online survey platform
Qualtrics. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Macedonia; their overall
attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Macedonia; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (N=208). Data were weighted to reach the same stakeholder composition in
two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups which were not present in
both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to the “other”
stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of
respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in the FY’14 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in
appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison
results, please refer to Appendix E (page 88).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
       respondents from NGOs/community based organizations, private foundations, trade
       unions, and youth groups were combined in the “CSO” category; and the small number
       of respondents from independent government institutions and the office of a
       parliamentarian were included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents from
       faith-based groups and the judiciary branch.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated significantly
        lower levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY’14
        Country Survey (weighted mean in FY’17 = 6.1; weighted mean in FY’14 = 6.5)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Macedonia, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Macedonia, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

           Country Survey.
          Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
           President/Prime Minister/Minister were significantly more likely to indicate that
           Macedonia is headed in the right direction, while respondents from academia/research
           institutes/think tanks were significantly less positive about the prospect of Macedonia.

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister/
       Minister had the highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS
       indicator questions, whereas respondents from the private sector and academia had
       significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for individual indicator questions by
       stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 58).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 7.2) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 6.0). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix F (page 94).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Macedonia,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty seven
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Macedonia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at health.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Macedonia, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment.

of the following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Macedonia? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2017 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2014
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2014 COS report.

 FY 2014 Number of comparable respondents = 205  FY 2017 Number of comparable respondents = 200

By weighting, the FY 2014 and FY 2017 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
