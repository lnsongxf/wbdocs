Executive Summary

The Study Tour
Public Affairs Foundation (PAF), Bangalore hosted a delegation from the Government of Egypt’s
Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC) for a study tour from 7th to 11th March 2017
focusing on the implementation of Social Accountability (SA) Tools. The World Bank’s Technical
Assistance (WB TA) component supported this “South-South” exchange. The Tour was a follow up to
the successful workshop on Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&E) using Social
Accountability Tools, conducted by the World Bank with PAF as the lead trainer at Al Sokhna in Egypt
in May 2016.

The design of the Study Tour and its primary purpose revolved around supplementing the learning at
the May 2016 Workshop, gain firsthand knowledge through field visits, and build capacity at IDSC on
institutionalising evidence based research and monitoring of government services and programmes
using a range of PM&E and SA tools including the Citizen Report Card (CRC).

Study Tour Design
PAF designed a customised and practical programme that enabled the visiting team to:
1. Interact with the teams of PAF and its associate think tank / research organisation Public Affairs
     Centre [PAC] to learn about a) PAF/PAC's experience in the development and implementation of
     evidence based participatory SA tools and applied social research; and b) understand how these
     tools have enabled improvements in governance and delivery of public services.
2. Visit Government Departments, meet their senior officials, and get first hand feedback from
     them on how they have used citizen feedback to effect reforms and service delivery
     improvements.
3. Learn from some thought leaders and practitioners in the social development sector
     (independent think tanks and academia) on their perspectives on central, state, and local level
     planning, implementation, and monitoring of public services and social development
     programmes using a range of SA tools.
All sessions were as interactive as possible and included several hands on exercises that focused on
potential specific implementation by participants on return to Egypt.

Participants
The team of 13 participants who attended represented eight departments of IDSC and three levels.
Eight had attended the Workshop in May 2016, eight are proficient in English; six had attended the
2016 Workshop and are proficient in English.

           ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
Summary of the Sessions
On Day 1, PAF's Executive Director Mr Ravishankar Rao welcomed the participants and gave a brief
orientation to the study tour; the WB TTL Ms Amal Faltas thanked PAF and emphasised that the
outcomes expected from the Tour are specific PM&E proposals that could be presented to IDSC; Ms
Hebatallah Hamid, International Cooperation Specialist, IDSC gave a brief overview of IDSC’s mission
and scope of work.

A Keynote Address on the Structure of Governments and Governance in India delivered by
PAC's Director Mr G Gurucharan gave an overview of the federal structure of government in India,
the distribution of powers between its legislative, administrative and executive arms, and the
devolution of legislative powers. He briefly spoke about the (earlier) Planning Commission and the
(current, since 2015) National Institution for Transforming India - NITI Aayog (www.niti.gov.in),
Government of India's premier policy Think Tank, headed by the Prime Minister, and consisting of
various Union Cabinet Ministers and Chief Ministers of all States.

India, he said, has made much progress but much more needs to be done, for example, to eradicate
poverty, reduce vulnerability, and improve education and health. He spoke about PAC/PAF's
Founder (late) Dr Samuel Paul and his immense contributions to the process of measuring and
improving governance across the world.

Dr C K Mathew, Senior Fellow & Head, Public Policy and Research Group, PAC, gave an introduction
to the origins and concept of Public Affairs Index 2016 [PAI] - its need to measure governance,
methodology, results, and dissemination, and about the forthcoming PAI 2017. He said that it is
perhaps the first time that a non-government institution such as PAC has produced a comprehensive
index to measure and compare the performance of all 30 States of India on a wide range of 10 major
themes, 25 focus subjects, and 68 indicators. PAI's uniqueness, and its strength, credibility, and
reliability, stem from the use of only government published data accessible to citizens.

He gave some interesting comparative insights about Egypt and India in terms of Population; GDP;
Poverty Head Count; Life expectancy at birth; Geographical area; Urban vs rural, and Administrative
structure.

Day 2 consisted of field visits planned around providing opportunities for participants to meet and
observe various Government institutions and officials that had used Social Accountability Tools to
assess their work.

First, the team visited a government run residential school (50 km east of Bangalore) with 250
underprivileged boys and girls in classes 6 to 10. The purpose of the visit was to understand the
academic, administrative, and infrastructure facilities available in the school through observation
and interactions with different stake holders, use this "scoping" information to prepare (on Day 3) an
M&E plan to assess the school's facilities, and get hands-on experience of collecting data. The team
recorded their observations in hand held Android Tablets using PAF's specifically designed and pre-
loaded observation checklist, and had interesting interactions with some boys and girls.

In the afternoon, the team visited the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company [BESCOM] Call Centre.
Here they witnessed grievance redress in action at the 24/7, 30-seat call centre called Public
Grievance Redressal System (PGRS) where citizens’ complaints are received by trained customer care
executives, promptly responded to, and resolved.

           ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
The team then met Mr P Manivannan, Secretary, Social Welfare Department (SWD), Government of
Karnataka (GoK), to get a government official’s perspective on using SA Tools, and data driven
decision making. Mr Manivannan said bureaucrats are both policy makers and implementers, and
work under immense pressure. In order to change/improve any policy or process, there needs to be
evidence that the existing one is not working as well as it should. This is where agencies like PAF help
the government to understand ground realities. He said the study conducted by PAC led to many
changes in the functioning of BESCOM. He hoped the government machinery would be more open
to listening to citizens' voices through CRCs and other accountability mechanisms that could help
them to serve citizens better.

In the first half of Day 3, Mr T R Raghunandan, Advisor, Accountability Initiative (Non-Profit Think
Tank/Civil Society Organization), explained the concept of citizenship - a legal and political status -
conferred by the state by which citizens secure their identity, exercise their rights, and participate in
society. He gave an insight into fiscal decentralization in India and how citizens could be empowered
to hold their governments responsible for compliance with financial norms by using social
accountability tools such as participatory budgeting, public expenditure tracking surveys, social
audits, and use of transparency portals. He explained the process and modes of assigning
expenditure responsibilities to different levels of government, the constitutional framework for
inter-governmental fiscal transfers in India, grants in aid provided to states and their further sharing
between the State and Local Governments.

In the second half, the team went through hands-on exercises using case study and field visit
materials from Day 2 to discuss, plan and prepare M&E studies of SWD run schools and hostels. This
covered the scope of the study, its objectives, tools to be used, sampling plan, stakeholders to be
interviewed, timelines, and plans for reporting and dissemination. Both groups briefly presented
their plans. The PAF team provided its inputs and suggestions.

Ms Amal Faltas conducted a debrief session of the three days’ sessions, and hoped that participants
would make full use of the learning from the Study Tour to make specific proposals for monitoring
and evaluation of development programmes that require attention in Egypt, and that they would
present these to IDSC on their return.

On Day 4, participants visited the PAC/PAF Campus and spent the day interacting with the staff and
guest speakers through seminars on various topics of interest that showcased the portfolio of PAC's
current work in different areas such as:
 Citizens Involvement in Monitoring of PMGSY Roads (Prime Minister's Rural Roads Scheme) -
    Mr Basil Liongs, Head - Citizen Action and Support Group, PAC, presented this project for GoI's
    National Rural Roads Development Authority that enabled citizens to monitor (using simple tools
    and training), the quality of construction and maintenance of rural roads.
 Climate Change Score Card: Mr Arvind Sha highlighted PAC's focus on constructive engagement
    “to move environment research away from a top -down, extractive and information gathering
    process to a participatory, bottom-up and inclusive process to ensure sustainable development”.
    He mentioned the SA tools developed and used by PAC in monitoring and evaluation of
    environment related issues - Green Manifesto, PAC Waste Tracker (for Solid Waste
    Management), and Climate Change Scorecard (CCSC); he conducted a hands-on exercise for
    using the CCSC in Egypt.

           ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
   Dr Shreelata Seshadri, Azim Premji University, Bangalore spoke on “From MDGs to SDGs -
    Implications for India’s Health, Nutrition and Education Sectors”. Using data on poverty,
    malnutrition and stunting among children in India, from the National Family Health Surveys
    (NFHS), she highlighted the importance of good, reliable data in measuring progress of a nation,
    whether in the MDGs phase, or the current SDGs.
   Improving Consumer Voices and Accountability in Swachh Bharat Mission [SBM(G)]: Dr Meena
    Nair, Head - Participatory Governance Research Group, PAC, gave a brief overview of this GoI
    programme; the study conducted by PAC and PAF across two large Indian states (Odisha + Tamil
    Nadu) over a three year period (2014 -17) on behalf of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; the
    SA tools used (CRC, CRC+, CSC); the study objectives; and the steps taken to achieve them. She
    highlighted (with examples) some of the key themes and learning from the study, which she said
    could never have been collected, analysed or interpreted from routinely compiled statistics, data
    or opinions. Dr Meena spoke about the need for advocacy and briefly covered some of the
    advocacy initiatives undertaken.

On Day 5, based on the visit to a school on Day 2, the two IDSC groups continued discussions and
presentation of their proposals for an M&E study of schools/hostels. PAF team provided inputs on
how they could make their studies more comprehensive and robust. PAF then briefly presented the
actual questionnaires used in their ongoing study; these helped the IDSC team to understand the
nuances of questionnaire design and sampling.

Using PAF's template, participants presented a basic structure of the Study Tour Note that they
would place before the IDSC management for consideration. These covered the potential sectors
and programmes for which monitoring and evaluation could be piloted, and the SA tools that could
be used. PAF team provided inputs to the teams on how they could refine their Notes, after the
teams return to Egypt, to make their proposals more comprehensive and robust.

Way Forward: Mr Ravishankar Rao summarised the learning from the Study Tour for both IDSC and
PAF and presented his views on the way forward. He encouraged participants to share what they
had learnt with IDSC's management, and through them, with their colleagues.

All members from the IDSC team were awarded "Certificates of Participation".

The IDSC team appreciated and thanked PAF and WB for organising and supporting this very useful,
productive, and enjoyable Study Tour.

Participants evaluated each session on all five days, and the overall Study Tour. All thirteen gave a
rating of 4 or 5 (out of a maximum of 5) to the Study Tour on design, content and facilitation by the
trainers / PAF.

                                                STUDY TOUR REPORT


1. Background1

The Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC) is Egypt’s premier policy and strategy think
tank that reports directly to the Egyptian Cabinet of Ministers and is critical in conducting evidence-
based research, providing policy advice, and influencing the focus and implementation of
Government of Egypt (GoE) programs.

At the request of the GoE, the World Bank (WB), through a grant2 from the MENA Multi-Donor
Trust Fund (MDTF), is providing Technical Assistance (TA) to IDSC to promote a new social contract
for the Egyptian people that empowers and engages citizens and civil society actors to become equal
partners in the policy-making process and furthers Egypt’s democratic transition. The two specific
elements of the IDSC’s work that will be supported are:

(i)        The Equitable Development Observatory (EDO): This focuses on poverty monitoring and
           targeting in relationship to the GoE's priority social protection programs for the poor.
(ii)       Participatory Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E): This component will seek to establish
           structured mechanisms to engage citizens in the process of assessing different government
           policies, programs and activities. This will build on existing IDSC work including the systems
           of observatories (eg: the community observatory), opinion polls and field surveys and
           leverage IDSC’s mandate to promote active citizenship and institutionalized channels for
           participation and social dialogue.

The combination of beneficiary feedback and evidence-based decision making for achieving stronger
results will strengthen the GoE’s efforts to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity. Citizens’
engagement in the assessment of policies and programs of the government will work to strengthen
the sense of social accountability and will help in creating channels of trust between the government
and citizen. For decision makers, this component will serve in following up the progress achieved in
such programs and policies, encourage learning, help in studying reactions and extract results and
lessons learned to inform the decision making process for improving the programs further. The
combination of beneficiary feedback and evidence-based decision making for achieving stronger
results will strengthen the GoE’s efforts to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity.

The TA is a WB executed activity covering two main components as follows:

          Component 1: Diagnostic Analysis and Capacity Building: In supporting the two elements of
           the IDSC (as above), WB will undertake a series of diagnostic exercises to assess the
           functioning of the EDO and current M&E systems and identify its strengths and weaknesses.
           Based on this, WB will undertake a series of training and capacity building activities around

               ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
        these themes based on international best practice with monitoring of social protection
        programs and participatory M&E methodologies, which can be adapted by the IDSC for the
        Egyptian context. Specifically, WB will introduce IDSC to internationally recognized
        participatory M&E tools such as the Citizen Report Card (CRC) that can be applied for
        assessing the quality of service delivery in social sectors. Outputs from the component will
        include research studies, guidance materials and policy notes, as well as a series of training
        workshops and seminars (both face-to-face and via VC). These efforts would in turn assist in
        developing a revamped participatory M&E system for the IDSC.
       Component 2: South-South exchange and knowledge support: The second component will
        finance a range of knowledge and technical support activities. This will include connecting
        the IDSC to other international think-tanks engaging in social accountability related work
        (such as the Public Affairs Foundation in Bangalore, India) through a range of virtual as well
        as physical south-south exchanges. As part of the knowledge sharing under this program, a
        series of experience sharing workshops covering various tools of participatory M&E and
        Social Accountability such as CRCs (among others) and study tours to gain firsthand
        knowledge will be undertaken.

2. Role of Public Affairs Foundation [PAF]
PAF is a knowledge‐based service organisation committed to improving the quality of governanc e by
providing advisory support and customised knowledge products to a wide range of clients in the
public arena. PAF’s strengths lie in its rich experience and ability to conceptualise, plan, and design
fact-finding projects; collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate authentic and comprehensive user
feedback; and monitor processes and evaluate interventions.

Since it was established in 2003, PAF has completed numerous social research projects in India and
overseas using social accountability tools such as Citizen Report Cards (CRCs) and Community Score
Cards (CSCs). With sound and well tested methods, and emphasis on quality, PAF has been able to
deliver reliable assessments, inputs and insights into service delivery reform based on citizen
feedback while establishing the Foundation's credibility in the development sector. PAF has been
constructively collaborating and partnering with Municipal Corporations, State and Central
Governments in India, International Donors (for projects in India and many other countries),
and Civil Society Organisations to "close the citizen feedback loop" by hearing the voices of citizens
and then helping these organisations to listen and act upon the feedback they receive.

PAF has been involved intensively and directly in the CRC process with varied contexts in several
countries, covering almost all major public services. Based on this rich experience, PAF has been
implementing CRCs (see PAF's Snapshot in Annexure 1), conducting training workshops on CRCs in
India and many other countries (for WB/IDSC in Egypt in 2016; ANSA-AW in Jordan in 2015 for
participants from 7 Arab Countries - Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia, Yemen;
MASAF in Malawi in 2015-16; for R4D in Uganda in 2013; and TASAF in Tanzania in 2012). PAF has
also been facilitating study tours for team of Government officials (TASAF & MASAF to Bangalore in
2012) to build capacities on the use of CRC methodologies within client organisations - governments
and civil society - to help develop internal capabilities for better governance and delivery of services.
These workshops and study tours are custom designed for clients and aim at giving participants a
conceptual as well as hands on knowledge on the Citizen Report Card approach. Participants at the
workshops and study tours have been from government and civil society, from one or several
countries, and from one or several services.

            ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
3. The Study Tour
The Technical Team Lead (TTL) at World Bank's Cairo Office is in charge of executing the TA
(mentioned in the "Background" above). The TTL and her team closely coordinated with IDSC and
PAF to support the Study Tour to Bangalore, and enabled PAF to execute it. A team of 13 IDSC Staff
attended.

3.1 PAF’s Objectives
This Study Tour was a part of the South-South exchange of information and knowledge sharing in the
practice of participatory M&E and Social Accountability tools. PAF designed a customised and
practical programme that enabled the visiting team to:

4. Interact with the teams of Public Affairs Foundation [PAF] and its associate think tank / research
   organisation Public Affairs Centre [PAC]. PAC and PAF shared with participants their experience
   (of 36+ years combined) in the development and implementation of evidence based
   participatory Social Accountability (SA) tools and applied social research. They demonstrated
   how these tools have facilitated better understanding and enabled improvements in governance
   and delivery of public services to citizens across a wide spectrum of sectors and geographies in
   India and other developing countries.
5. Visit Government Departments [Social Welfare (SWD), Bangalore Electricity Supply Company
   (BESCOM)], meet their senior Officials, and get first hand feedback on how they have used
   citizen feedback to effect reforms and service delivery improvements.
6. Learn from some thought leaders and practitioners in the social development sector such as
   independent think tanks [Accountability Initiative (AI)] and academia [Azim Premji University
   (APU)] on their perspectives on central, state, and local level planning, implementation, and
   monitoring of public services and social development programmes using a range of SA tools such
   as CRCs, CSCs, PET, IA, GRM, and others.

All sessions were as interactive as possible and included several hands on exercises that focused on
potential specific implementation by participants on return to Egypt.

The primary purpose of the Study Tour was to supplement the learning at the May 2016 Workshop
& Clinic, gain firsthand knowledge, and build capacity at IDSC on institutionalising evidence based
research and monitoring of government services and programmes using a range of participatory
M&E and Social Accountability tools including the Citizen Report Card.

The overarching objectives of the Study Tour were to create a deeper interest among the
participants to learn more about each of the SA tools; enable them understand how these tools can
complement ones that they are already familiar with; have an understanding of how to use the more
comprehensive set of tools to enable them provide IDSC's stakeholders - the Cabinet and various
Ministries - with more robust, evidence (users' voice) based research that will help inform policy,
enable improvements in service delivery, and strengthen governance, in their own contexts; and
build capacities to train others in IDSC (and in the client Ministries, if required) to institutionalise
evidence based research using the entire range of tools.

           ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
3.2 Pre-Study Tour Preparations and Post-Study Tour Deliverables by Participants
Based on PAF's learning at the Workshop & Clinic in Egypt in May 2016, and their interactions with a
very knowledgeable and enthusiastic group of participants from IDSC and MOIIC, the Study Tour
Agenda covered specific sectors that would be of interest to the visiting team.

To make the Study Tour as focused and effective as possible, PAF had requested IDSC and all
participants to make preparations in three stages:
     prior to their arrival in Bangalore - recap learning at the May 2016 Workshop in Egypt and
        commence planning the SDGs, sector/s, and program/s in which to implement PM&E studies
     while in Bangalore - each participant should (a) interactively discuss, in each session, issues
        that can aid implementation of PM&E study/s on their return, for the specific sectors /
        programs chosen by them; and (b) create and discuss a suitable structure / implementation
        plan prior to departure from India
     on return to Egypt - refine the structure / plans prepared as above and present their specific
        proposal/s to the concerned stakeholders

The "Pre-Study Tour preparations ('homework') for Participants" and "Study Tour Note" are given in
Annexure 2.

           ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
3.3 Scope of work
PAF conducted and facilitated the Study Tour covering the following scope of work:
1. Planned the agenda and schedule in consultation with WB TA team, and organised, managed, and
    facilitated all activities.
2. Put together an internal (PAF / PAC) and external panel of speakers who shared their experience in
    using SA tools to assess implementation and monitoring of government programmes; most sessions
    had hands on exercises and interactive discussions that were linked to possible practical applications
    in the Egyptian context; hence most speakers and presenters were also "trainers".
3. Organized field visits to government offices / agencies, interacted with officials, and discussed the
    outcomes of using participatory monitor mechanisms and citizens feedback.
4. Materials used in all sessions were compiled and provided in pen drives to participants.
5. Hosted the visiting team and took care of them from arrival (on 7th March till departure on 12th
    March 2017 [ie: airport transfers, hotel accommodation, breakfast and lunch, conference
    proceedings, local transport for field visits].
6. Overall: PAF provided guidance and support to the IDSC team to develop
     notes that reflect their learning in Egypt (2016) and India (2017)
     specific action plans for implementing their learning to benefit IDSC in improving public service
         delivery and strengthening governance in their own contexts

The day-wise Agenda is Annexure 3; brief profiles of the external (invited) speakers and PAF / PAC
resource persons are in Annexure 4. PAF designed the content so as to make it as focused as possible to
meet the objectives of the study tour.

3.4 Suggested Profile of Participants
For optimum effectiveness and utility to participants, IDSC, and WB, PAF had suggested (Annexure 5)
that the group size should be about 10 to 15 persons; that the team should consist of a good mix of
personnel from different levels and relevant inter-related functions of IDSC; that they should be involved
in monitoring and evaluation of Government of Egypt's social development programmes and delivery of
public services; and have proficiency in English.

The team of 13 participants who attended represented eight departments: Policies Monitoring &
Evaluation, Information Analysis, Information Resources, International Cooperation, Quality, Public
Opinion Poll Center, E-Complaints System, and Population & Sustainable Development; and three levels:
Managers, Researchers, and Specialists. In this team
     8 (62%) had attended the Workshop in Al Sokhna in May 2016
     8 (62%) are proficient in English
     6 (46%) had attended the 2016 Workshop and are proficient in English

Day 1- Session 2: IDSC - GoE's Think Tank
Ms Hebatallah Abdelhamid
International Co-operation Specialist, IDSC

Ms Heba made a well-structured presentation to give PAF (and PAC) an overview of the GoE's think
tank.

She outlined IDSC's mission to incubate leading consultants, experts, advisors and researchers in
government and academia in Egypt leading to independent, high quality research, policy
recommendations and analysis on a full range of public policy issues. The main aim is to bridge the
advocacy gap that results from integrating expert knowledge into the evidenced based decision making
process.

Disasters, Central Operational Room, and Presiding National Committees of IDSC.




Ms Heba highlighted how the E-Complain System facilitates communication between the citizens and
decision-makers about the citizens’ concerns. She said that IDSC is engaged in monitoring and evaluating
a wide range of policies, programs and activities. The M & E process covers three steps - monitoring and
evaluation of various policies, programs, and projects to assess the impact of specific governmental
policies; periodic follow-up of the government statements to identify, prioritize and raise public debates
on critical issues; and tracing Egypt’s development in the international reports’ context.

Regional Integration, to share experiences in decision support with neighbouring countries, and Regional
and International Partners for social development, were also mentioned.




For PAF and PAC, this presentation about IDSC's wide range and large scale of work was a very useful
learning.

Day 1- Session 3: Keynote Address - Structure of Governments and Governance in India
Mr G Gurucharan, IAS (Retired)
Director, Public Affairs Centre

Governments and Governance
Mr Gurucharan welcomed everyone to India and to PAF/PAC, and hoped that their learning from the
Study Tour would benefit them, IDSC, WB, and the citizens of Egypt.

He gave an overview of the positive social changes being witnessed in India and Egypt. He said that such
Study Tours enable exchange of useful ideas and relevant information and hoped that PAF/PAC in India
and IDSC in Egypt, along with the World Bank, can learn from each other and build a long term
partnership. The aim, he said, should be to treat social accountability as the big picture, and not merely
at a programme or department level. He emphasized the need to share relevant tools from both
countries and use them for better governance. He said India and Egypt are somewhat similar in terms of
the democratic political structure, development, poverty ratio, human development index, the young
populations with hope and aspirations of jobs and a better life.

Mr Gurucharan gave an overview of the federal structure of government in India as mandated by the
Constitution, the distribution of powers between its three main arms - legislative, administrative and
executive, and the devolution of legislative powers to the states through Union, State, and Concurrent
lists.

Planning
He briefly outlined the role of the (earlier, since 1950) Planning Commission and the (current, since
2015) NITI Aayog, the National Institution for Transforming India. NITI Aayog (www.niti.gov.in), he
explained, is a premier policy Think Tank of the Government of India which focuses on national
development priorities, sectors and strategies with the active involvement of States. It is headed by the
Prime Minister, and consists of various Cabinet Ministers and Chief Ministers of all States.

Development in India and Egypt
India, he said, has made much progress but it is still work-in-progress. Much more needs to be done to
eradicate poverty, reduce vulnerability, and improve education and health.

Mr Gurucharan spoke about PAC/PAF's Founder (late) Dr Samuel Paul and his immense contributions to
the process of measuring and improving governance across the world. He introduced PAC's group
leaders and outlined their work. He highlighted the importance of partnering with government for
effecting improvements in governance and achieving scale to bring about the desired impact.

Challenges and Possible Solutions
Mr Gurucharan said that large parts of the economy are run by the state, sometimes less effectively
than desired or possible, while many aspects are managed more efficiently by the market. These and
other imbalances create many barriers to India's growth. He said the need is to strike a meaningful
balance between the activities of the market and the state.

He made a historical reference to the Indian Civil Service (ICS), the administrative bureaucracy that was
created to solely serve and further the political and economic interests of (the then) British rulers. After
India's independence in 1947, even though the ICS transformed into the Indian Administrative Service

(IAS), the difference was unfortunately only in form, not in content. There was no role for participatory
governance in a very large country with an extremely diverse, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual population,
that urgently required unification and a common market.

Mr Gurucharan suggested that we should view development from the perspective of Human
Development. India's path to prosperity remains fragile. Many pockets of India still do not have access
to education, health and sustainable income, and along with inequality and poverty, are hindering
growth. Due to the extreme diversity of our people, there is a need to have local, regional and
population-specific solutions to the many problems being faced, along with improving skills and capacity
building at all levels in order to improve governance.

He spoke of some of the direct protection / safety nets offered by the Government for the poor and
vulnerable such as pensions, subsidies, direct transfer of funds, and subsidized food, to improve social
security.

He briefly described PAC's collaborative project with Governments and NGOs in seven Indian states to
train local communities and involve them in monitoring the construction / maintenance of rural roads)
to help citizens participate in the creation of assets that serve them better.

Mr Gurucharan concluded by saying that evidence based policy decisions and are the best way forward
for all stakeholders. Combined with this, it is essential to develop metrics that regularly measure
performance, review outcomes, and evaluate impact of policies and programmes.

He wished everyone a pleasant and enjoyable stay in Bangalore, and welcomed them to visit us again.

Day 1- Session 4: Measuring Governance: Public Affairs Index (PAI)

Dr. C.K. Mathew IAS (Retd)
Senior Fellow & Head, Public Policy and Research Group, PAC

Dr Mathew gave an introduction to the origins and concept of Public Affairs Index 2016 - its need to
measure governance, methodology, results, and dissemination, and about the forthcoming PAI 2017. He
said that it is perhaps the first time that a non-government institution such as PAC has produced a
comprehensive index to measure and compare the performance of all 30 States of India on a wide range
of themes, subjects, and indicators. PAI's uniqueness, and its strength, credibility, and reliability, stem
from the use of only government published data accessible to citizens.

He gave some comparative insights about Egypt and India in terms of Population; GDP; Poverty Head
Count; Life expectancy at birth; Geographical area; Urban vs rural, and Administrative structure. He also
explained how India is geographically, regionally, ethnically diversified.




He quoted noted economist J M Keynes, and highlighted how his thoughts are echoed by the World
Bank's views on good governance.




Dr Mathew spoke of the twelve principals of good governance. As examples, he mentioned
Transparency - free flow of information and its access to citizens; and Accountability - a two way process
by which citizens should be aware of their right to information; and decision-makers in government, the
private sector and civil society organizations should be accountable to citizens.

       He highlighted the complexity of governance in India and quoted the Prime Minister’s call and
       commitment in 2014 to "maximise governance and minimise government". He provided an overview of
       distribution of power, as per the Constitution, between the Union and the States through three lists -
       List I: Union list, List II: State list, and List III: Concurrent list.

He explained why, apart from the breadth and depth of analysis through the three tier matrix, PAI is
unique and different from others indices. To complement the quantitative aspects of the analysis and
findings, he said rich, qualitative data through a "sentiment analysis" was also gathered (through news
articles and tweets of various stakeholders) to provide feedback on the emotional aspects of
development.




Dr Mathew presented some key findings of the project. Kerala, among the large states, scored the
highest and ranked first; amongst the small states Mizoram ranked the highest. He spoke about the
dissemination process whereby the findings were shared with the Union Government and all State
Governments.

Day 1- Session 5: Hands-on Simulation Exercises

a) "Egyptian Development Index (EDI)"

Mr Vivek Divekar, Project Consultant, and Ms Udita Dutta, Programme Officer, PAC held an interactive
session to guide participants to simulate creation of an "Egyptian Development Index (EDI)" for IDSC .
They outlined a few potential themes relevant to the Egyptian context; each theme had some focus
subjects; and each focus subject had selected indicators. Participants (in two teams) were asked to
retain theme/s they felt are more important, and cross out theme/s they thought are less important;
then they had to assign weights to each focus subject (out of a maximum of 100). Example: For the
theme Essential Infrastructure, Team 1 gave a weight of25% for each of the four focus subjects, while
Team 2 thought Housing was not important and weighed power (50%), water (30%) and road (20%).

b) Preparation for Day 2 - Field Visits:

(i) Recap of 2016 Al Sokhna Workshop

Dr Lalita Pulavarti, Senior Manager - Projects, PAF recalled and summarised the various tools and
processes discussed during the May 2016 Al Sokhna Workshop:
     CRCs, CSCs, IAs, RCTs, SIAs
     Selection of tools, questionnaire design, sampling

She asked the group to recall the difference between an "opinion poll" and a "CRC". One of the
participants correctly said that opinion poll is about the views or perception about a service even if one
has had no experience of the programme or service, while the CRC approach includes feedback only if
one has experienced these. She explained that the idea of CRC was the outcome of structured, evidence
based information received by service providers (typically government) from independent sources
outside the government. Gradually, as government saw the merit of this data driven approach and its
several uses, the government itself began asking for independent CRCs to be conducted in various
sectors by neutral external agencies.

(ii) Hand Held Tablets for Data Collection

Each participant was then given a hand held tablet which they would need to use during the field visit on
Day 2 to gather data from a government school. Mr Narendra, Manager - Projects, PAF walked the
participants through different steps of using the tablet for computer aided personal interviews (CAPI).
He helped the participants practice a few questions in the questionnaire that had already been loaded
on the tablet.

                                        Day 2: Wednesday, March 8, 2017

The day consisted of field visits covering three organisations / locations.


Day 2 - Session 1: Moraji Desai Residential School (MDRS)

This boarding school is in Ramanagara District, 50 km east of Bangalore; has 250 underprivileged
children (boys and girls) in classes 6 to 10; is run by KREIS/SWD/GoK.

Before proceeding to the school, the team was provided with a brief note to acquaint them with the
structure and functioning of KRIES Residential Schools. The purpose of the visit was to:
    1. understand the academic, administrative, and infrastructure facilities available in the school
        through observation and interactions with different stake holders
    2. use this "scoping" information for smaller groups from the team to prepare (on Day 3) an M&E
        plan for assessing SWD run residential schools
    3. get hands on experience of collecting data via ODK using hand held Android Tablets

On arrival the IDSC team was warmly welcomed by the staff and students, provided a brief introduction
to the establishment of the school, student and staff strength, various facilities available to students in
the school and the hostel.

The team was taken on a short tour of all the facilities of the school - classrooms, science labs, library,
physical education and sports, hostels, dining halls, kitchen, bathrooms and toilets, playgrounds,
security / surveillance, and shown the monthly hygiene kits given to boys and girls. The highlight of the
school tour was a ‘smart class’ in which students who were learning with audio visual aids said that they
particularly liked this class because it made learning more fun!

During the tour the team recorded their observations in the Android tablets using PAF's specifically
designed and pre-loaded observation checklist. The team keenly interacted with boys and girls (Class 9)
and asked them what they liked about their school/hostel; whether they are happy staying there; do
they use all the facilities provided; how often do they meet their parents; what problems they face; and
what changes would they like to see in their school.

                                         IDSC team interacting with students




Most students said they are happy being in the school; that they do not miss their families; that they get
to meet them at home during summer vacations (April, May) and festive holidays (October), and when
parents visit them at school (once a month); they are satisfied with the facilities provided, and use all of
them. Students were not satisfied with the quality of drinking water available in the hostels; they
suggested that purification units be placed here so that they need not fetch purified water from the
dining halls.

Day 2 - Session 2: Bangalore Electricity Supply Company [BESCOM] Call Center - Example of a
Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) in operation
Mr Bhanuprakash, Assistant General Manager - Customer Relations, BESCOM

Mr Bhanuprakash made a brief presentation about BESCOM (see http://bescom.org/en, and
http://bescom.org/en/citizens-charter/) and the Company's operations for distribution of power in
Bangalore city and eight surrounding districts of Karnataka State across all sectors (domestic, industrial,
and public), serving a 20.7 million people.

The team witnessed the grievance redress in action at the 24/7, 30-seat call centre called Public
Grievance Redressal System (PGRS) where citizens complaints are received by trained customer care
executives, and responded / resolved. Citizens have a wide choice of how they can easily communicate -
toll free number, sms, BESCOM's web portal, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, and more.

The Call Centre receives about 15,000 calls every day, responds to and resolves about 8,000 calls, and
disposes about 2000 calls for issues not related to them. To enhance capacity to respond to about 5000
calls that they are currently unable to handle, they intend to increase the seats from 30 to 45.

On registering a complaint, a docket number is instantly generated and sent by sms to the consumer
and simultaneously to the concerned area executive engineer who then forwards it to the specific
person in field maintenance for action. Subsequently, the customer care executive calls the complainant
to check if their problem is satisfactorily resolved.

Day 2 - Session 3: A Government Official’s perspective on using Social Accountability Tools,
and data driven decision making
Mr P Manivannan (IAS)
Secretary, Social Welfare Department (SWD)
& Chief Project Officer, Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP)
[Former Managing Director, BESCOM], Government of Karnataka

Background:
In 2012-13, Public Affairs Centre had conducted a CRC and provided citizen's feedback to BESCOM; this highlighted
not only the many problems faced by citizens but also the poor image of the organisation. With the intention of
improving their services and their image, BESCOM initiated several reforms. They began "listening" to citizens
through the grievance redress system; the call centre is one of the outcomes. [Also see their Citizen's Charter:
http://bescom.org/en/citizens-charter/]


Mr Manivannan met the team in the Board Room of BESCOM, and warmly welcomed them.

He said bureaucrats are both policy makers and implementers, and work under immense pressure. In
order to change any policy or process, there needs to be evidence that the existing one is not working as
well as it should. This is where agencies like PAF help the government to understand what is actually
happening on the ground in a more nuanced manner. Stakeholders have the choice of viewing evidence
on the functioning of the government either positively and negatively.

Taking a positive view (as he did) could lead to public policies / processes being suitably modified to
improve the delivery of services. As an example he said that the BESCOM study conducted by PAC led to
many changes in the functioning of BESCOM.

On the other hand government machinery may view CRC findings negatively and choose to ignore them.
He however hoped the government machinery would be more open to citizen voices through CRCs and
other accountability mechanisms that could help them to serve citizens better.

             Mr Manivannan shares his thoughts on the practical uses of Social Accountability Tools

Day 3 - Session 1: M&E from a Government Perspective- Central Government, State
Government and Local Government (Decentralisation, Public Expenditure and Budget
Tracking)
Mr T R Raghunandan (IAS, Retired)
Advisor
Accountability Initiative (Non-Profit Think Tank/Civil Society Organization)

Mr Raghunandan explained the concept of citizenship, which is a legal and political status, conferred by
the state by which citizens have certain rights to secure their identity, exercise their rights, and
participate in society. Citizenship, he said, can have three approaches that are:
State cantered / Citizen cantered / Market cantered

He explained all the approaches, and their positive and negative aspects. He elaborated on the Citizen
cantered approach which lays emphasis on enabling citizens to participate in the decision making
process. He talked about some of the criticisms levelled against the citizen centred approach; the
circumstances under which participation is most effective; and how citizen participation contributes to
democracy. He said effective participation enables citizens to seek better functioning of the government
through transparency and increased accountability.

Day 3 - Session 2: Deconstructing Accountability
Mr Raghunandan said that in a democracy, accountability (ie: being answerable for efficiently
performing ones duties and effectively delivering expected outcomes / results) is possible only when
there is commensurate authority. Accountability is a process within the principal - agent relationship
where the citizen is the principal on whose behalf the state acts as the agent. The agent (state) can be
held accountable by the principal (citizen) for non-performance and seek improvements.

There are two routes by which citizens can hold their governments accountable for providing services
and for their actions. Conducting CRCs is the short, direct route; however, this route does not
necessarily ensure that the government takes corrective actions or becomes more responsible. In the
long, indirect route such as elections, there is a considerable time lag and citizens have to wait (five
years in India) to hold the government accountable for its actions. He said different forms of
accountability - demand and supply side, and horizontal and vertical - should be considered.

He presented (see matrix below) the range of government functions, the social accountability processes,
and the mechanisms and tools available for monitoring and evaluation.

Day 3 - Session 3: Fiscal Decentralization in India

Mr Raghunandan gave an insight into fiscal decentralization in India and how citizens could be
empowered to hold their governments responsible for compliance with financial norms by using social
accountability tools such as participatory budgeting, public expenditure tracking surveys, social audits,
and use of transparency portals. He explained the process of assigning expenditure responsibilities to
different levels of government by modes of delegation, de-concentration, and devolution (see matrix
below).

He spoke of the various ways in which fiscal transfers occurred, the constitutional framework for inter-
governmental fiscal transfers in India, grants in aid provided to states, and how this is further shared
between the State and Local Governments.

Day 3 - Session 4: PAISA (Planning, Allocations and Expenditures, Institutions in
Accountability) for Panchayat
Mr Raghunandan explained the initiative of Centre for Public Research (CPR, cprindia.org) called "PAISA
for Panchayat" which tries to track the flow of funds from the Centre to the State, and onward to the
local bodies. The objective is to understand whether decentralisation translates to actual availability of
funds, and thereby services, on the ground. A study in Karnataka found that the maximum flow of funds
was used for government staff salaries.

Local governments had little knowledge of budget allocations for development; hence there is no real
true devolution. One way to resolve these issues, he said, is to disseminate information to local
governments.

To attempt to bring about changes and improvements in the Egyptian context, a beginning can be made
in sectors / areas that are in need of urgent reform, touch the lives of those in most need, are non-
controversial, and which require little investment. Suitably communicating plans and actions - internally,
within the government, and externally - with citizens, is important.

Day 4 - Session 1: Welcome, Overview of PAC, and Setting the Context
Mr G Gurucharan, IAS (Retired)
Director, PAC

Welcome
Mr Gurucharan welcomed participants and said that he was honoured by the visit to PAC and PAF by
such an important delegation from IDSC and the Government of Egypt. He said that the entire team at
PAC and PAF are keen to engage and interact with the IDSC team.

He said that the pace of change in national and international development, and the associated problems
and challenges, are so rapid that we need to quickly, and continuously, upgrade our capabilities and
skills in order to make meaningful contributions to governance and Government.

Overview of PAC
He briefly outlined PAC's beginnings, the journey so far, and their current work. He said that PAC is a
result of the Founder (late) Dr Samuel Paul's clear vision, from a simple idea in 1994 to an established
and well recognised institution. Instead of merely complaining about the poor civic services in
Bangalore, Dr Paul decided to find workable solutions. He focused on service delivery and what can be
done better to improve services to citizens. To do so, he pioneered an important Social Accountability
tool - the Citizen Report Card (CRC) - which has been widely accepted and used by many organizations
around the world (including the World Bank).

A CRC on electricity supply in Bangalore city was conducted by PAC independent of the Government.
Dr Paul presented the study to the service provider. The results caused much surprise and shock. The
city's citizens had a poor impression about electricity supply; many had to pay bribes to get an electricity
connection; complaints made were either not heard or there was no response. The service provider's
initial reaction was to dismiss the report as faulty. However, Dr Paul persisted and demonstrated to
them that the strength of the report was in its study design and methodology by which robust feedback
had been gathered from a scientifically picked and representative sample of citizens. The agency was
(finally) convinced, and used the findings to initiate reforms.

PAC is a non-partisan, independent, non-profit think tank and is not aligned with any political party or
government or business interests. PAC's research is based on evidence and primary data collected from
actual users of services, especially the under-served and marginalized sections of the population whose
voices are not usually heard. PAC studies and presents its findings in a non-judgmental and neutral
manner, covering all aspects of policies and programmes - the good, the average, and the not so good -
as experienced by users. These learning helps course corrections and improvements.

Mr Gurucharan highlighted that the three key players - the state, the market and civil society - all need
to play their respective roles to achieve good governance.

Setting the Context (for IDSC)
He suggested that, from amongst the many agencies they serve, IDSC can prioritise sectors that need
urgent attention (say, health); choose the targeted population (marginalised); pick the geographies
(most backward); clearly define the problem (high infant mortality rate); have targeted and time bound
strategic objectives (reduction of IMR); specify how and what to measure in the policy / programme

     28    TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
(reduce infant mortality in the 0 - 3 age group by x% vs the national average of y%); define the
qualitative and quantitative indicators and matrices; and stay focused on the key parameters.

It is extremely important, he said, to make a distinction between – outputs, outcomes, and impact.
Quite often, outputs are measured as indicators of performance, rather than outcomes and impact. As
an example, he mentioned that the outcomes of constructing rural roads are access to schools, primary
health care centres, cities, while the impact is increased and sustainable livelihoods and income for
people who can easily and quickly transport and sell their agricultural produce.

To a query from a participant on an example of impact based research by PAC, Mr Gurucharan quoted
PAC's collaborative efforts with the Government, local NGOs and citizens of villages / communities to
monitor the quality of roads being constructed (and maintained, if already built) under the Prime
Minister's National Programme for Rural Roads. The problems faced were poor quality and corruption.
Through an innovative approach, citizens were trained (and empowered) to check the quality of the
roads being constructed or maintained, caution the contractor, and seek his compliance with required
parameters. Successful implementation of this approach in seven states of the country was appreciated
by Government's National Roads Authority; PAC is being asked to replicate the community led
monitoring of roads in more states across India.

In conclusion, Mr Gurucharan wished the visiting team well. He expressed that PAC and PAF look
forward to collaborating with IDSC in the future, in any manner that is appropriate, and to having more
dialogues and exchanges of ideas and actions that lead to better governance, in India and in Egypt.



Day 4 - Session 2: Citizens Involvement in Monitoring of PMGSY Roads
(Prime Minister's Rural Roads Scheme)
Mr Basil Liongs, Head - Citizen Action and Support Group, PAC
Mr Pankil Goswami, Program Officer, PAC

Mr Basil explained the need for, and importance of, citizen participation by which an empowered citizen
displays greater involvement and responsiveness to public policies, seeks improved services, and these
in turn influence outcomes. Positive changes can be brought about in framing and improving policies by
collaborating with government and their agencies, constructively engaging citizens, partnering with
grassroots organizations, permitting the flow of information, and through regular communication.

He said that citizens' general dissatisfaction with the roads in their communities led to the concept of
involving them in monitoring the quality of construction (and maintenance thereafter) of rural roads
that are meant to serve the citizens, and improve their lives. He presented PAC's project that involved
- collaboration with all stakeholders - GoI / NRRDA / SRRDAs, rural communities, local NGOs and
  contractors, domain experts
- design and development of simple tools that ordinary citizens could understand, and use - these had
  inputs from domain experts and were based on quality parameters set by the government
- training of citizens to enable them monitor the quality of roads constructed (and maintained) under
  the national rural roads scheme, and provide regular, structured reports
- presentation of findings to NRRDA and SRRDAs
- corrective actions taken by the Government and its agencies based on the findings / learning
- establishment of grievance redress mechanisms to address issues identified by citizens

and NRRDA are satisfied with the results and have expanded project implementation to monitor 140
roads in seven states.

Day 4 - Session 3: Climate Change Score Card (CCSC)
Mr Arvind L Sha, Environmental Governance Group, PAC
Ms Priyanka Agarwal, Environmental Governance Group, PAC

Mr Arvind highlighted PAC's focus on constructive engagement “to move environment research away
from a top-down, extractive and information gathering process to a participatory, bottom-up and
inclusive process to ensure sustainable development”. Some of the social accountability tools developed
and used by PAC in monitoring and evaluation of environment related issues are: Climate Change
Scorecard (CCSC), Citizen Led EIA, Green Manifesto, and PAC Waste Tracker

He focused on the approach and processes involved in applying CCSCs, an innovative SA tool that
supports communities with evidence and rationale to prioritize issues on planning adaptation to climate
and environment degradation. CCSC considers three important dimensions - Society, Climate and
Governance, provides a platform for dialogue with relevant stakeholders based on the knowledge
generated, and helps in evidence-based policy decisions. He shared the findings from some of the PAC’s
projects. He explained how cognitive science is used to capture uncertain/hazy knowledge, develop
qualitative impact models of vulnerability, and link casual relationships between variables.

For a better understanding of how CCSCs can be helpful in the Egyptian context, participants were given
a hands on exercise to draw Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM), a practical and potentially powerful tool used
for anticipatory action research by incorporating multiple stressors for planning. Participants discussed
and prioritised food security as the sector in Egypt that is most vulnerable to climate change. They then
formed two groups, representing the "farming community" and "government". Each group developed

an FCMs; they listed all variables that affect food security, identified relationships (negative and positive,
if any) between the variables, and assigned a relationship strength value for each, ranging from 0 (no
impact) to 1 (very high impact). The maps were then analysed by the PAC team and findings were
shared.




"Rules/regulations" and "water pollution" were considered as the most important factors hampering
food security by the "government" group; the "farming community" group considered crop production,
food availability and well-being of the people to be critical. The exercise demonstrated how FCMs can
capture the similarities and differences between the priorities and perceptions of various stakeholders,
and based on their analyses, how policy options under different scenarios can be generated.

Day 4 - Session 4:

a) Measuring SDGs progress with a focus on Health, Nutrition and Education
Dr C K Mathew, Senior Fellow, PAC
Dr K Sanjeev, PAC

Dr Mathew outlined India's progress in achieving SDGs in Education (which he and Dr Sanjeev covered),
and Health and Nutrition (that Dr Shreelata Seshadri focused on).

He talked about India's independence in 1947, the fragmented and diverse education "systems" that
prevailed then, the major reforms that led to standardisation across the country, the shifting of
education from the state list to the concurrent list by which GoI took over the power to make changes,
and the extremely important introduction of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Despite such landmark changes, he said India’s education system is still in a dismal state. Recruitment
and deployment of teachers and school management is marred with political interference; there is great
imbalance with rural areas still in dire need of teachers; numbers of children far outweighs the number
of schools available; corrective steps have been ad hoc and sporadic.

     31     TOOLS IN MONITORING & EVALUATION March 7-11, 2017 - STUDY TOUR REPORT - 27th March 2017
Dr Mathew said India’s attempt to achieve the MDGs in education by 2015 have not succeeded. While
the MDGs called for universalisation of primary education, India overstepped and included elementary
education too, resulting in 2000 in a huge influx of children to a school system that was grossly
unprepared; it took India 10 years to build the required resources. He however said that such a move
turned out to be a blessing in disguise as it created easy access to education by which there is one
primary school within every populated square kilometre, thereby laying a foundation for the future.

He said some the problems that adversely impact India’s present education system are poor quality (in
both government and private schools), absence of teacher training, exclusion of students in the most
impoverished areas, lack of monitoring and evaluation of the education system, and political
interference.

Dr Mathew pointed out that states in India which are doing well in the social sector are also doing well
in the economic sector, he gave the examples of Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim. He wondered if the same
was true for the governorates in Egypt, whereby some governorates are more developed than others
due to a well developed and robust social sector.

Dr Sanjeev presented PAC's ongoing study on ‘Development Transformation in Himachal Pradesh', one
of India's states, to examine the reasons behind the exceptional development by the state when
compared to other Indian states. The preliminary findings and learning reveal that this could be due to a
combinations of the following factors: women’s empowerment, better road connectivity, 100%
electrification, committed and transparent Government with accountability and good governance, social
cohesiveness and communal harmony, and high public awareness.

He said the study is also probing the impact of social movements, civil activism, and good governance
on gender development, and the role of women's empowerment in the State's progress.

b) From MDGs to SDGs - Implications for India’s Health, Nutrition and Education Sectors
Dr Shreelata Seshadri, Azim Premji University, Bangalore

Dr Shreelata gave an introduction about health, nutrition and education, and the linkages between
them. She mentioned GoI's major initiatives for health data collection through four rounds of the
National Family Health Survey (NFHS), with round 4 having been conducted in 2014.

She spoke of the high prevalence among children in India of malnutrition, stunting and wasting across
rural and urban settings; the effects of poverty on stunting, child development, and school achievement;
the prevalence of high maternal mortality rates (MMR); the presence of about 7.5 million low birth
weight (LBW) infants in India alone compared to 9.5 million in the rest of the world; and how the vicious
circle of all these factors results in malnutrition.

Dr Shreelata briefly covered the millennium development goals (MDGs, 2000-15) and whether, or to
what extent, these goals have been achieved. She mentioned the transition to the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs, 2015-30), discussed how these are different (or similar) to the MDGs, and
whether, and how, the objectives of the SDGs are likely to be achieved.

Day 4 - Session 5: Improving Consumer Voices and Accountability in Swachh Bharat Mission
Dr Meena Nair
Head - Participatory Governance Research Group, PAC

Dr Meena gave a brief overview of the SBM(G) programme of the GoI; the study conducted by PAC and
PAF across two large Indian states (Odisha + Tamil Nadu) over a three year period (2014 -17) on behalf
of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; the SA tools used (CRC, CRC+, CSC); the study objectives; and
the steps taken to achieve them.

She highlighted some of the key themes and learning from the study, which she said could never have
been collected, analysed or interpreted from routinely compiled statistics, data or opinions. As
examples, she explained how data demonstrates that
- beneficiaries who build their own toilets (or have them built under their supervision) have a greater
  sense of ownership, and tend to use their toilets, as compared to toilets built by contractors which
  provided little or no sense of ownership, and tend to be less used or not used at all
- beneficiary built toilets are of better quality and last longer than contractor built ones
- Swachhata Doots (messengers of cleanliness / local information providers) and Rural Sanitary Marts
  (material providers) are effective, key players whose numbers need to be increased and who need to
  be better supported in order facilitate and speed up building of toilets
- repairs and maintenance of toilets (chart below) are important aspects that also need to be
  communicated to enable sustainability of the programme

Dr Meena spoke about the need for advocacy and briefly covered some of the advocacy initiatives.

Day 5 - Session 1: Discussions and Presentations

a) Case study discussion and presentation

Based on the field visit to the KRIES school on Day 2, the two IDSC groups discussed amongst themselves
and prepared their proposals and plans for monitoring and evaluation of SWD run schools and hostels.
These included the scope of their study, objectives, tools to be used for conducting the study, sampling
plan, various stakeholders to be interviewed, timelines, reporting and dissemination.

The two groups presented their proposals and plans. PAF team provided inputs to the teams on how
they could make their studies more comprehensive and robust. PAF then briefly presented the actual
questionnaires that had been used to conduct a study of SWD run schools and hostels. These helped the
IDSC team to understand the nuances of questionnaire design and sampling.

b) Presentation of Study Tour Note - from learning to action

Based on a template provided by PAF (see Annexure 2), participants presented a basic structure of the
Study Tour Note that they would place before the IDSC management for consideration. These covered
the potential sectors and programmes for which monitoring and evaluation could be piloted, and the SA
tools that could be used. PAF team provided inputs to the teams on how they could refine their Notes,
after the teams return to Egypt, to make their proposals more comprehensive and robust.

Day 5 - Session 2: ‘Way Forward’
Ravishankar Rao
Executive Director, PAF

Mr Ravishankar Rao summarised the learning from the Study Tour for both IDSC and PAF and presented
his views on the way forward. He encouraged participants to share what they had learnt on the Study
Tour with IDSC's management, and through them, with their colleagues / teams / departments,
especially those that had attended the 2016 Workshop in Al Sokhna.

Problem solving in the Egyptian context, he said, is a gradual process which requires careful planning.
These involve selecting one or two sector/s and programmes which need urgent reforms but are not
controversial; understanding the needs and concerns of all stakeholders, and arriving at a common

purpose; and clearly defining the problems, objectives, and scope of work. Building trust with all
stakeholders and obtaining their "buy-in", he said, are extremely important. This is possible when they
are aware (and convinced) that the use of Social Accountability tools by unbiased / neutral organisations
to independently assess the functioning of government's social development programs and delivery of
public services, including gathering feedback from scientifically and randomly sampled citizens (ie:
beneficiaries of programmes and users of services), is not aimed at finding fault with or auditing or
investigating anyone. Studies must be true mirrors that reflect ground realities - the good, the average,
and the not so good aspects of governance and delivery, so that they lead to reforms and
improvements.

Mr Ravishankar said that governments often do a lot of good work but this is either not publicised, or
not "marketed" as effectively as they should be. As a result, citizens do not always get to know the many
positive measures that governments take to serve them. Regular, effective, two way, evidence based
communication is therefore key to building trust between citizens and governments, and within
government's own organisations, in order to get 'buy-in" from citizens and for motivating the
government machinery to do better.

Mr Ravishankar thanked all participants for visiting India / Bangalore / PAF; IDSC for facilitating the
Study Tour; and the World Bank for supporting it. He wished participants and IDSC success in fully
benefiting from the learning of the 2016 Workshop and the 2017 Study Tour. PAF, he said, will be happy
and willing to collaborate in future too with IDSC and WB in any manner that is appropriate to the
Egyptian context and helps the Government and citizens of Egypt.

I       Pre-Study Tour preparation ("homework") for participants:

The following preparations will enable participants to have a more effective study tour:

       1) Review the notes / presentations on sessions from the May 2016 workshop on Social
          Accountability tools and their applicability in participatory M&E.
       2) Review the discussions and notes from Day 5 (the last day) of the above workshop (May 26th,
          2016) when specific SDGs were chosen and groups worked on applying the SA tools to
          measurement of the chosen SDGs.
       3) Discuss with the World Bank TA team as to which of these SDG/s they would like to choose; and,
          for the selected SDG/s, which sector(s) will be chosen for implementation of PM&E using the
          tools discussed (if relevant, in combination with any other tools).
       4) Finalise the shortlisted programs chosen for PM&E implementation (2 to 3 programs).

II          Study Tour Note:

A format / structure for the Note to be prepared by participants at the end of the tour is given below.

Part II: Plan for PM&E Implementation using the SA Tool(s)

The following steps in Part II can be discussed and completed during the study tour (Days 5/6), and
refined after return to Egypt:

1)    Each group (IDSC / MOIIC / IDSC Sub-Teams) to pick a Sector + program from the above list
2)    Present justifications for picking the sector + program
3)    Present the objectives / goals of the PM&E component of the above program
4)    Choose the tools that will be used [this can be done by Day 5 or 6 of the study tour] and a tentative
      study design (eg: quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods and, type if known)
5)    Present justifications / reasoning for the tools selected
6)    Mention geographic scope of the PM&E exercise (eg: whether all Governorates, or some selected /
      sampled).
7)    Based on prior experience and / or exercises from the May 2016 Workshop, present a sampling plan
      and sample sizes for the PM&E exercise.
8)    Present an implementation plan for the PM&E component, along with a timeline
9)    Discuss in the Note all resources required for the implementation of the PM&E study, including
      technical, financial and personnel resources; and, how they will be mobilized
10)   Discuss whether more than one program can be combined into one PM&E exercise (eg: same
      sample populations can be involved in measuring two different programs).

Part I and Part II together will form the Note for each group / sub group. The multiple notes can be
combined into one note if required or kept as separate notes. WB TA to decide on the format of the final
note. Any other inputs / additions can be added to the outline above.
