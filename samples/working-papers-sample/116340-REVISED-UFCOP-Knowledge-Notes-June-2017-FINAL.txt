SUMMARY
The number of people living in flood-prone areas is estimated to be 1.3 billion by 2050, or
15 percent of the global population. This number represents an increase of 0.3 billion over
the present (Ligtvoet et al. 2014) and takes into account both river and coastal flooding.
Looking at river flooding specifically, the World Resources Institute (2015) has demonstrated that this
hazard affects 21 million people around the world every year. In 2030, that number could rise to 54 million
per year, with ongoing urbanization and climate change driving the increase and putting more people in
harm’s way.

While large infrastructure investments are being made to mitigate flood disaster risk,
disasters continue to take their toll, in part because of ongoing changes in land use and
land management. In rural areas, for example, agricultural fields are gradually replacing forests, and
drainage improvements for agricultural land have led to increased flood peaks. Developments have also
taken place in urban areas, where natural land cover is converted to paved, impervious surfaces over
which rainfall runs more rapidly into drains and rivers. The construction of urban drainage systems may also
release runoff more quickly into water bodies that are downstream and that may have insufficient carrying
capacity. This trend can therefore increase the risk of flooding over time.

Across regions, decision makers and at-risk populations have realized that they can no
longer afford to wait for the next flood to come. Developed countries have made progress in
instituting policy reforms and putting in place integrated solutions for flood risk management, but developing
countries too are growing more interested in implementing methods and policies for improving flood risk
management at the river basin level. This Technical Note offers substantial guidance for decision makers
tasked with considering flood management options.

The note addresses the following issues: It examines the nature of floods, focusing in particular on
the important function of flood volume retention and the conveyance of excess water out of river basins.
Based on this account, it discusses flood management options that can be implemented as part of a
proactive approach, one that seeks to avoid the disasters that may result from a “wait and see” approach.
In this context, it describes the role of flood hazard and flood risk mapping in decision making. The note
also explores the distinct roles and comparative advantages of structural and nonstructural measures in
managing flood risk. In addition, it provides guidance on flood risk assessment methodologies, including
the role of numerical simulation models and their data requirements, and also includes a summary of the
key principles of flood risk management. All these parts together serve to demonstrate the importance of
understanding flood phenomena and assessing flood risks.

To ensure that the principles outlined in this document are as actionable as possible, the key
messages are summarized here: (1) absolute flood protection in flood-prone areas is not possible or
desirable, and some calculated acceptance of “living with floods” is necessary; (2) flood risk management
investments—particularly nonstructural measures—provide an attractive economic rate of return; and (3)
flood risk management interventions may have a significant impact (e.g., increase or decrease of flood
risk) in areas outside where they are implemented.

1. INTRODUCTION
   Floods accounted for 47 percent of all weather-related disasters from 1995 to 2015,
   and affected more people than any other disaster during that period. Between 1995 and
   2015, floods affected 2.3 billion people and killed 157,000 (UNISDR/CRED 2015). During this period,
   average annual global losses due to floods amounted to almost US$20 billion. Between 2005 and
   2014, the number of floods per year also rose to an average of 171, up from an annual average of
   127 in the previous decade (figure 1).

   The number of people living in flood-prone areas is estimated to be 1.3 billion by 2050,
   or 15 percent of the global population. This number represents an increase of 0.3 billion
   over the present (Ligtvoet et al. 2014). Floods are among the most frequent hazards, and
   along with other related hydrological hazards they are becoming more prominent. Flood disasters
   continue to occur even after large infrastructure investments are made to mitigate their effects.

   When risks related to river and coastal floods (which are a major source of evolving
   hazard) are combined with population increase and rapid urbanization, it is clear that
   an increasing number of communities are being placed at risk. According to the World
   Resources Institute (2015), river floods affect 21 million people around the world every year. By
   2030, that number could rise to 54 million, with ongoing urbanization, population growth, inadequate
   maintenance of flood management infrastructure, and climate change driving the increase and
   putting more and more people in harm’s way (figure 2).

     In spite of large infrastructure investments made to mitigate disaster risk, disasters
     continue to take their toll. One of the principal causes is the continuing changes in land use
     and land management. Rapid urbanization and development of industrial estates have significantly
     increased flood hazard and exposure, while efforts to reduce vulnerability have only fractionally
     compensated this increase. In rural areas, agricultural fields are gradually replacing forests, and
     drainage improvements for agricultural land have led to increased flood peaks. In urban areas, the
     principal problem is that natural land is converted to paved surfaces over which storm water runs
     more rapidly into drains and rivers. The increased speed of runoff leads to higher runoff peaks in the
     downstream drainage channels. In addition, improvement of existing urban drainage systems often
     contributes to increased peak flows, as such systems may release storm water quicker than before.
     These increased peak flows may damage infrastructure, such as bridges, or lead to overtopping
     and failure of embankments. In the longer run, climate change impacts are expected to accentuate
     higher peak flows in rivers and backflow from the sea. To mitigate the negative impacts, good
     planning and the construction of compensatory infrastructure is required.

     Across regions, decision makers and at-risk populations have realized that they can
     no longer afford to wait for the next flood to come. Attitudes are currently shifting; there is
     growing recognition of the need to better understand what causes floods and what can be done
     to minimize damages and losses. On one hand, this shift in attitude is leading to improved flood
     protection systems, primarily structural interventions. On the other hand, there is a realization that
     despite these investments a residual risk will always exist. Thus to a certain extent, governments
     and communities have to adopt a “living with floods” approach and to invest in measures—primarily
     nonstructural measures—that reduce losses in the inevitable event of a flood.

Managing flood risk is challenging due to the different
responses required for different types of floods. Floods
present themselves in different forms, such as flooding of                                    Objectives of This

flooding of urban areas. Managing these different types of

                                                                                    (with a particular focus on river flood
Furthermore, floods can have a direct relation to another                           risks) with the objective of providing
disaster—and vice versa (GFDRR 2016). For example, floods                           guidance to government officials,
and droughts are opposites and partially conflicting in their
management, but drought conditions could increase the risk                          specialists, and other stakeholders

soils absorb rainfall less easily, increasing the likelihood of                     in flood risk management. It seeks
flooding if a drought-stricken area is hit by storms. Other
related sets of hazards also exist: Tsunamis are directly related                   to inform and facilitate the sets of

coincide because of typhoons’ strong winds and very moist
air. Finally, floods and landslides often occur jointly as a result
of heavy rainfall.

    The note is structured in the following way: S e c t i o n 2 examines the nature of floods, with a
    focus on the important function of flood volume retention and the conveyance of excess water out
    of river basins. This account forms the basis for the discussion in s e c t i o n 3 on flood management
    options that can be implemented as part of a proactive approach, one that seeks to avoid the
    disasters that may result from a “wait and see” approach. This section also describes the role of
    flood hazard and risk mapping in decision making, as well as the distinct roles and comparative
    advantages of structural and nonstructural measures. S e c t i o n 4 provides guidance on flood risk
    assessment methodologies, including the role of numerical simulation models; s e c t i o n 5 considers
    the data requirements of these models. The note concludes with a summary of the key principles
    of flood risk management. Taken together, these parts serve to demonstrate the importance of
    understanding flood phenomena and techniques for assessing flood risks.

    To ensure that the principles outlined in this note are as actionable as possible,
    the key messages are summarized here:

    1. Absolute flood protection in flood-prone areas is not possible or desirable, and some
    	   calculated acceptance of “living with floods” is necessary;

    2. Flood risk management investments—particularly nonstructural measures—provide an
    	   attractive economic rate of return, depending on the actual situation in a river basin; and

    3. Flood risk management interventions may have a significant impact
    	   (e.g., increase or decrease flood risk) in areas outside where these are implemented.




    Institutional Aspects
    Management of floods—both the planning before floods and the handling of emergency
    situations—is a complex task because it involves many government agencies and other
    stakeholders. Another complication is that river basins often overlay parts of different countries,
    provinces, and municipalities, increasing the number of parties involved in managing them. Finally,
    river basins do not always have their own authorities, budgets, or mandates. These multi-jurisdictional
    aspects of river basin management may make it difficult to handle investments required for flood
    management. A first step is often to create better institutional arrangements. Compromises have to
    be found to respect the interests of many parties, and these have to be laid down in laws.

                                  The European Union (EU) Floods Directive (Directive 20 07/60/
                                  EC) is legislation from the European Parliament that sets new
                                  standards with respect to the flood-related policy of EU member

International river basins are particularly complex in terms of ownership and jurisdiction.
In many cases the need to resolve basin-related problems has led to the formation of international
river basin committees. Fortunately, many of these committees function well, such as the International
Commission for the Protection of the Rhine, established in Koblenz, Germany, and charged with (among
other tasks) implementing the EU Floods Directive on the assessment and management of flood risks,
which entered into force on November 27, 2007 (Directive 2007/60/EC; see box 1). However, river basin
committees often have a quite limited mandate.

One of the outcomes of the EU Floods Directive was the Internationally Coordinated Flood Risk
Management Plan 2015. Developed by the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine,
the plan includes states’ joint targets and measures for different areas of flood prevention and technical
flood protection (ICPR 2015) . Under this arrangement, participating states are obliged to review the
plan every six years and to update it if required. This type of cooperation seeks to ensure that countries
will not implement flood-impacting interventions in the Rhine without consulting and following up
with other riparian countries that should be party to the decision. However, many developed and
developing countries in other regions struggle to achieve this type of coordination; this is the case
even within individual countries where river basins spread across multiple provinces, administrative
zones, or regions. Vietnam offers an example of the intranational jurisdictional consequences that can
arise when several provinces share the same river basin (box 2). For a brief discussion of transboundary
flooding, see box 3.

 BOX 2. Vietnam Case Study: The Need for Integrated Disaster Risk Management at the River Basin Level

                         Water and watershed management normally requires an integrated basinwide
                         approach. Yet in Vietnam , regulation of river basins is the jurisdictional domain
          VI




                         of individual provinces: Vietnam has developed 63 administrative zones at the
            ET




                         provincial level that do not coincide with river basin boundaries. As storm

                         water and floodwater may pass freely from zone to zone, their management
                         and mitigation need to be addressed in a coordinated manner. Uncoordinated
                         activities not only affect the sustainability of water use and the health of
 natural resources within tributar y basins, but may also actually exacerbate the risks posed
 by storms and floods, particularly in downstream locations. Vietnam should move toward a
 river basin approach, specifically by putting in place river basin committees (which may be
 given a special jurisdictional status), creating basin risk maps, and mainstreaming disaster
 risk management into all river basin plans in relevant provinces (Molle and Hoanh 2009) .
 Another institutional issue to be resolved in Vietnam is the free exchange of data monitored
 or sur veyed under the jurisdiction of a particular ministr y. Making such data freely available
 to other ministries facilitates the development of reliable flood management

In most countries there is a strong need for cooperation between various water-related
stakeholders, in particular government agencies. The exploitation of multipurpose reservoirs
forms a clear example. When a reservoir is primarily used for hydropower development, there is an
interest in keeping water levels in the reservoir as high as possible. This contradicts the requirement for
the reservoir’s use in flood management, which depends on having storage capacity available. A similar
conflict of interest, though less extreme, exists for reservoirs also used for irrigation water or urban
water supply. The joint exploitation of such reservoirs requires well-defined institutional arrangements
that are embedded in laws or bilateral agreements. Fortunately, recent developments in technology
facilitate and support cooperation across agencies. For example, the current state-of-the-art in flood
forecasting technology, often operational under the responsibility of a ministry of environment, also
allows for real-time control of reservoirs under the jurisdiction of another ministry; in other words, flood
forecasting and reservoir control can quite easily be combined into the same tool, while each of the
responsible agencies maintains its own control based upon its own responsibilities.

 BOX 3. Transboundary Flooding

               A study of 1,760 river floods by Marloes H. N. Bakker (2009) found that
               “some 175 river floods were shared by two or more countries.” At the global
               level, these floods “accounted for 32% of all casualties, almost 60% of all
               affected individuals and 14% of all financial damage” (Bakker 2006) —clearly
 a sign of “the massive impacts of…transboundar y flood events on a global scale.” These
 figures might also be a sign that river basins that fall within a single countr y have better
 flood protection than transboundar y river basins. One explanation for the weaker flood
 protection in international river basins (IRBs) is that these basins lack the institutional
 capacity to deal with transboundar y floods. However, this lack of capacity may be
 linked to the absence of common budget allocation agreements for transboundar y flood
 management. Bakker (2006, 2009) found that the existing IRB institutions were dealing
 with water management in general and not merely with flooding problems. She also
 concluded that IRBs with flood-specific institutional capacity suffered less flood damage
 than IRBs without such capacity. In other words, giving sufficient attention to flooding
 issues and making sure that institutional capacity is developed can reduce the impact of
 transboundar y floods. Most likely, similar conclusions can be drawn about flood damages
 in interprovincial river basins within a countr y.



An important aspect of cooperation within a river basin is information and data sharing.
River basin planning and management demand an integrated approach in which countries, provinces,
and municipalities share information on water-related issues in basin management plans, including
water resources management, irrigation demands, urban water supply, hydropower generation,
navigation, flood management, drought management, aquaculture, and ecosystem management. For
interprovincial-level flood management in a river basin within a single country, certain cooperation
mechanisms and institutional arrangements between ministries and provincial directorates are highly
recommended and are often considered as global best practices. These are shown in figure 4.

Key Messages for Decision Makers Involved in Flood Management
Urbanization has significantly increased flood peak runoff, while recurring flooding of
agricultural land has led to production losses, food shortages, and rural undernutrition
(UNISDR/CRED 2015). As urban areas expand, particularly in Asia and Africa, tens of trillions of
dollars in infrastructure, industrial and office buildings, and homes will be increasingly at risk from
river and coastal flooding (see figure 5). The nature of disastrous floods has also changed in recent
years, with flash floods and acute riverine and coastal flooding becoming increasingly frequent. People
living in flood-prone areas are often protected (or protect themselves) against floods to some degree,
although many regions suffer a flood safety deficit. Unfortunately, the actual protection levels are not
known globally, nor are the future flood risk strategies and protection levels across the various cities
and regions of the world.

Studies of flood management projects demonstrate that it is more cost-effective to spend
money prior to a disaster than to pay for post-disaster relief and reconstruction (Hawley,
Moench, and Sabbag 2012). Put differently, these calculations show that it pays to adopt a more
proactive approach to flood management, especially if this approach focuses in part on the evaluation
of the risks associated with developments in flood-prone areas.

Suggesting that urbanization of flood-prone areas should be avoided is not a sensible
recommendation for land development; it is too simplistic and omits important
considerations, such as land availability as a limiting factor. The issue is not just how flood
damages can be avoided. The bigger issue is how the difference between benefits and costs for this
land use can be maximized. This effort should take into consideration the costs associated with the safe
use of assets and the economic and social benefits these assets provide in return. Costs associated
with providing protection against floods are just one of the many factors in the evaluation of land
development decisions, along with land acquisition, construction costs, etc.

It is for this reason that some countries have started to follow the example of the Netherlands
and build below mean sea level. Singapore, for example, is in an advanced stage of reclaiming
land from the sea for its continuing housing development on the very limited space available. The
development of flood-prone areas requires detailed studies of how damages and losses can be limited
to economically feasible levels. In other words, investments and other measures supporting flood
protection also provide benefits beyond the mitigation of flood risk and the reduction of loss when a
flood strikes. Flood protection investments also unlocks economic potential thanks to reduced risks,
and can generate development co-benefits such as ecosystem services, transportation uses, and
agricultural productivity gains, even in the absence of floods.

Flood risk management involves striking a balance between structural and nonstructural
measures (listed in figure 6).

Structural measures aim primarily at protecting a specific geographical area. The need for
protection depends on the level of flood hazard for that area and on its level of exposure, including
future or planned exposure. Exposure is relatively low for agricultural land, while it is much higher for an
industrial estate. Consequently, areas with a high economic interest require a higher level of protection
than areas with a lower economic return. The objective of structural flood management interventions
is to reduce the combined effect of flood hazard and exposure, either by lowering the peak flood levels
or by increasing the levels of protecting barriers, such as dikes. An effective way to reduce peak flood
levels is to spread the runoff of the flood volume along rivers or drainage systems over a longer time
span. In general, the growing tendency across regions is toward a more proactive approach to floods,
rather than a reactive one (see figure 7).

Reducing peak discharges and peak flood levels is a primary target in reducing flood
damages. It is often achieved by delaying runoff of storm water (see figure 8). Large-scale solutions
include constructing reservoirs in upstream river basins or improving the rules of reservoir operation in
favor of flood protection, although these approaches tend to compete with efforts to reduce drought
impact and/or generate hydropower. In urban environments, the effort to apply the same principle
(delaying the runoff of storm water) involves searching for micro-storage options. This has led to the
concept of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). The use of a large number of small-scale
interventions in the urban environment, such as the mobilization of emergency storage on parks and
playgrounds, reduces the speed of runoff and reduces peak flows in the drainage system. Usually these
solutions are multipurpose and demonstrate clear co-benefits.

Another way to reduce peak flood levels is to increase the conveyance capacity of the
system or divert floodwater. In the first place, the increased flow capacity reduces flood levels for a
given discharge. The application of this principle is observed in cities where smooth river embankments
have been constructed to reduce peak flood levels that result from the passage of peak discharges.
In other cases, flows are diverted around the city. Flooding problems are also often encountered in
cities built where rivers meet the sea (e.g., Dar es Salaam, Cap-Haïtien). These may be due to river
encroachment or sedimentation, often caused by increased sediment loads from upstream (e.g., from
garbage, construction activities, or deforestation). Floods resulting from tropical storms in smaller river
basins are hard to control by the construction of reservoirs. In these cases, the river’s flood outlet
capacity has to be at least equal to the inlet capacity, so that dredging and widening of the river in the
city or flow diversion may be the only feasible solutions to reduce flood risks. To ensure sustainable
solutions, these interventions may have to be complemented with better erosion management, or with
the construction of upstream sediment traps.

In general, flood protection interventions are best realized as water retention works in (or
at the upstream end of) flood-prone areas, whereas increased flood conveyance capacity
interventions are most effective in (or downstream of) flood-prone areas. Upstream retention
leads to a reduction in peak flows (see figure 9), with a positive flood reduction impact felt quite far
downstream. When rivers pass through cities, the peak flow will cause flooding if the flood conveyance
capacity is not sufficient to convey the flood within the river banks. However, the increased flow
capacity may also lead to higher peak flows downstream. This is no problem for cities located in the
river delta, close to the sea. At those locations the creation of capacity to convey the flood peak flows
without overtopping the river banks is often a cost-effective measure. Decision making about which
interventions to use should be based upon an integrated approach, where all options are studied and
prioritized.

An integrated approach to flood management should be based upon the development of
flood management master plans (FMMPs). Many countries follow this approach and develop
FMMPs for their river basins and update them regularly. For example, it is common practice in Hong
Kong to develop drainage master plans for small river basins and to update them approximately every
10 years.

FFMPs generally focus on reducing the negative impacts of floods, but they should also
consider possible benefits from floods. In regions that do not use fertilizers to boost agricultural
production, frequent flooding of agricultural lands brings fertilizing deposits to the fields. Along the
banks of the Licungo River in Mozambique, for example, these fertilizing floods may make production
of higher-value organic rice crops possible. In regions like this, there is a need to optimize the height
of dikes so that they prevent excessive damage to agricultural production, while still allowing the
benefits of fertilization. Dike construction technology also needs to minimize dike breaches in case of
overtopping.

In an integrated approach, FMMPs promote a good understanding of how the river and
drainage system functions. This allows for a balanced evaluation of positive and negative impacts
of structural flood management interventions, which in turn facilitates the prioritization of proposed
works. This process takes into account the positive impacts of investments along with the negative
impacts, such as possible increased flood risks in downstream areas.

One issue an FMMP should address is                            FIGURE 10. Car On 1.5 M Stilts During The 2011

reducing flood risks. Nonstructural measures                   Reduction Triggered As A Result Of Flood Warning
focus primarily on reducing the vulnerability of
people, assets, and economic values in the flood-
prone area. Early warnings, for example, give
people and businesses time to take protective
measures, such as removing equipment to higher
floors, installing temporary flood barriers, or
installing mechanisms that elevate assets above
expected floodwater levels to protect them (see
figure 10). Nonstructural measures may very well
be more cost-effective than structural measures.
In any case, as full flood protection by structural
measures is not realistic and complementary
nonstructural measures are always needed,
an FMMP should find a good balance between

measures of both types.

Nowadays, all FMMPs are based upon insight produced by numerical simulation models.
These describe the hydrological or rainfall-runoff processes, if relevant for the situation, and the
hydrodynamic processes of subsequent runoff in rivers and canals as well as over land. The inclusion
of a hydrological model depends on the need to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship. For coastal
zones and principal rivers, for example, this may not always be necessary. But in urban areas the
use of hydrological models is essential. Hydrodynamic modeling uses state-of-the-art integrated one-
dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models. The 1D models describe the flood propagation in
rivers and canals, whereas the 2D models describe the flood propagation over land, e.g., on floodplains.

Such models make it possible to understand the flood phenomena in the basin, including
how floods occur and how their most negative impacts can be mitigated. The models allow
for a quantitative evaluation of the full impacts of a number of proposed flood protection options
for the basin, and hence assist stakeholders in selecting the most cost-effective flood management
interventions. The numerical simulation models support both the design of structural measures and the
implementation of nonstructural measures.

Good-quality models require good-quality data sets. These include data sets on rainfall,
monitored water levels and discharges, bathymetry and hydraulic structure, topography, land use, flood
protection infrastructure, etc. Flood managers must be aware that monitoring of water levels and
discharges no longer focuses on their use for statistical processing alone. For model development,
monitoring is required at several locations, though over relatively short periods of time. Preferably such
periods should include extreme flood events. The collection of data needed for modeling should begin
well before the development of an FMMP     .

Currently, one of the most important data items for flood management is a good-quality
topographic map or digital elevation model (DEM). It is becoming common practice to survey
this set of data with LiDAR technology. This approach generally allows for the production of DEMs
at a vertical accuracy of 10 cm, or at least 20 cm. The LiDAR survey also provides at least basic
insight into the presence of flood-blocking elements, such as dikes, roads, railways, etc. Both these
capabilities facilitate the processing of high-quality flood hazard maps, which are an essential input for
flood management decision making. Again, the survey of such detailed data should take place before—
or at the very start of—an FMMP’s development.

Observed Trends in Flood Causes and Damages
Continuing land development, partly in flood-
prone areas, is the principal reason for frequent,                                     Figure 11. People (in millions) living in

Given that the world is changing rapidly, flood management planning must recognize that
existing river basin conditions do not represent those likely to obtain in the future. The
primary driver of change in this context is the industrialization of agricultural production, which reduces
manpower needs in rural areas. Another driver is the population growth and expansion of industrial
production in urban areas (figure 12). Land in urban areas is not always available at flood-safe locations,
and industries and their employees often settle in flood-prone areas because they don’t understand
flood risks very well (Kocornik-Mina et al. 2015). This concentration of industrial production in flood
zones is the main cause of the increasing trend in flood damages over the past decades. The creation of
space for urban expansion and industrial estates requires thorough planning based upon the outcomes
of FMMPs, which should be updated regularly and take the following into consideration:

      •	 Socioeconomic developments and land use changes associated with them

      •	 Drainage infrastructure for new developments in land use, including impacts on the
         existing drainage system

      •	 Transportation infrastructure (as there is often competition for land needed for
         drainage and transport)

      •	 Impacts of climate changes

     Understanding the fundamental behavior of river basin floods is a key component in
     identifying solutions to mitigate their negative impacts. Floods may be caused by factors
     originating within the river basin or by external influences. Figure 13 gives an overview of possible
     flood-forcing factors.

Characteristics and Origin of Flood Events

River and coastal floodplain floods occur when the river or coastal channel does not have
sufficient conveyance capacity for the flow that has to pass. In these situations, floodwaters
seek a route over land. The flow may pass through areas that are used for urban settlements, industrial
production, agriculture, or many other activities. Such flow may be very damaging, in particular when
it comes unexpectedly.

Damage depends greatly on the speed with which a flood arrives. Most damaging in terms of human
life are flash floods, which are often defined as floods that arrive within six hours after the start of a
driving force such as heavy rainfall. Even in countries with a relatively good level of flood protection,
flash floods may lead to loss of life. Such floods occur mostly in relatively steep mountain areas, though
they also occur in urban areas. In the city of Barranquilla in Colombia, for example, some streets are
used as drains to evacuate runoff from rainstorms. An appropriate subsurface drainage system was
never built. Thus casualties occur every year when people are surprised by heavy rainfalls.

Regular floods are less threatening to human life than flash floods, though they often cause
substantial economic damages, despite the longer time available to prepare for damage-reducing
actions. Floods’ speed of passage depends on the conveyance capacity of rivers and the availability
of flood volume storage. If a river has a high discharge capacity, floodwater will pass quickly in a
downstream direction. Usually this is an advantage for the upstream community, though it may have
negative consequences for communities downstream, where there are high peak discharges. If there
are bottlenecks in the river system, such as narrow channel sections or bridge spans, local flooding
may occur.

The availability of storage in the form of floodplains or reservoirs delays the speed of flood
propagation. Not only does it give downstream communities more time to prepare for upcoming
floods, it also leads to lower peak discharges and consequently lower flood levels.


The Threat of Peak Discharges

Extreme rainfall occurring on a river basin leads to high discharges in the basin’s rivers. The
catchment runoff can be represented in the form of a discharge or runoff hydrograph, under extreme
circumstances called a flood wave. The total volume of catchment runoff is determined by integrating
the discharge over the period of the flood wave passage. This volume to be drained equals the rainfall
depth, integrated over the receiving area and multiplied by the runoff coefficient from the catchment. The
higher the rainfall depth over a given period of time, the higher this runoff coefficient. This phenomenon
is therefore a nonlinear process that may change abruptly during a flood situation. This is the reason
that increased rainfall due to climate change may be more damaging than was originally thought.

The period of such flood waves is short for fast-reacting catchments and longer for slower-
reacting catchments. Figure 14 shows that for the same runoff volume, a fast-reacting catchment
has a higher peak discharge than that
of a slower-reacting catchment. The
peak discharge is a very sensitive                FIGURE 14. Influence Of The Flood Wave Parameter

decreasing the peak discharge. This

upstream and downstream water levels, gives an approximate indication of the flow energy loss at
the bridge, and suggests the flood flow’s difficulty in passing this point. The design of the bridges
did not take into account correct information on the hydrological system of the Licungo basin. Lack
of hydrological data during the design of the bridges was most likely the reason why the conveyance
capacity required underneath the bridges was underestimated.

The risk of such failures may be reduced significantly if flood managers take timely action
to reduce peak flood discharges. As demonstrated by figure 14, this reduction can be achieved by
stretching the flood wave over a longer period of time. Effective interventions are based upon delaying
runoff from the upstream part of a catchment, e.g., through retention storage, reforestation, changed
agricultural practices, etc. In any case, at the time the bridges shown in figure 16 were designed, the
hydrological conditions could have been estimated better on the basis of appropriate prior monitoring
and statistical analyses.


Integrated River Basin System

In a river basin, runoff water generated by rainfall usually moves from the affected area
down to the basin outlet. This can be another river, a lake, the sea, or the ocean. Hence there may
be basinwide consequences from interference in the river system, such as through land use change,
construction of reservoirs, changes in the river discharge capacity, flow diversion, or any change in the
basin’s water management, in particular flood management. Interference may also have morphological
impacts on rivers and may affect the basin ecosystem.

Flood management should be an integral part of the overall water resources management
for a river basin. Flood management may lead to conflict with other water-related interests, however.
Most striking is the conflict between those who wish to use reservoirs for hydropower generation and
those who wish to use them for flood control. Energy produced at a hydroelectric plant is linearly related
to two factors: (1) the water volume available; and (2) the water level in the reservoir. Consequently, a
higher water level in the reservoir leads to a higher energy production for the same volume of water
available. For this reason, a hydropower company has an interest in maintaining the highest possible
reservoir water level. Flood managers on the other hand would prefer to keep the reservoir empty (see
box 4). Similar conflicts of interest occur when a reservoir is used both for drought (irrigation) and
flood control.

Operating rules for reservoirs seek to find the most appropriate balance between such
competing interests. Flood-forecasting systems have proven to be very useful as a basis for real-time
control of the reservoirs. They may be particularly useful in cases where conflicting interests have to be
managed. Improved meteorological forecasts and monitoring on the basis of satellite images, numerical
weather models, weather radar systems, and state-of-the-art ground stations also have increased the
lead time in forecasting river basin rainfall. In conjunction with recently improved hydrological modeling
capabilities, these allow a reservoir manager to use the longer-range runoff forecast to improve decision
making on the operation of gates (see box 4). Such improved forecasts enable an earlier release of
water from reservoirs if such action is needed to create space for the floodwater, while also providing
lower losses to hydropower production or irrigation water stocks.

This example of conflicting interests demonstrates the need for flood management plans
to consider all river basin interests. Likewise, flood management should be a component of any
overall river basin management plan. It should not necessarily be the leading component, though neither
should it be neglected. Unfortunately, the terms of reference for river basin studies do not always pay
enough attention to the issue of floods.

                         Dang Quoc Khanh, the provincial mayor, “Water released from hydropower

                         able to handle the situation.” a

 Without a proper investigation of the circumstances, it is difficult to judge whether this claim
 is correct. In any case, the large rainfall depth released by Typhoon Sarika would have caused
 substantial damage even in the absence of the hydropower reser voir. It is quite possible,
 though, that the management of reser voir releases did aggravate the flood situation. Given
 this uncertainty, an investigation by an independent expert team, supported by numerical
 model simulations to demonstrate the impact of applied reser voir operation rules, should
 be undertaken. It would also be helpful to install a flood forecasting system for this basin
 that enables the simulation of “what-if” scenarios for dam operation rules on the basis of
 forecasted rainfall. Such a system could have prompted an earlier release of reser voir water
 to reduce the impacts of the peak flow during the passage of the typhoon. The case also
 demonstrates the importance of having institutional arrangements in place to guarantee the
 interests of all stakeholders.

Role of Floodwater Storage

In a river basin, the principal reason for creating storage for floodwater is reducing flood
peak discharge values further downstream and slowing the propagation speed of flood
waves. The reduction of flood peak discharge values, in turn, leads to a reduction of maximum flood
levels and the associated damages and losses. It also leads to lower construction costs for flood defenses
and hydraulic structures, which as a rule are designed to protect the floodplains from peak flood values.
Lowering the speed of flood wave propagation contributes to a further reduction of flood peak discharge
values. It has the additional benefit of giving downstream areas more time to prepare for an upcoming flood.

In many river basins, one of the problems associated with floods is that dikes or
embankments, constructed to protect parts of the floodplain from inundation, also reduce
the storage capacity of the river. Although these dikes provide local protection, the resulting higher
peak discharges increase flood problems further downstream. For this reason, various governments have
changed their policy on flood protection from site-specific measures to a more integrated approach that
incorporates nonstructural measures in addition to structural ones. And if the construction of dikes is
judged to be the best option for local flood protection, sound policy dictates that storage compensation
has to be constructed in order to neutralize the increased flood peak discharges caused by those dikes.

The impact of newly constructed storage has to be studied carefully. Adding storage can change
flood wave speeds, meaning that flood waves from different tributaries in the basin could amplify each
other more than they did in the absence of additional storage. In other words, although usually the
construction of reservoirs leads to reduced flooding, it could in some cases make the downstream
flood problem worse than before. It is now common practice to use mathematical model simulations
to study the impacts of newly constructed storage in the river basin—and indeed all flood management
interventions—in an integrated way.

In-line retention storage is created by constructing a dam across the river and leaving
a fixed opening at the riverbed level, which limits its capacity to pass high discharges.
During high floods, the river floodplain upstream of the dam will be filled with floodwater to delay
runoff. The dam will also be equipped with a spillway to pass extreme peak discharges, which would
otherwise destroy the dam. In principle, the lower opening size or the spillway opening could also be
controlled with movable gates. Reservoir dimensions, inlet or outlet structure parameters, and their
control strategy are determined on the basis of mathematical model simulations, which are used to
refine best estimates initially made with simple hand calculations. Combining these interventions with
a flood forecasting system enables further optimization of the retention facility’s function.

Role of Channel Conveyance Capacity

Natural river channels have been formed over periods of thousands of years. The shape of
their profiles is the result of morphological processes forming the riverbed and sediment depositions on
their floodplains, with natural levees generally near the main channel. Flooding of the floodplain occurs
when the capacity of the principal river channel is not high enough to convey extreme discharges.

The spreading of floodwater on the floodplain also implies that during the passage of
the flood wave, the further rise of the water level in the river is slowing down. In these
circumstances, the discharge capacity of the river can no longer rise fast enough to convey increasing
discharges coming in from upstream. A tipping point is reached when flooding of the floodplain can
easily and rapidly increase. Beyond such a tipping point, a relatively modest increase in rainfall depth
on the catchment can lead to an unexpectedly large extent of flooding. This phenomenon can aggravate
the impacts of increased rainfall depths associated with climate change. The construction of dikes
along the principal river channel shifts the tipping point to higher water levels.

The conveyance capacity of a river channel is a function of cross-sectional area, average
water depth, and channel roughness. These three parameters can be used to increase channel
conveyance capacity, where needed. The cross-sectional area of a river can be increased by increasing
its width and/or depth. Increasing river depth is the most effective way to increase conveyance capacity.
Each cubic meter of sediment removed from the channel bed is more effective in increasing channel
conveyance capacity than a similar volume removed for widening the cross-section or for creating
parallel channels in the floodplain. The reason is that increased depth increases the flow velocity over
the complete depth, which adds to the capacity beyond what results from the increase in the cross-
sectional area.

However, changing the riverbed to increase its channel conveyance capacity can have various
negative impacts, which have to be investigated before any interventions are authorized.
Local deepening of alluvial channels will destabilize the morphological equilibrium, changing bed
levels both upstream and downstream of that location. Expert advice on the sustainability of such
interventions, and on possible negative impacts, should be sought. Lowering river channel bed levels
leads to lower water levels, which may affect groundwater levels and in turn damage buildings and/
or harm agricultural production along the river. Moreover, the intervention may lead to increased salt
intrusion from the sea and affect biodiversity in the receiving coastal waters.

Morphological changes can also influence the roughness of the riverbed and hence the
discharge capacity of the river. The roughness of alluvial river channels is mostly determined by
the bed characteristics under the influence of complex morphological processes. Changes in channel
conveyance capacity are also caused by other interventions in the river cross-section. For example,
river training for navigation leads to smaller cross-sectional areas and changes in roughness of the
riverbed. The often-applied solution of constructing groins may decrease river conveyance capacity, as
intentionally reducing the cross-sectional area increases the flow velocities. However, the situation is
sometimes more complex, and the construction of groins has reportedly led to an increased capacity
in some instances. In any case, interventions of this kind require consultation with experts to evaluate
their likely impacts on floods.

For drainage channels, roughness is an important parameter. When a high discharge capacity is
required and available space is limited, such as in urban environments, channels are often lined with concrete.
Thus after various floods in the city center, Singapore’s Public Utility Board decided in 2012 to cover the walls of
a critical culvert with polymer lining. The lining was installed in a section along Orchard Road of more than 1 km
in length and covered the much rougher weathered concrete wall surface. An alternative solution would have
required closing part of an already highly congested traffic route for a long period of time.

The opposite of roughness reduction takes place when a friendlier-appearing vegetation cover
replaces concrete-lined drainage channels as part of an eco-restoration project. Detailed model
calibration in Hong Kong revealed that the discharge capacity of these so-called green channels would be three
times lower than that of concrete-lined channels. In practice there is often no space available for such green
interventions.

Flood management interventions related to increasing channel conveyance capacity are
most appropriate in the downstream parts of river basins. Downstream populations may be
interested in draining water quickly to prepare for more floodwater to come (see Box 6). A similar
measure applied in the upstream part of a river basin will increase flood peaks and also increase flood
damages and losses downstream. In case such upstream intervention is unavoidable—e.g., if a local
river constriction must be removed—current best practice is to design compensatory measures in the
form of additional flood retention space.

                           300 thousand is located at the mouth of the rivers Haut du Cap and Any. In

                           2012, 2014 and 2016 large parts of the city were flooded at depths of up to
                           2 m, impacting in each case around 100 thousand inhabitants. In November
 2012 a total rain depth of 408 mm was recorded over a period of 2 days. Most damaging was
 in all cases the runoff from the upstream river basin, which has a total size of approximately
 150 km2. The city has a central lagoon with an area of approximately 1.5 km2, far too small to
 provide retention to reduce incoming flood peaks. For the large rain depth coming to runoff,
 the construction of upstream retention would at best ser ve as a complementar y structural
 flood management option.

 The situation of Cap-Haïtien provides a typical case where a flood reduction solution is
 primarily found by increasing the river discharge capacity, in particular that of the outlet to
 the sea. Currently, financing is procured to solve the unacceptable flooding situation in a
 phased approach, starting at its most downstream river section. To fully prevent floods in the
 city, it has to be made sure that the river passing through the city has a sufficient discharge
 capacity to convey the peak discharges arriving at the upstream end of the city. This implies
 dredging of the river which has lost a significant part of its discharge capacity, primarily due
 to encroachment and garbage deposition.


3. FLOOD MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
The Impossibility of Totally Avoiding Floods
Traditionally, human settlement and economic developments were attracted toward rivers and coastal
zones, as water provided the most attractive transport routes for goods and services. Unfortunately,
these zones were also most exposed to the threat of floods. For many human activities, space could
be found on higher ground. However, as populations grow and economic activities expand, they move
toward flood-prone areas. This trend appears to continue even in an era when road and railway transport
offers feasible alternatives to navigation.

                to at least support drainage by gravity. Flood protection and its associated costs
            M




                appear to be only one of the factors at play in the planning of urban expansion.
                The cost for flood protection would most likely be lower if the city expanded to
                higher ground toward the west. Flood hazard and risk mapping planned for Ho
 Chi Minh City will determine the level of flood protection that is economically most attractive
 for the existing urban area and the expansion zones.



Full flood protection is economically not feasible. Appropriate flood management focuses on
maximizing the benefits of living in flood-prone areas and not just on minimizing flood damages. Floods
are unavoidable; beyond the probable 1-in-100-year flood there is always the possibility of a 1-in-1,000-
year flood and beyond.

The question is where the optimum investment is found. This optimum varies from location to
location and depends on flood hazards, economic activities, and the human lives at stake. Figure 18
shows the optimum level of flood investments for a relatively high-risk area such as the Netherlands.
The figure reflects the principle that at any location in the world, an optimum allowable frequency
of flooding can be defined. It also demonstrates that a “do nothing” option in flood management is
not attractive, as small investments that decrease the frequency of floods—usually investments in
structural measures—already lead to a substantial rate of return on investment. However, the figure
also shows that beyond an optimum investment point, further investments become less attractive. In
other words, there will always be a residual risk of flooding that has to be accepted on the basis of
sound economic principles. Here the value of nonstructural investments comes in, as flood forecasts
and emergency support information can considerably reduce unavoidable losses.

Unfortunately, there are cases when allowing these “acceptable” floods would lead to
many casualties. For example, some parts of the western Netherlands are nearly 7 m below mean
sea level. Thus flood protection in parts of the Netherlands is based on an allowable flood frequency
of 1 in 10,000 years. The 2005 Katrina flooding of New Orleans demonstrated that for areas below sea
level, a much lower flood frequency is acceptable than for standard river floodplain situations, where
the United States applies a 1-in-100-year allowable flood frequency. Similar exceptions to standard rules
apply to conditions with very high river dikes and high dams containing large reservoirs.

In dam construction it is common practice to provide an extremely high level of security
against failure, for example by applying a high safety factor in the design of the spillway
capacity, in particular for high dams. Engineers use the concept of probable maximum flood—that
is, the largest flood that could conceivably occur at the outlet of a reservoir. This terminology might
give the impression that such a flood could never occur. But this is not true. In the 1980s, the spillway
capacity of the Warragamba Dam in New South Wales, Australia, had to be doubled urgently when
new analysis of more recently monitored data showed that the required capacity had been severely
underestimated at the time of its design and construction. The lesson learned is that the estimate of a
probable maximum flood may give a false impression about real safety. Thus the Netherlands designs
the crest level of its most critical sea dikes at an overtopping frequency of 1 in 10,000 years.

However, more recent studies suggest that a dike-level criterion alone does not guarantee
safety at such frequency. New studies in the Netherlands, based upon a full probability analysis,
considered all possible failure mechanisms of dikes and other protection elements surrounding flood-
prone areas in order to arrive at a real 1-in-10,000-year security level. These analyses have made
clear that additional interventions in the flood protection system are needed. Despite all the existing
investments, the probability that floods will strike the Netherlands’ population and infrastructure is still
near 1 percent during a lifetime. So even with this very high protection level, floods can never be totally
avoided. This truth was recognized many decades ago by Johan van Veen, the pioneer of the Dutch Delta
Works, who wrote: “One day, with a sigh of relief, we will give up this country to the tempestuous sea.”
The statement, of course, was made well before the effects of climate change were first mentioned.

The reason to adopt the high safety criteria in the given examples is the massive volume
of water that could be released in a short time and the subsequent high flood depths that
would occur. If the Warragamba Dam (Australia) failed, it would inundate a large floodplain—an area
that in recent years has been rapidly urbanized—at a depth of up to 25 m. In the Netherlands, flood
depths could be as high as 7 m, and flood damages and loss of life would be enormous in the densely
populated areas behind the sea dikes.

Most areas in the world are above mean sea level and are not threatened by massive
volumes and depths of released water. For this reason, a commonly adopted optimum for flood
security is the 1-in-100-year event. This is the common standard for residential areas in the United
States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Where the 1-in-100-year criterion is
applied, the probability of experiencing a flood during a lifetime is higher than 50 percent. Deviations
from the 1-in-100-year criterion are often adopted for special zones, such as agricultural and other rural
zones; in these areas lower standards are accepted. The choice of safety standard levels is based on
weighing costs of flood protection against the protection’s benefits. For example, table 1 shows the
flood protection standards applied in the United Kingdom. Because of the scale of potential flood
damage, an exception has been made for the Thames Barrier and associated tidal defenses, which are
designed to a 1-in-1,000-year standard of protection.

Proactive Versus Reactive Approach

Most countries have developed their flood defense system in a reactive way. In fact, there
was no other way to determine safety levels in the era before numerical simulation models. When
determining flood levels in rivers and along coasts was impossible, people relied on the best guess for
estimating required dimensions of flood defense structures. This is how dikes were constructed in the
Netherlands for 1,000 years before simulation models were introduced.

The reactive approach has nearly always led to shortsighted solutions. Dike crest levels were
constructed too low, lateral slopes were too steep, and dikes were positioned too close to the river in
order to maximize the protected area. In the early 20th century, the German playwright Bertolt Brecht
insightfully noted: “The river that drags everything is known as violent but nobody calls violent the
margins that arrest him.” The lesson is that the river needs its own space, which is why the Dutch
introduced the concept “room for the river.” If this space is not given, the river takes it back on its own.
This has happened many times in the past, not only along the Dutch rivers and coasts but in many other
countries as well. Until better research and planning practices were introduced, dikes were periodically
repaired and “built better.” But it was only a matter of time until the next disaster occurred.

Overall, the reactive approach to flood management has been very expensive and has led
to many casualties. An example of its high costs is the 2011 flooding of Bangkok. This flood, which a
Stanford University study estimated as having a return period of 30–75 years, led to damage estimated
by the World Bank at US$45 billion (Meehan 2012) and to approximately 800 casualties. A flood of
comparable magnitude that occurred in 1942 did far less damage; the reason for the huge losses in
2011 is the enormous expansion of the city and the large industrial estates built over the past decades
in the Chao Phraya floodplain. With the continued growth of the city, similar floods in the future will
yield even higher losses.

Given continuous physical and spatial changes to rivers and surrounding areas, flood risks
should be continually monitored through the development and updating of river basin
master plans. After the 2011 flood, the Thai government proposed a US$10 billion investment to avoid
similar flooding in the future. The investment included plans for diversion canals around Bangkok, new
reservoirs upstream, and two large flood retention schemes (World Bank 2012). Mathematical model
simulations demonstrated that with this investment a similar flood could be contained in the future. If
the investment had been made earlier, it would have produced an attractive economic rate of return,
especially in light of ongoing development in the area. Unfortunately, political developments in this
country have delayed the realization of the plans.

The case of Thailand nevertheless shows that a proactive approach to flood management
is preferable to a reactive approach. (This has been the experience in New Orleans as well; see
box 8). The Thailand case also demonstrates that any solution to flood problems requires combining a
variety of possible interventions. The final decision on interventions depends on the best rate of return

is never an easy solution to the problem of managing floods, and it is wise to involve stakeholders at
an early stage of the decision-making process. The outcome of this process depends on the evaluation
of the economic and social benefits the various options deliver. Mathematical model simulations and
subsequent flood risk analyses provide an important basis for decisions on flood mitigation investments.

 city’s protection to a 1-in-100-year level. In 2013, another (less intense) hurricane, Hurricane Isaac,
 tested the new flood protection system and showed that the city was well protected by its new flood
 barriers. A quick post-hurricane analysis showed that damage would have been US$5–10 billion if no
 action had been taken after Hurricane Katrina. Thus, most of the investment paid off within a few years
 of the previous event!

Flood Hazard and Flood Risk
Insight into flood hazard provides the most important source of information for the planning
of new land developments in river basins. For selected flood return periods, potential flood hazard
can be presented on maps, providing spatial information on flood extent, flood depth, flood duration,
and flood flow velocities. With this information, decision makers can determine whether certain areas
are suitable for urban, industrial, or other developments. The maps also make clear that if developments
in flood-prone areas are considered advantageous, special protection measures must be taken, which
will increase investment costs.

Flood risk mapping provides a meaningful input for flood management decision making,
as derived through the relation illustrated in figure 19. In this relation, hazard is the fraction of exposure
that is at risk, e.g., as derived from the production of flood hazard maps; exposure reflects land use
with its population, building stock, and economic activities in the area; and vulnerability expresses the
fraction of that exposure that really results in damage for the given hazard. Flood risk is the result of
the combination of these three contributors. Flood risk may be reduced by reducing the impacts of any
and all of these three contributing factors, as discussed in more detail below.

Exposure reflects the economic value and people located in a flood-prone area. It represents
the maximum damage that could occur, based upon population, asset value, the value of economic
activities (such as industrial or agricultural production), the value of roads in transporting people and
goods, etc. Usually, economic values and human life at risk are evaluated separately.

Exposure and the flood hazard map together determine “hazard” as the fraction of exposure
subject to potential flood-caused losses. In addition to mapping flood hazard, the relation between
exposed value and flood parameters—such as extent, depth, duration, and flow velocities—has to
be established. These relations are stored in lookup tables. For each return period and subsequent
hazard map, these lookup tables are consulted to define the potential effect on each individual exposed
economic value, in terms of either damages or losses.

Vulnerability is the fraction of the product of hazard and exposure that would result in loss
for the given flood return period. Without any measures to reduce such potential flood damage,
the value of this factor would be equal to one. The value can be reduced if adequate measures are
taken prior to, during, or after the flood. These measures fall in the category of nonstructural measures
(figure 20).
Flood risk assessment provides the basis for evaluating meaningful flood management
investments. Flood risk as defined above represents economic losses for a specific return period.
However, all possible return periods may lead to damages and economic losses. These are usually small
for floods that occur frequently and high for floods that are rare. To evaluate the overall flood risk in an
area, risk is evaluated for a selected number of flood frequencies. From this evaluation the overall flood
risk can be integrated and converted to a probable yearly flood risk, as a meaningful input for decision
makers. By comparing flood risk before and after an intervention is made, this procedure makes it
possible to evaluate the benefits of flood management investments.

Structural and Nonstructural Measures
There are many ways in which flood risk can be reduced through a proactive approach that
mixes structural and nonstructural measures. Structural and nonstructural measures in flood
management have the objective of bringing flood risk down. The relation illustrated in figure 19 shows
that this can be accomplished by reducing hazard, exposure, and/or vulnerability. Reducing hazard is
primarily possible via structural measures. Modifying exposure and vulnerability is primarily achieved
via nonstructural methods. In recent years the value of nonstructural measures has been increasingly
recognized. Or, using a metaphor: brains are gaining value over muscles.
36   F LO O D R I S K M A N A G E M E N T AT R I V E R B A S I N S C A L E : T H E N E E D TO A D O P T A P R O A C T I V E A P P R O A C H




Historically, structural measures have been used to provide protection against floods and
inundations. For thousands of years, dikes were built in coastal zones and along rivers to defend
against flooding. These works provided protection in a direct way. Later, when the positive effect of
delaying runoff was understood (figure 14), other types of civil engineering works, such as those
designed to increase flood retention capacity, were introduced. As shown in figure 21, there is a
large variety of structural measures to provide protection against floods.

                      •	 Construction of storm surge barriers                                 or dry polders

                      •	 Construction of diversion canals                                  •	 Elevation of terrains in new urban
                                                                                              developments
                      •	 Increase of channel conveyance
                         capacity                                                          •	 Construction of elevated highways

                      •	 Construction of reservoirs                                        •	 Temporary flood defenses



However, some nonstructural measures can also reduce flood hazard if applied over large
areas. These include:

                      •	 Reforestation of the river basin                                  •	 Enhanced infiltration in the river basin
                      •	 Rules for agricultural practices                                  •	 Improved operating rules for
                                                                                              reservoirs


The exposure of an area to floods relates to existing or planned urbanization, economic
activities, and infrastructure. To lessen exposure, decisions can be made to protect existing
settlements or activities and to reduce or cancel future developments. Examples of specific steps for
reducing exposure are given in figure 22.

 BOX 9. Green Infrastructure Solutions: An Exciting Approach To Flood Risk Management

            Hard infrastructure options such as levees and dams have traditionally been the go-to
            solutions in the management of riverine and urban floods. However, the combination of
            increasing flood risk and unevenness in the efficacy and costs of such “gray” infrastructure
 has led to growing interest in other, more integrated approaches. In this regard, green infrastructure
 solutions have become more popular. They leverage natural processes for managing wet-weather
 impacts and reduce the flow of water while also delivering environmental, social, and economic
 benefits. Designed to complement other flood risk management approaches, they connect floodwater
 with adjacent natural storage and overflow systems such as wetlands, mangroves, bioshields, buffer
 zones, and swales. These solutions can be cost-effective, low in impact, and environmentally friendly,
 and can be easily incorporated alongside gray infrastructure or designed as standalones.

 The World Bank’s Urban Floods Community of Practice has recently published a Knowledge Note
 on the role of green infrastructure solutions in flood risk management (UFCOP 2016), which can be
 consulted for more information.


4. FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY
Flood risk assessment is an important component of proactive flood risk management.
In many countries, proactive approaches have led to investments with a very attractive
economic rate of return. Flood risk assessment provides the basis for evaluating the cost-effectiveness
of a range of possible flood management interventions and for prioritizing their realization. It allows
production of risk maps that can be used to compare various investment options with the reference
situation in order to support decision making related to flood risk reduction and land use development.
Due to ongoing land use developments in river basins, flood risk maps have to be updated with a
certain frequency, usually once every 10 to 15 years.
Flood Hazard Mapping
Flood hazard maps are the most important source of information for land development
planning in river basins. As indicated above, flood hazard maps provide spatial information for
selected return periods on flood extent, flood depth, flood duration, and flood flow velocities. With this
information, decision makers can determine whether certain areas are suitable for urban, industrial, or
other developments. The maps also indicate that if developments are deemed advantageous despite
being located in flood-prone areas, special flood protection measures must be taken, which will tend to
increase investment costs. An example of a flood hazard map is shown in figure 23.
Flood hazard maps are produced for selected hazard return periods, e.g., 2, 5, 10, 25, 50,
100, or 500 years. This information provides insight into the damages that may occur at specific
locations and at the stipulated frequencies. If justified by the economic values at stake, a flood risk
map can be produced that provides a more detailed analysis. This need arises in particular for urbanized
areas where the value of economic activities is high.

A Simple Approach to Flood Hazard Mapping: The Gumbel Method
The most straightforward methodology to produce flood hazard maps, often referred as the Gumbel
method, is based upon a frequency analysis applied to discharges at a selected river location. This
method assumes the existence of a single valued relationship between water level and discharge
(rating curve) at that location. Discharges with a selected return period are transformed into water
levels. These levels are then plotted along the transversal section at this location to provide flood
depths on the digital elevation model (discussed in section 5). In the United States, this method
is commonly applied for mapping the 1-in-100-year flood extent in the river floodplain. However, this
method also has quite a number of limitations, as listed in figure 24.

               collected and applied for the
               frequency analysis.


Numerical Simulation Models
In order to address these limitations, it is common practice to supplement this approach
with numerical simulation models for flood mapping. In most cases, this requires a combination
of a rainfall-runoff (or hydrological) model and a hydrodynamic model. These models have to be developed
and calibrated on the basis of surveyed and monitored data. Once a model has been developed it has
to be calibrated and validated by comparing simulated and monitored data, such as water level and/
or discharge time series, flood depth, flood extent maps, etc. Subsequently, model simulations can
be produced by inputting historical data or by using statistically generated data. The application of this
methodology requires more data and other resources than are needed for the simpler Gumbel method.
However, this more resource-intensive approach is highly recommended because it provides more
reliable insights, especially when the simple model is not able to represent the more complex physical
functioning of the system correctly, as is often the case.
There is a large variety of rainfall-runoff model concepts currently in use. For defined areas,
these models describe the water balance by taking into account the fractions of rainfall associated with
losses, such as interception and evapotranspiration, infiltration into the soil, surface storage, and surface
and subsurface runoff to drains. The defined areas could be complete river basins (lumped models) or a
large set of smaller areas, such as subcatchments of the basin or square grid cells (distributed models).
40   F LO O D R I S K M A N A G E M E N T AT R I V E R B A S I N S C A L E : T H E N E E D TO A D O P T A P R O A C T I V E A P P R O A C H




The growing availability of geographic information system (GIS) data (layers)—such as
terrain slopes derived from DEMs, land use, vegetation type, soil type and composition,
drainage networks, etc.—is leading to a growing preference for the development of
distributed models. Data layers in GIS are mapped on each individual cell or subcatchment to derive
local model parameters. The advantage of such models is the more realistic representation of physical
processes, which makes extrapolation to extreme conditions more reliable. This is extremely important
when dealing (for example) with 100-year floods, which are rarely monitored for use in model calibration.

In the distributed approach, model process parameters are related to physical characteristics
derived from GIS layers. These relations are further refined through model calibration, based upon
the availability of reliable monitored rainfall and river discharge data. Once the rainfall-runoff model is
calibrated and validated, its application generates the inflows to a hydrodynamic model, which simulates
the flood wave passage in the network of rivers and canals and across floodplains.

The simplest hydrodynamic models are based upon a 1D schematization of the river network.
These models rely mostly on channel bathymetry in the form of cross-sections and on reservoir and
hydraulic structure information (see section 5 for a discussion of data needs for model development).
They can be set up to represent flow in river networks, open drainage networks, closed drainage
networks, or combinations of these. If only 1D models are used, flood hazard maps are still produced
in GIS by extending computed channel water levels in a transversal direction.

More detailed and correct flood hazard maps are obtained when flow over the terrain is
included in the description by adding a 2D flow component to the model. For this approach, the
results rely mostly on digital terrain elevations. State-of-the-art hydrodynamic modeling uses integrated
1D2D models, which present numerous advantages: they can fully incorporate flow-blocking objects,
such as dikes, highways, and railways; and they can represent a variety of flow-conveying components,
such as canals, culverts, pipes, and tunnels. Simulations made with this type of model make it easier to
detect all kinds of possible flow routes or blockages on the terrain, which may be overlooked in the 1D
approach. Flood maps are also more easily produced by post-processing model results in GIS, allowing
for the determination of flood extent, spatial distribution of flood depth, flow duration, and maximum
flow velocities.

The simple approach presented above considers a local point along the river and the
influence of a single forcing factor only. However, the frequency of peak discharges becomes
more complex when dealing with a variety of tributaries, especially when these arrive from subbasins
with different geological or land use characteristics. The situation becomes even more complex when
impacts from local rainfall, coasts, or large reservoirs are considered. These more complex situations
require the collection of larger quantities of data for the assessment of flood frequencies.

An additional complication is that some of these forcing factors may have a mutually dependent relation,
such as the combination of cyclone-induced storm surges and rainfall. Other combinations are fully
independent, such as rainfall and tides. As suggested above, reservoir operation in particular may be
a complicating factor in flood hazard mapping because reservoirs represent conflicting interests, such
as use for hydropower generation versus use for flood control. Hydropower generation concerns itself
with more than the available stored volume; it is linearly dependent on the water level in the reservoir,
which leads to pressure to maximize reservoir levels, which in turn increases flood hazard.

Flood Risk Mapping
While flood hazard is expressed in terms of the state of the flood situation for a selected
return period, the overall flood risk is computed by integrating the risk over all individual
return periods. For each return period considered, the product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability
has to be computed or estimated. Subsequently, this risk has to be integrated over the various return
periods to arrive at a risk that the area faces as a yearly average. This calculation provides an important
input in determining the yearly budget that can be spent to reduce damage and loss.

Flood risk mapping requires the quantification of exposure in the flood-prone area. First, the
values of assets have to be estimated, often in a clustered manner. In some countries this is done by
linking the asset to the country’s fiscal system database, which is used to impose taxes on properties.
Second, all economic activities in the region have to be evaluated. For industries, this includes not only
damages to assets but the additional losses that occur when production is interrupted—e.g., employees
have to be paid irrespective of production, and clients who face a delay in receiving ordered products
may initiate a claim. An indirect impact of loss of productivity is market losses. All these factors come
into play when dealing with industries.

All other sorts of flood-related losses also have to be investigated. In São Paulo, Brazil, for
example, most of the flood-related losses arise from the interruption of traffic during floods. To reduce
these losses, many flood retention basins have been constructed. However, these investments have
not been able to keep up with the pace of urban densification. A logical step would be to address traffic
congestion in alternative ways, such as the construction of elevated highways, which are quite common
in Asian countries. So far, however, such systematic comparison of possible solutions is still lacking,
and the problems persist.

 BOX 10. Practical Tip for a Flood Risk Manager

                 A proposal for a flood hazard and risk mapping project should clearly
                 describe the methods and products envisaged. What the client needs should
                 become clear from the description given in the terms of reference for the study. A
 good description is even more important when floods are caused by a variety of factors. Although
 some freedom may be given to the consultant for the study, the terms of reference may also
 explicitly prescribe a methodology. In any case, the quality of tools and methodology proposed, in
 combination with available data, determines to a large extent the quality of flood maps delivered.
 The proposed methodology should have significant weight in the assessment of the proposal’s
 overall quality.


Critical Infrastructure

Life in society depends on the functioning of infrastructural facilities, which may be
affected by floods. It is important to guarantee the ability of critical infrastructure to function
during floods. But this does not always happen. During the Bangkok floods of 2011, for example, the
water conveyed through the canal leading to the city water treatment plant got contaminated with
floodwater flowing through the urban environment. The treatment process could not cope with the
huge quantities of pollutants that were introduced, and the quality of water delivered was far below
standards.

More severe was the case in Serbia, where during the 2014 floods electricity production
was severely affected due to the flooding of transformers and equipment. In addition, the
largest open coal mine in Kolubara got flooded up to 60 m in depth with a volume of 210 million m3.
This affected the production of the largest thermoelectric power plant in Serbia, Nikola Tesla, which
had supplied close to 50 percent of electricity in the country. It took 12 months to entirely pump out
water from the coal production fields (Balkan Energy 2016).

As part of flood management in river basins, it is very important to investigate the
safety of critical infrastructure, in particular because damage to one component may affect
other components in a cascade of events. Such risks and relationships may be analyzed in exercises
involving various representative parties and other stakeholders. The outcome of such exercises
is presented in figure 25. The effectiveness of such exercises can be enhanced considerably if
supported with a rapid flood assessment tool, such as 3Di, which generates flood simulation results
in a fast and interactive way.

Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement: “If you can’t measure
something, you can’t understand it, if you can’t understand it, you can’t control it, if you can’t control
it, you can’t improve it.” This remark of H. James Harrington touches the essence of what is required to
control and increase certainty about flood risks. Unfortunately, there are still too many cases in which
the lack of information on flood risks leads to wrong decisions and subsequent large damages. The
rather unpredictable nature of hydrometeorological conditions requires monitoring over long periods to
generate a sense—based on information—of what may happen. Detailed information on extreme flood
conditions is essential for the development of tools that simulate such extreme events. Improvements
in monitoring and surveying have been tremendous over the past decade and have led to insights into
both large trends and details of specific events. A proactive approach in flood management also asks
for a timely decision to collect data on the functioning of the river basin, subject to floods.

Data Needs for Statistical Analyses

Statistical processing of raw data collected for a geographical area can help support a
variety of useful and actionable information. This information can be applied for flood hazard
mapping and help to identify solutions that mitigate the effects of floods. For example, a number of
single-valued statistical parameters are frequently derived for a selected return period, such as peak
river discharge and peak sea water level. A set of parameters derived statistically, such as intensity-
duration-frequency (IDF) curves, is also commonly used to provide (for example) statistically defined
rain storms for urban drainage design.

For statistical analyses, time series data are required over a sufficient period of time,
preferably without interruptions. The duration is related to the return period of the event to
be defined. As a rule of thumb, the duration of the time series has to be at least one-third of the
selected return period for the event.

In river basins, conditions under which data have been collected often evolve. In such
cases, time series data are no longer commensurable, as required for the statistical operations on
the time series. Land use change, such as deforestation and the further use of the land for
agriculture, creates a very different water balance, and the construction of a reservoir may lead
to significant changes in river runoff. Along the river, rating curves change over time due to
morphological impacts. All these factors reduce the reliability of the statistical analysis.

Some areas may be under the influence of periodic climate oscillations, such as El Niño
or La Niña. Moreover, climate change leads to trends that disturb the extrapolation of the series
used to derive state parameters for selected return periods. While climate change in general is a
relatively slow process, urban heat-induced micro-climate change in cities affects convective storms,
which may lead to distinct increasing trends in urban rainfall intensities. Such trends can easily be
misinterpreted as the result of larger-scale climate change.

Despite all these changing conditions, it is useful to collect information on the
hydrometeorological state of a river basin over the longer term. Trends can be identified,
and corrections required in the statistical analyses can be quantified. The identification of trends is
becoming even more valuable in light of discussions on the impact of climate changes on floods.

Data Needs for Model Development

The development of hydrological and hydraulic models requires both spatial
and temporal data. Spatial data requirements include terrain information, such as elevation and
roughness; channel bathymetry; dimensions of hydraulic structures and reservoirs; etc. Models
are constructed based upon these types of data. Time series of rainfall, water levels, and water
discharges are needed for model calibration and validation but also for the simulation of intervention
options. For urban applications the time step in monitoring series must be at least one hour and
preferably more frequent—e.g., for the reproduction of cloudburst events. Whereas statistical
analyses require data covering a long period of time, model calibration and validation are better
served with time series of short duration for extreme conditions, such as extreme rainfall events,
tides, storm surges, etc. Figure 26 includes some specific types and sources of data needed in
model development.

Digital Elevation Models

Most important for the modeling of flood hazards in floodplains and coastal zones are
digital elevation models. In the past, these could be constructed only from topographic maps
with elevation contour lines, often at an interval of one or more meters. For the production of high-
quality flood hazard maps, these 1 m contour lines provide insufficient accuracy in flat areas, such as
floodplains and coastal zones. However, this information can still be useful in serving as a first step
in flood hazard mapping. Such rapid assessment will familiarize relevant agencies with this approach
and will provide insight into the need for more accurate surveying.

In flood hazard mapping, the vertical accuracy determines the quality of the final product.
Horizontal accuracy is of lesser importance, as long as various data sources are consistent in this
respect. A 10 cm vertical accuracy is sufficient for the purpose of flood hazard mapping. Vertical
accuracies of just a few centimeters can be achieved using LiDAR technology. LiDAR data are usually
obtained from airplanes recording via GPS their position relative to satellites and measuring their
distance from the earth’s surface via laser pulses. For the inspection of line elements, such as dikes,
helicopters may also be used effectively. For smaller areas, such as cities, the use of drones is
becoming more common.

The accuracy obtained with LiDAR depends on laser quality and net point density of
laser pulses (flight height and speed), as well as on other flying conditions and vegetation. The
point density also determines whether information on line elements, such as dike crest elevation or
the elevation of concrete or masonry flood protection walls, can be surveyed. The state of the art
is a point density of 8 to 10 points per m2 for planes. With helicopters, a much higher density can
be achieved. Most important is avoiding random errors, which present as errors in the level of one
point relative to other points in the flood hazard mapping domain. System-level errors will not affect
modeled flood flow patterns very much. However, if the reference level of the DEM differs from, for
example, the reference level of water level gauges or cross-section, there is a problem. Consistency
between the LiDAR and the national reference has to be checked, e.g., by using LiDAR boards to
check areas on the terrain for which the position in the national or local reference system is known.
The boards require a size that will receive a sufficient number of pulses to match their coordinates
with the LiDAR reference system.

After quality checking, raw LiDAR data have to be filtered to remove pulses reflected
by vegetation. This process also allows for determining the height and type of vegetation. The
first product obtained from the LiDAR survey is the digital surface model (DSM). After removing
vegetation, buildings and similar structures also have to be filtered out to obtain the digital terrain
model (DTM), which represents the true ground levels and is presented on a grid of polygons. This
could, for example, be a 1 m2 grid covering the flood hazard mapping area.

For the purposes of modeling, this DTM can be processed further to obtain land levels for
the computational grid, i.e., the DEM. Depending on the modeling system used, the grid can
range from a simple 50 m by 50 m square grid to a flexible grid composed of a variety of polygons
of different shapes and sizes. Point cloud data and the DSM and DTM also serve to identify flood
obstacles, such as embankments or other break lines that influence the propagation of floods in the
floodplain. In summary, it is useful to realize that along the path from terrain-level data surveying
to modeling, level data are presented at the following scales: (1) point cloud representation; (2)
surveyed surface data (DSM); (3) processed terrain level data (DTM); and (4) numerical model grid
elevation data (DEM). The DTM or DEM can be further complemented by integrating it with the
bathymetry of rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, lagoons, and other coastal waters. Such integrated
DEMs provide a lot of flexibility in defining hydrodynamic models for flood hazard mapping.

Detailed flood hazard mapping is often preceded by a rapid assessment. A useful basis
for such mapping is the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data model produced by NASA.
Since 2015, terrain-level data have been available at a resolution of 1 arc second (approximately 30
m) for most of the world. The accuracy of the SRTM data set varies spatially. In some areas residual
offsets of levels cause systematic errors. Another source of errors is the presence of vegetation. A
radar pulse used in SRTM reflects a level somewhere along the height of standing vegetation, which
results in SRTM terrain levels higher than in reality. This error requires some form of correction.

Despite these shortcomings, the SRTM-derived DEM can be very useful for a first
analysis of flood hazards. Though the approach certainly does not give perfect results, it is well
to remember the advice given by Voltaire: “Perfect is the enemy of good.” The DEM can be used to
construct a pilot hydrological and hydrodynamic model that gives an indication of flood-prone areas.
For these areas, the quality of the SRTM DEM can be improved by better filtering techniques and
comparison with ground reference points. The pilot model results can also serve to define areas
where LiDAR surveys are recommended to improve the quality of flood hazard maps. The DEM
generated for the LiDAR survey domain can then be complemented with an improved SRTM DEM to
cover the complete flood hazard mapping domain or even the complete river basin. This step requires
the removal of spikes and the impact of vegetation as well as further adjustments to merge the
SRTM DEM seamlessly at the contours of the LiDAR survey domain.

    MANAGEMENT IN RIVER BASINS
     Flood Management Considerations

     1.	   Total protection against flooding in flood-prone areas cannot be guaranteed: this is
           neither possible nor desirable, as the required investments would not be cost-effective.
           Just as people accept other uncertainties in life, such as traffic accidents, they should accept
           that “living with floods” is unavoidable. What is important, though, is that the risk is well
           calculated and accepted on the basis of cost-benefit and socially acceptable principles.
     2.	 River and coastal floodplains are attractive areas for urban, industrial, and
           infrastructural developments. The decision to develop such areas must be based upon
           robust cost-benefit analyses. Essential components in this decision-making process are the
           assessment of flood hazards and flood risks and the identification of measures to minimize
           these risks through structural interventions and nonstructural flood management support. In
           the end, decisions must be based upon achieving higher societal and economic benefits than
           costs, while taking into account future changes such as the impacts of climate change.
     3.	 There is a growing tendency now to adopt a more proactive approach to flood risk
           management, based on worldwide lessons learned from growing losses due to destructive
           floods. The proactive approach to flood management may prevent disasters, while a “wait and
           see” approach could lead to significant numbers of casualties and high economic losses.
     4.	 Investments in structural and nonstructural flood management provide an attractive
           economic rate of return. Investment decisions in flood risk management need to be
           systematically based upon flood hazard mapping and flood risk assessments and the extent
           to which various possible interventions, including structural and nonstructural measures,
           can reduce flood risks. Nonstructural investments include good urban and land use
           planning practices prior to starting the developments, which may prevent or redefine risky
           investments. The higher the level of structural flood protection, the more there is a need for
           complementary nonstructural measures.
     5.	 Information support before and during a flood disaster is an essential component of
           nonstructural flood management. As flood forecasts becoming increasingly accurate,
           they can support planning and in many situations provide sufficient lead time for significant
           potential reductions in flood damages and losses. To complement flood forecasting, there is
           a need for a good information system (dealing with critical infrastructure, evacuation routes,
           shelter, etc.) to enhance preparedness and support early warning during flood emergency
           operations.
     6.	 There is a need for integrated studies in flood risk management. Integrated studies are
           important because flood risk management interventions have impacts outside the areas where

      they are implemented. In river basins, nearly all the interventions that are feasible have positive
      or negative impacts in the downstream direction, and the negative impacts should be included in
      the cost-benefit analysis for the proposed project. Integrated studies are also important because
      flood management interventions generally have impacts on many other aspects of river basin
      management, such as environment, agriculture, drought, hydropower, etc.
7.	   Investing in data collection pays off in the form of more reliable structural and nonstructural
      flood management investments. There is a growing interest in data collection in river basins,
      but much still has to be done in this area. Many flood management studies suffer from a lack of
      data, which can lead to very costly structural failures or wrong decisions in planning. Of particular
      importance are digital terrain models, which provide detailed information on terrain levels to support
      flood hazard mapping based upon numerical simulation modeling.

Implementing Context-Specific Interventions to Manage Flood Risks in River Basins

8.	 Creating flood retention storage in river basins has two important effects: it reduces
      the speed of flood wave propagation, and it reduces flood peak discharges and flood
      peak water levels in the downstream direction. Although in general the impact of such
      interventions is positive, there are exceptions that lead to increased discharge peak values
      downstream, e.g., due to changes in the arrival time of flood peaks from different river
      tributaries.
9.	 Embanking flood-prone areas is often the most cost-effective way to protect
      communities locally. It is nevertheless good practice to study potential negative impacts, as
      such interventions usually increase flood risks downstream. The reduced “room for the river”
      will lead to faster flood propagation downstream and higher peak flows, which may threaten
      downstream embankments or infrastructure such as bridges. It is good practice when
      embanking to implement compensatory measures, such as additional retention capacity
      elsewhere.
10.	 An increase in channel conveyance capacity or channel diversions may decrease
      local flood risks significantly. However, any plans for this type of intervention must take
      downstream impacts into consideration, as the faster release of flood volumes may lead to
      increased flood risk downstream.
11.	 In general, retention space along a river is most effective if installed upstream of an
      area to be protected or at the flooded site. In the first case it lowers peak discharges at
      the flooded site, and in the second case it lowers peak water levels at the flooded site.
12.	 In general, the increase of channel conveyance capacity is most effective if realized at
      an area to be protected or just downstream of it . In the first case it lowers flood levels for
      a given peak flow in the flooded zone, and in the second case it allows flood volume to be
      released faster out of the flooded area.
