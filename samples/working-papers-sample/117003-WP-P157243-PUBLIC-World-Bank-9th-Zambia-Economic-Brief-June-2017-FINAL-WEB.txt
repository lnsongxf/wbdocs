A. REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) picked up in 2017, driven by improved global conditions
and easing domestic constraints. Growth of 2.6% is forecast for the region despite weak prospects
in the three major economies; Nigeria, South Africa and Angola. The region’s growth is projected to
increase further in 2018 (3.2%) and 2019 (3.5%). The outlook is subject to downside risks. Globally,
the risks include tighter than expected global financial conditions, weaker than expected increases in
commodity prices, as well as the threat of protectionism emerging from populist sentiments. Inter-
nally, the risks include possible slippages on reforms, increased security threats, and political uncer-
tainty ahead of elections in some countries.

                                             World Bank’s Africa’s Pulse (released in April 2017) highlights improved global and do-

2017.                                        to 2.7% in 2017. Meanwhile, domestic constraints confronting SSA have been easing,
                                             as the end of the drought has seen agriculture and electricity generation rebounding.

                                             Rebounding global growth has been crucial for the recovery of prices of key export
                                             commodities in SSA (figure 1). Oil prices increased by 7.9% in Q1 2017 relative to the
                                             previous quarter, on the back of steadily increasing demand and agreements by some
                                             OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers to limit output. However, the longer-term recovery
                                             of oil prices is unlikely, given high global oil inventories and an improved supply outlook
                                             in the USA shale oil sector. Metal prices have also strengthened over the same period,
                                             including copper prices (by 10.6%), iron ore prices (22%), and platinum prices (3.9%),
                                             partly reflecting increased demand from China. Despite recent gains, the prices of oil
                                             and metals remain below the levels observed prior to June 2015.
Despite improved
growth, SSA                                  In light of these developments, SSA’s GDP growth is projected to double to 2.6% in

                                              Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa
                                              SSA growth is projected to improve to 2.6% in 2017, slightly below population growth
                                              (2.7%), before increasing further in 2018 (3.2%) and 2019 (3.5%) (figure 4). The outlook
                                              is subject to commodity prices remaining firm, policy actions to tackle large macroeco-

                                   The region grapples with three urgent challenges2. First is a substantial slowdown in
                                   investment growth to 0.6% in 2015 from 8.0% in 2014 – well below the long-term aver-
                                   age of 6.0% (box 1). Second are the high trade logistics costs which are constraining
                                   competitiveness and export diversification. Third are rising public debt levels driven
                                   by large deficits and weak growth. To effectively address these challenges, efforts are
                                   needed to improve institutions for private sector growth, develop local capital markets,
                                   improve the quality and quantity of public infrastructure, enhance the efficiency of utili-
                                   ties, and strengthen domestic resource mobilization.

 Box            Poor infrastructure continues to be a constraint to development in Sub-Saharan Africa
 	              The SSA region lags behind other developing regions in most dimensions of infrastructure perfor-
   1             mance, although trends vary across key sectors. This is especially evident in the electricity and trans-
                 port sectors. Electricity-generating capacity per capita remains low, with only 35% of the population
 having access to electricity. The region also has the lowest road and railroad densities amongst developing
 regions.

 In contrast, telecommunications infrastructure has improved dramatically: the number of fixed and mobile
 phone lines per 1,000 people increased from 3 in 1990 to 736 in 2014, and the number of Internet users per
 100 people increased from 1.3 in 2005 to 16.7 in 2015. Similarly, access to safe water has risen from 51% of
 the population in 1990 to 77% in 2015.

 Closing SSA’s infrastructure quantity and quality gaps can generate large growth gains. Unfortunately, the
 region’s public spending on infrastructure development (2% of GDP) is inadequate for this to be achieved.
 While the private sector can help to bridge the funding deficit, the countries need to build robust institu-
 tional and regulatory frameworks that will attract investment via public-private partnerships (PPPs).

 Moreover, SSA countries need to develop sound public investment management systems to ensure that
 public investments are efficient, and that they can be used to crowd in more private investments via PPPs.
 This entails improving the institutions and procedures governing project appraisal, selection, and monitor-
 ing.

B. THE STATE OF THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY
Zambia has continued its economic recovery in 2017, after a slowdown of growth in 2015 and much
of 2016. Improved copper prices have supported the recovery by lifting the mining sector, while bet-
ter rains over the past two seasons have raised agricultural output and eased electricity outages. Fur-
ther, declining inflation (following a peak above 20% in February 2016) and a stable kwacha have led
the central bank to ease monetary policy, thereby reversing the pressure on credit growth. However,
the improved economic position has not resulted in an improvement in the fiscal indicators. The fis-
cal deficit remains wide and data from Q1 2017 shows revenues below target and expenditure was
not moderated from plans, suggesting that the 7% GDP fiscal target will be hard to achieve. Govern-
ment has started to reduce the large stock of expenditure arrears (its unpaid bills that totaled ZMW
17 billion at the end of 2016), but further efforts are needed to improve budgetary controls and bet-
ter withstand fiscal pressures, if the national debt is to remain at sustainable levels.

                                              prices) and domestic pressures including an El Niño-induced lower harvest in 2015,

                               On the domestic front, a longer and heavier 2016-17 rainy season improved overall
                               crop production and power generation, but temporarily disrupted some economic ac-
                               tivity in early 2017 (for example in the construction and mining sectors). Despite an out-
                               break of maize-pest armyworms (which was contained in February 2017), the real value
                               of crops produced expanded by 19.1% in the 2016-17 season, following a contraction
                               of 1.1% in the previous season. The production of key crops increased, including maize
                               (by 25%), rice (44.1%), soybeans (31.4%), burley tobacco (30%), groundnuts (28.2%),
                               sorghum (22.9%), wheat (21.4%) and millet (8.7%).4 Given that crop production contrib-
                               utes over 87% to the output of the agriculture sector, these crop production gains are
                               expected to lift the growth of the sector in 2017.

                               Higher rains have led to the faster replenishment of hydro-electricity reservoirs in 2017
                               than in 2016. As at end-May 2017, Lake Kariba’s water level (Zambia’s largest hydro-
                               electricity reservoir) had reached 55% of full capacity, compared to 32% at the same
                               point in 2016. Electricity generation grew by 17.5% in Q4 2016 and a further 9.4% in
                               Q1 2017, largely due to increased production from the hydroelectric units. Improved
                               power generation is expected to stimulate economy-wide growth, reversing the impact
                               of two years of persistent power outages5.

                               Meanwhile, improved macroeconomic stability (chiefly a more stable exchange rate
                               and single-digit inflation), the subsequent loosening of monetary policy, and a gradual
                               clearance of Government expenditure and VAT arrears have improved conditions for
                               the economic recovery, especially for firms in services and construction sectors.

                               Aggregate banking sector liquidity expanded for the first five months of 2017, following
                               a year of contraction.6 However, average lending rates have declined only marginally

                                  agriculture subsidies and election expenditures. The 2016 fiscal deficit (on cash basis)
                                  reached 5.7% of GDP, above the approved target of 3.8%, while the underlying deficit

                                  of enhancing competition to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of supply.

                                  • Reduction in electricity subsidies: The Energy Regulation Board (ERB) approved
                                  increases in the electricity tariffs for non-mining consumers of 50% in May 2017, and
                                  an additional 25% in September 2017. Meanwhile, the government has commissioned
                                  a study on the cost of electricity supply, with the results expected at the end of 2017,
                                  to guide future prices changes. The government has also been renegotiating electricity

                                  Debt levels have remained elevated, due to large and repeat fiscal deficits between
                                  2012 and 2016 (figure 8), and huge external borrowing followed by a currency shock
                                  in 2015. Fiscal deficits have been financed by new non-concessional sources, includ-

                                             servicing debt now amounts to 20% of domestic revenue in 2017 from just 8% in 2012.
                                             This leaves less resources for development priorities and poverty reduction.

C. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, RISKS AND POLICY CHALLENGES
We project GDP growth to strengthen to 4.1% in 2017, and further to 4.5% in 2018 and 4.7% in 2019.
For 2017, the forecast assumes the government will continue to implement its economic recovery
plan, the harvest and electricity production will be stronger because of the favorable weather, and
copper production will increase because of the new and recently refurbished mines. We also assume
that gradual fiscal consolidation and sustained efforts on structural reforms, along with a sustained
decline in inflation, will allow for easier monetary policy. Efforts are needed to ensure that growth is
not just faster, but more inclusive. As the government implements its Economic Recovery Plan, fiscal
consolidation will be critical to containing the accumulation of arrears, reducing pressure on mon-
etary policy and cementing resurging investor confidence.

                                                 prices during the rest of the year. This is consistent with World Bank forecasts that sug-

                                                 the World Bank and the African Development Bank over the medium-term.
                                            iii. The improvements to the electricity supply are maintained and there is no return to

D. PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CHOICES MATTER

Zambia has successfully increased its production of crops (largely maize), although this had been
driven by increasing the cultivation of land as opposed to large steps forward in terms of yields. This
leaves enormous scope to increase agriculture productivity and to reduce the vulnerability associ-
ated with a high level of dependence on rain-fed agriculture. While the total amount of agriculture
expenditure has been increased over the past 15 years, there is vast scope to improve both its ef-
ficiency and effectiveness. The agriculture budget is unbalanced as it is dominated by the Farmers
Input Support Program (FISP) and the Food Reserve Agency (FRA). Shortcomings in the budgeting
process also reduce spending effectiveness.


                                             Agriculture is more than just a sector in Zambia. It is a livelihood for the majority of
                                             households, employs 48% of the working population and remains a key priority for en-

                                             contribute to a broader dialogue on agricultural policy in Zambia.

                                             and job creation efforts.

                                             Zambia increased its agriculture spending from below 2% of the budget in the early
                                             2000s to 10% in 2010-11, and it has fluctuated between 5.4% and 10% since (figure 12).
                                             Public expenditure on agriculture in Zambia is considered as spending on agriculture,
                                             livestock and fisheries. At present, there is a Ministry of Agriculture and a Ministry of
                                             Fisheries and Livestock, each with a separate administration budget.27

                                  Evidence suggests that in Zambia, the value-added segment of the agriculture sector is
                                  lower than in many other countries28, suggesting that there is now a pressing need to

                                  offers maize price support and helps ensure food security. Between 2008 and 2016,
                                  they utilized, on average, 79% of spending in the sector (figure 13). This has crowded

                                  and the introduction and diffusion of new technologies that are important drivers of
                                  robust agricultural productivity growth. Both of these programs also suffer from being
                                  loaded with multiple objectives beyond their core mandate, and actions in pursuit of
                                  one objective can reduce progress with other objectives.

                                             Despite their widespread use, the returns to the subsidy programs have been shown
                                             to be low and variable. Evidence has recently been accumulating on some of the largest

                                             Zambia—based on farm-level surveys. In Zambia, there have been many studies that
                                             point to shortcomings in the delivery of the FISP30. The studies point to several conclu-

                                   Improving the delivery of FISP
                                   The traditional FISP is beset with challenges and is viewed as failing in its main objectives
                                   of increasing productivity and poverty reduction31. It has been in operation since 2002
                                   and has been associated with a long-running discussion on how it might be improved.
                                   A much discussed reform idea has been the use of an electronic voucher (e-FISP).

                                   Zambia piloted the e-FISP in 13 districts during the 2015-16 season and 39 districts
                                   during the 2016-17 season (box 2). The e-FISP provides farmers with a debit card, with

  Box       The Electronic Voucher FISP
  	2        The e-FISP has the following objectives:
            • Reduce public expenditure on the delivery of inputs;
  • Crowd in more private sector participation in agro-input distribution, thereby promoting competitiveness
       and transparency in the supply and distribution of inputs;
  • Ensure timely delivery and access to inputs by smallholder farmers;
  • Provide farmers with the freedom to choose inputs of their choice, thereby promoting agricultural
       diversification and;
  •   Reduce the misappropriation of funds and increase the number of intended beneficiaries by linking the
       e-cards to a particular farmer and their National Registration Card.

  The pilot is associated with the following achievements when compared to the standard FISP:
  • A comparison of implementation costs between the e-voucher and the conventional FISP showed that
        the government could make a significant amount of savings by implementing FISP through the e-voucher,
        as there are no procurement, transportation, storage, and handling costs involved.
  •    Participation by the private sector in input distribution to rural farmers increased by 83%, from 230 agro-
       dealers during the 2015/16 farming season to 422 during the 2016/17 season.
  •    Although farmers were still biased towards redeeming fertilizer and maize seed, the system encouraged
       agricultural diversification. For instance, in the livestock rich areas such as Southern Province, about 10%
       of the households reported purchasing veterinary drugs and dip chemicals, and another 5.5% redeemed
        their vouchers for insecticides and herbicides.

  However, the pilot also faced challenges. Delays in launching the program for the 2016/17 season due to
  late government funding had some significant consequences, such as the e-cards being distributed late
  (towards the end of December 2016). This meant that farmers were unable to redeem inputs ahead of the
  growing season.

                                             target reserve size (currently 500,000 tons) the FRA would allow space for the increased

                                             how much maize it is buying nation-wide. A functioning monitoring system would need

E. RE-FOCUS SPENDING TO MORE PRODUCTIVE INTERVENTIONS

There remains a need to reform the FISP and the FRA program that dominate expenditure in the sector, and
to free-up resources for high-return categories of spending (such as extension, R&D, irrigation, sanitary and
phytosanitary systems, market information systems and marketing infrastructure). These are currently under-
funded, as are complementary investments and interventions to address the impacts of climate change better
so that production gains are not eroded.

                                             High-return categories of spending are underfunded
                                             Investments in rural public goods, combined with better policies and institutions, have

                                             Some categories of spending that have been shown to have significant positive effects
                                             on productivity and welfare include: extension; R&D (box 3); irrigation; sanitary and phy-

                                             areas are frequently underfunded due to technical and political economy reasons.

                                             Improving the efficiency of public spending requires managing the political pressures
                                             that determine budget allocations. Groups of producers that control a large proportion
                                             of national wealth often have the means to influence public policies to their benefit.
                                             Political pressures and donor approaches sometimes influence spending toward short

  Box    Agriculture research has high returns but is severely underfunded
     3   Spending on agricultural R&D is worth an especially close look, given the strong evidence that returns to
  investments in this area are consistently high around the world. A large sample of studies estimated rates of re-
  turn averaging 43% in developing countries and 34% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, agricultural R&D capacity in SSA
  has remained low by international norms. Over the last decade, spending on agricultural research constituted
  about 0.4% of agricultural GDP in SSA, compared with 1.3% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 0.6% in East Asia
  and the Pacific, and 0.9% in South Asia (figure 0.7). In addition, Africa was the only region where agricultural re-
  search spending fell on average over this period. These are troubling signs that agricultural research is severely
  underfunded in Africa.

F. SUMMARY OF IDEAS FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURE INVESTMENT
What expenditure choices are required to improve the return on investment in agriculture? This is
an important question, but there is also a need to think hard about why reforms, discussed for many
years (for example the e-voucher), have been so sluggish. How can political support be marshalled
for reform and more effective spending? Efforts and innovation are needed to overcome inertia in
policy making and move beyond the status quo.

                                             The above analysis and following ideas are focused on agriculture public spending and
                                             investment. There are much broader discussions on agriculture reform, to which it is
                                             hoped that these ideas will contribute.
As savings
are realized,                                i. Streamline and better target agriculture subsidies: There are four key steps
they should be                               within the FISP to achieve this. First, the roll-out of the e-voucher to all districts has

agriculture sector.
                                             The 2017 budget promised a full roll-out for the 2017-18 season, but this―based on
                                             current delivery challenges―appears to be too ambitious. Instead, a realistic timeline
                                             for 2017-19 should be drawn up. Second, the targeting of the program37 should be en-
                                             hanced to make it more efficient and to reduce the overall cost (freeing up resources
                                             for complementary agriculture expenditures). Linking the electronic card to National
                                             Registration Cards will be a key step. Third, there is need for a clear exit strategy―
                                             farmers should not receive subsides indefinitely―as the program should sustainably
                                             raise productivity and incomes so that the farmer can buy inputs and graduate from
                                             the subsidy program. Finally, there is a need to ensure that farmers can, in practice,
                                             select the inputs they would like to use and the crops they grow. This is a crucial step
                                             for reversing the maize-centric status of Zambian agriculture. To improve the FRA,
                                             efforts are needed to ensure the prescribed purchase limit is not exceeded. A moni-

                                             iii. Address the impacts of climate change: Climate-smart agriculture, particularly
                                             conservation agriculture, can increase the agricultural productivity of farmers, thus con-

                                             and these avenues should be explored.
