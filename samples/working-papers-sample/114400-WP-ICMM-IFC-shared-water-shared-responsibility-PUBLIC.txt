Access to water remains one of the biggest global challenges of the 21st
Century. Growing population, water consumption, pollution, and climate       thinking mare

solutions that contribute to improved water security and sanitation for all.
Mining companies are increasingly thinking more collaboratively-with local
communities, government and other industries-about shared water use.
Meaningful partnerships have already resulted in improved infrastructure, better
water management throughout and beyond the catchment area, and increased
cooperation among water users. But much more can be done.
IFC and CMM have a common goal of improving mining's contribution to
sustainable development. We believe that the industry can be a partner for
development and this paper aims to support thatjourney through a focus on
water: sharing the practical challenges, successes and lessons learnt from those
companies and local partners who have worked across boundaries to tackle
shared water risks and seize shared opportunities.
Only through collaboration will we be able to realize a socially equitable,
environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial water future
for everyone.

Anatomy of a collaborative effort:
the South Gobi experience
For centuries, the nomadic people of Mongolia's semi-arid South Gobi region have
survived by relying on their deep, traditional knowledge of animal husbandry and
complex understanding of their natural habitat. They tend their flocks, following the
herds to feeding grounds and watering holes. But water has always been a challenge in
a region that typically sees less than 50 millimeters of precipitation each year.
In recent years, the situation seems to
have gotten worse. Herders'traditional
watering holes have started to run dry.
By some estimates, nearly 70 percent
of the pastureland has stopped
blooming and become more desert-
like due to overgrazing.9 Livestock
numbers have risen dramatically since
the break-up of the Soviet Union in
the early 1990s, when collectivized
herding practices were abandoned.
Herders have also become much more
vulnerable to the impacts of extreme
weather events, known as dzuds.
More than 20 million head of livestock
were lost in the mortality events of
2000-2002 and 2009-2010.10

Collaboration across the globe
In this section, mining companies engaged in
collaborative action at sites around the world
share their experiences.


﻿ii


﻿Shared water, shared responsibility, shared approach                       29
The companies that shared their experiences all
confirm that there is no single answer to highly
complex water problems faced by mining companies
and the communities where they operate. Much
depends on the unique set of circumstances individual
companies face: local operating conditions; varying
political landscapes; business, environmental and
social risks. Developing a thorough understanding
of the interplay of catchment dynamics beyond the
mine fence is a critical first step towards addressing
complex water challenges. But turning these
challenges into opportunities and tangible shared
benefits for water users takes creative problem
solving, true collaboration, and leadership.
This chapter highlights some key lessons for mining
companies that are embarking on a collaborative water
effort. They are illustrated with examples and case
studies provided by colleagues and peers who have
pioneered such collaborative approaches to water
challenges.

Concluding thoughts
While collaboration is by no means a new thing, it is
still not the widely accepted practice among all mining
companies. In fact, mining companies fall along a broad
spectrum here-from insistence on privacy and going
it alone through to open and transparent engagement
with other competitors, industry users, and community
stakeholders.
