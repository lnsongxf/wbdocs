 Partnering with Civil Society
 In 2016, the Bank partnered with the World
 Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to pilot the
 PROFOR Forest Governance Assessment
 in Zambezia and Cabo Delgado. Bringing
 together government, private sector, universities
 and CSOs, the assessment highlighted
 governance challenges and suggested
 improvements to be supported under MozFIP.

 Engaging Universities
 “With financial and technical support from the
 Bank, Zambezia’s local university UNIZAMBEZE
 organized the first Mozambican Scientific
 Conference on Agroforestry Systems in October
 2016. We managed to bring together over 200
 researchers, students, politicians, civil society
 and private sector representatives to discuss
 scientific topics, from crop production and
 productivity, to conservation and climate change.”

     Challenges
     Although the ILFM Portfolio has made great
     progress and seen many successes in
     strengthening Mozambique’s landscape and
     forest management, it has not been without
     its set backs. Through the implementation of
     the Portfolio’s work and activities, the Bank is
     actively addressing the following challenges:


     Stakeholder engagement and participatory
     reform:
     The Government needs to tread carefully when
     advancing politically sensitive agendas such
     as reforms in forest governance, addressing
     deeply entrenched issues of wildlife poaching,
     changes in land use planning, and the use
     of commercial reforestation. The Bank is
     helping ensure activities are inclusive of all
     stakeholders by assisting the Government with
     stakeholder consultations (with an emphasis
     on community consultations), facilitating buy-
     in schemes, and ensuring the development of
     reforms and activities are done peacefully and
     effectively in a participatory manner.

                                       Moving Forward



Technical and management capacity at a
national and local scale:

The Government’s management and technical
capacity has not increased at the same rate as
the introduction of new funds and tools. Ongoing
technical gaps and management capacity can lead
to implementation delays in the short term. The
Bank is addressing these challenges through its
complementary technical assistance and support
to Government entities and other key stakeholders.
Working with limited financial resources:
Mozambique’s current fiscal environment and limited
financial resources poses sustainability issues and
strong dependence on donors. This is exacerbated
by the limited revenue currently generated by natural
resources. However, it is hoped that revenue in
areas such as nature-based tourism, private sector
cooperation, and sustainable forest management
will increase in the future.

Capturing lessons learned:

Risks are inevitable with innovative implementation
models such as those used in the ILFM
Portfolio, making it critical to closely monitor
implementation and interim results so investments
can be adjusted as needed. To learn from past
experiences and strengthen the implementation
of future investments, the Bank is working
to improve the collection of data and build
monitoring capacity in the forest and landscape
sector to ensure the continual capturing of
“lessons learned”.
