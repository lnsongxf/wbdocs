                                                      LAO PDR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROJECT

                                        SNAPSHOT THREE: CHILD DEVELOPMENT


This snapshot summarizes preliminary findings related to child development from the Early Childhood
Education (ECE) Study in Lao PDR. The ECE Study was initiated to evaluate the Early Childhood Education
Project. The results presented here represent data collected on the status of child development prior to
the implementation of the project. Data will be collected again after the project has finished to see if the
project has improved outcomes for children. This snapshot highlights that children in Northern Lao PDR
are developing poorly, with disparities in child development across different ethnic groups and family
backgrounds. In particular, Lao-Tai children are developing better than Khmun and Hmong children, and
children of parents with some education are doing better than children of parents with no education.
Results also reflect very low rates of parent-child interaction and opportunities for children to learn, and
this appears to be having a negative impact on child development.

Early childhood development is generally defined as
the holistic development of children from conception.
Development is the result of the process of change in
which the child comes to master increasingly complex
levels of moving, thinking, feeling and interacting with
people and objects in his/her environment. There are
various aspects of development, such as physical, social
and emotional, language and cognitive development.
Early childhood development is considered to be the
most important phase in life, which determines later
health, wellbeing, learning, behavior and achievements
across the life course. It is a time of both opportunity
and vulnerability and each child’s development
is dependent on a combination of biological and
environmental factors.

Especially important for healthy development is the
stimulation, support and nurturing a child experiences
in his/her family and care environments. When children
do not have adequate opportunities to play and learn,
they are unable to develop to their full potential.
