1 Introduction

Land area is a fundamental input into statistical and economic analyses linked to agriculture, inequality
and land registration, titling and redistribution programs. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
Targets 2.3 and 2.4 require doubling of agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food
producers, and ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural
practices that increase productivity and production, respectively. Both targets are associated with
indicators2 that rely on land area information sourced from household or farm surveys, and research has
demonstrated the importance of accurate land area measurement for accurate measurement and
analysis of land productivity (Carletto, et al., 2013) (Carletto, et al., 2015).

While data collection on smallholder production systems has traditionally relied on self-reported land
areas, this is problematic, particularly in the African context, which is characterized by the high incidence
of smallholder farming and the fragmentation of farms into multiple parcels with irregular shapes and
without formal titles. Several reasons may contribute to the inaccuracy in self-reported land areas. First,
farmers may knowingly overstate or understate their landholdings for strategic reasons that may relate
to access to development programs and/or taxation. Second, there is a natural tendency to round off
numbers and provide approximations, which leads to heaping of the data around discrete values. Third,
geography, particularly slope, can influence the way farmers assess distance and area. Fourth, the use of
non-standard measurement units and within-country variation in the type and standard unit equivalence
of these units complicate the compilation of conversion factors for land area measurement. Fifth, the
magnitude and direction of the measurement error in self-reported land areas have been shown
repeatedly to be systematically associated with observable plot, household and respondent attributes.

These reasons, combined with (i) the validated accuracy of GPS-based land area measurement in
household survey experiments in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania (Zanzibar) (Carletto, et al., 2016), and (ii)
the ever-increasing affordability and accuracy of handheld GPS devices makes GPS-based land area
measurement a desirable alternative for household and farm surveys in countries dominated by
smallholder agricultural production. However, with the emergence of GPS-based area measurement as
the new, scalable gold-standard for household and farm surveys, a key drawback is related to the
operationalization of the technology. To reduce transportation costs, keep household interview durations
within reasonable limits, and avoid the difficulty of asking respondents to accompany enumerators to
agricultural plots that are situated far from dwelling locations, survey implementing agencies often
require enumerators to only obtain GPS-based area measures for plots within a given radius of dwelling
locations. Thus, non-ignorable shares of area measures are missing in public use data sets. For instance,
among the selected national, multi-topic panel household surveys that are supported by the World Bank
Living Standards Measurement Study – Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) program, the rate of
missingness in GPS-based plot areas ranges from 13 (Nigeria) to 44 percent (Uganda), as presented in

Table 1. The missing data, in turn, may limit the operational relevance and the analytical value of GPS-
based area measurement, given the potential biases introduced by missingness.

Recognizing the need to address the problem of missing data for increasing the usability of household
survey data, (Kilic, et al., 2017) use LSMS-ISA data from Tanzania and Uganda to show that the missing
GPS-based plot areas constitute a non-random subset of the unit-record data, but that the missing data
can be simulated by Multiple Imputation (MI). In their analysis of plot-level agricultural productivity, the
authors document the non-trivial effects of using the completed data sets following MI.

Given the potential of MI for imputing the missing GPS-based land areas and the importance of rigorously
addressing missingness for productivity estimation, this paper takes on the challenging task of
determining thresholds for acceptable rates of item non-response in plot areas in large-scale surveys that
adopt GPS technology for land area measurement. To do so, we work with national household survey data
from Malawi and Ethiopia that exhibit near-negligible rates of missingness in GPS-based plot areas, and
use these data sets as validation samples to gauge the accuracy of an MI application to predict missing
GPS-based land areas.

The use of actual data collected as part of large-scale household surveys that had adopted GPS-based area
measurement is key to the operational relevance of our research. We set up our empirical framework as
to identify the limits to simulation accuracy and provide recommendations for capturing the minimum set
of required data for robust statistical analyses relying on plot areas. Specifically, in both data sets, we

  i.    create artificial missingness in GPS-based plot areas at random at a rate of 1 to 100 percent, at an
        increment of 1 percent, among plots that are above two distance thresholds, namely a distance
        of greater than 500 meters or 1 kilometer from the dwelling unit,
  ii.   construct an imputation model for missing GPS-based plot areas following (Kilic, et al., 2017),
 iii.   conduct MI based on each unique data set under a specific simulated degree of missing
        observations beyond the two different distance thresholds,
 iv.    compare the distributions of two outcomes, namely plot area and plot-level agricultural
        productivity, based on the imputed GPS-based plot areas with the distributions of the same
        variables based on the observed area measures for the same plots, and lastly
  v.    identify the missingness threshold beyond which MI yields at least 1 imputed distribution out of
        a total of 50 imputations that is statistically different from the observed distribution at the 5
        percent level.

The headline finding is that in Malawi, MI can produce imputed yields that are statistically
undistinguishable from the true distributions with up to 82 percent missingness in plot areas that are
further than 1 kilometer with respect to the dwelling location. The comparable figure in Ethiopia is 56
percent. These rates correspond to overall rates of missingness of 23 percent in Malawi and 13 percent in
Ethiopia. If one sets the distance threshold at 500 meters, the imputed yields are statistically
undistinguishable from the true distributions with distant plot missingness up to 45 percent in Malawi and

36 percent in Ethiopia, translating, respectively, into overall tolerable missingness rates of 21 percent and
15 percent.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents the empirical approach.
Section 4 discussed the results. Section 5 concludes.


2 Data

The microdata informing our analyses originate from the Malawi Third Integrated Household Survey
2010/2011 (IHS3) and the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey Wave II 2013/2014 (ESS2), which were
conducted, respectively, by the Malawi National Statistical Office (NSO) and the Central Statistics Agency
(CSA) of Ethiopia, under the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study – Integrated Surveys on
Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) program.3

The IHS3 data were collected within a two-stage cluster sampling design, and are representative at the
national, urban/rural, regional, and district levels, covering 12,271 households in 768 enumeration areas
(EAs). ESS2 is part of a long-term project to collect panel data. It covered all regional states including the
capital, Addis Ababa. Much of the sample is comprised of rural areas as it was carried over from ESS1. The
survey is representative at the national, urban/rural and, 6 strata (4 regions plus Addis Ababa and the
other regions) covering 5,262 households in 433 EAs.

In terms of questionnaire instruments, the IHS3 and the ESS2 both had Household, Agriculture, and
Community Questionnaires. In each setting, the sample households were administered a multi-topic
Household Questionnaire that collected individual-disaggregated information on demographics,
education, health, wage employment, nonfarm enterprises, anthropometrics, and control of income from
non-farm income sources, as well as data on housing, food consumption, food and non-food expenditures,
food security, and durable and agricultural asset ownership, among other topics. In addition, agricultural
households received the Agriculture Questionnaire, which solicited information on land areas,
manager/holder identification, physical characteristics, labor and non-labor input use, and crop
cultivation and production at the plot-level.

Further, it is important to note that the IHS3 and the ESS2 make a clear distinction between a parcel and
a plot. A parcel is conceptualized as a continuous piece of land under a common tenure system, while a
plot is defined as a continuous piece of land on which a unique crop or a mixture of crops is grown, under
a uniform, consistent crop management system, not split by a path of more than one meter in width, and
with boundaries defined in accordance with the crops grown and the operator. Therefore, a parcel can be
made up of one or more plots. This distinction is key since for the purposes of within-farm analysis of

                                                                                                                 4
agricultural productivity, the ideal is to capture within-parcel, plot area measurements linked with plot-
level measurement of agricultural production.4 Further, agricultural production data were collected for
the two main agricultural seasons in each survey. Handheld global positioning system (GPS)-based
locations and land areas of the plots were recorded, permitting us to link household- and plot-level data
to outside geographic information system (GIS) databases.

The IHS3 required GPS-based area measurement of all plots that are owned and/or cultivated by the
sampled households, within 2 hours of travel with respect to the household location, regardless of mode
of transportation. For the distant plots, the field teams were advised to cluster them in accordance with
their location, and to visit them in a coordinated fashion by using the team vehicle. For the sub-sample of
IHS3 households that were visited twice, the first visit data were also reviewed, and the missing GPS-based
plot areas were fed forward to the second visit interviews for potential capture by the field teams. While
the first visit constraints leading to missing data still applied to most of these households during the
second visit, the continuing emphasis on increasing the volume of GPS-based plot area measures did result
in additional data capture. On the other hand, the ESS2 instructed the enumerators to take GPS-based
area measures of all plots that are owned and/or cultivated by the sampled households, irrespective of
distance. For plots less than 40 square meters, the enumerators measured areas by traversing, instead of
GPS units. The overall rates of missingness in GPS-based plot areas were considerably low in both settings:
3.8 percent in Malawi and 6.2 percent in Ethiopia. These are in fact the lowest levels observed among the
surveys supported by the LSMS-ISA program.

Our analysis assumes both data sets to be complete and representative of the true distributions of
interest, and is subsequently conducted using plots for which GPS based-land area measurements are
available.5 Table 2 shows the distribution of plots according to their distance from the dwelling for both
data sets. Table 3 presents the summary statistics based on the IHS3 and the ESS2, including the plot-level
means for the entire sample; for the sample within 1 kilometer of the dwelling; and for the sample that
lie outside of the 1 kilometer radius of the dwelling. Table 4 accomplishes the same objective but for the

  Parcel-level GPS-based area estimation could serve other objectives, such as surveying of land for land registration
or titling programs or for land ownership measurement. An open empirical question is whether the extent to which
parcel-area measurement could be reliably backed from aggregation of within-parcel, plot area measures – an
exercise that will be mediated by the precision with which parcel and plot boundaries are established in the field
prior to GPS-based area measurement.
5
  We cannot work with approximately 50 percent of the ESS2 plots in the public use data since the CSA ancillary data
set with the conversion factors for the non-standard land area measurement units (to express farmer-reported plot
areas in hectares) does not include conversion factors for all non-standard measurement units. This limitation
further underscores the importance using GPS-based land area measurements. Going forward, the ESS2 can be used
to update the referenced ancillary data set of conversion factors. Prior to the validation exercise, we elected not to
update the ancillary data set using the ESS2 since the imputation model performance would have improved
dramatically in a mechanical manner. Further, the overwhelming majority of the predictors that we use in the
validation exercise based on the ESS2 data do present statistically significant differences across the plots depending
on whether land area conversion factor is available. These predictors are included in the imputation model, and to
the extent that they are correlated with observed and unobserved attributes that predict the likelihood of a farmer-
reported plot area with a missing conversion factors, the ESS2 sample that we end up focusing on should be deemed
satisfactory for validation purposes.

                                                                                                                    5
samples split by the alternative, 500-meter, distance threshold. We provide the differences between the
sample means, and note when a given mean difference is statistically significant.

Several noteworthy findings emerge from Tables 2, 3 and 4. First, the distribution of plots per distance
threshold is quite similar across the two countries. Between 54 and 60 percent of the plots are within 500
meters and between 72 to 77 percent are within 1.0 km. Second, the plots within the distance threshold
tend to be of significantly smaller areas than the plots beyond that threshold. Third, several important
plot and household level characteristics which are expected to be associated with productivity related
outcomes, display statistically significant differences by distance threshold status. As also noted by (Kilic,
et al., 2017), these observations highlight the importance of systematically addressing missingness in GPS-
based plot areas, if such GPS data are to be used in a robust fashion.


3 Empirical Approach

3.1 Artificial Missingness Creation

The first step in our analysis is to generate missing GPS-based plot areas in a way that would be similar to
real-life field experience. Missing GPS-based plot areas measurements are often tied to numerous field
logistics and cost constraints. However, the variable that underlies the lion share of missing GPS-based
plot areas in household survey operations is the plot distance from the dwelling or the location with
respect to the EA boundaries. As noted above, the IHS3 instructed the enumerators to measure all plots
within 2 hours travel time from the dwelling locations, while the ESS2 required the measurement of all
plots, with the exception of those less than 40 square meters, irrespective of distance/travel time. For a
more time and/or budget constrained operation, a lower threshold for GPS based land areas
measurements could be enforced.

Our study uses 500 meters and 1 kilometer as the distance thresholds beyond which 1 to 100 percent of
GPS-based plot area observations are artificially and randomly tagged to be missing in an increment of 1
percentage point. The distance variable underlying the thresholds is the Euclidean (crow-fly) distance
between the geo-referenced plot and dwelling location.6 To get sense of the time requirements associated
with visiting plot locations that are below versus above the chosen distance thresholds, consider, for
instance, the walking time associated with the inclination-adjusted minimum cost distance between
dwelling and plot locations in Malawi. For plots that are within the 500 meters and within the 1 kilometer
threshold, the average walking times are 4 minutes and 6 minutes, respectively. Conversely, for plots that
are outside the 500 meters and outside the 1 kilometer threshold, the average walking times are 33
minutes and 47 minutes, respectively.

6
  Other geospatial measures of the plot distance to the dwelling were considered, including the estimated minimum
cost distance that considers topography; the walking time associated with the minimum cost distance; and the
inclination-adjusted measures of these two variables. The weighted pairwise correlation between any of the
alternatives and our Euclidean distance measure is above 99 percent, and our results are robust to the use of these
alternative distance measures.

                                                                                                                 6
3.2 Multiple Imputation

The second step of our approach is to use Multiple Imputation (MI) to fill the gaps that we artificially
create in the GPS-based plot area measures. MI, first proposed by (Rubin, 1987), is a Monte Carlo
technique that replaces missing values for a given variable with m > 1 simulated alternatives. MI typically
consists of three steps: (i) m imputations (i.e. m complete data sets) are generated based on an imputation
model that encompasses a vector of observable covariates that predict the missingness in a given variable,
(ii) statistical analysis is performed separately with each of the m complete data sets, and (iii) the results
obtained from m complete data analyses are combined into a single set of multiply-imputed parameter
estimates and standard errors.

The conditions under which valid inferences could be obtained from missing data are laid out in Rubin's
(1987) seminal work on MI. The procedure assumes that data are missing at random (MAR) and that
missing data could be predicted based on observable attributes underlying missingness. While the MAR
assumption is not empirically testable, the limits of its tenability could be assessed in our study.

In building the imputation model, the literature (Rubin, 1996) or (van Buuren, et al., 1999) advises to
include as explanatory variables: (i) the variables appearing in the analysis model that features the
multiply-imputed variable(s), (ii) the variables that are known to have influenced the occurrence of
missing data, and other variables for which the distributions differ between the response and non-
response groups, (iii) the variables that explain a considerable amount of variance of the multiply-imputed
variable(s) and that help to reduce the uncertainty of the imputations, and (iv) the variables with
information on the features of the complex survey design, including stratum and cluster identifiers, and
sampling weights.

In their MI application to missingness in GPS-based land areas in Tanzania and Uganda, (Kilic, et al., 2017)
attempt to provide support for the MAR assumption by (i) detailing the field work processes underlying
the missing data, (ii) providing insights from their field experience and interactions with the survey teams,
(iii) systematically documenting the established guidelines on imputation model specification, and (iv)
including in the imputation model explanatory variables that influence the occurrence of missing data;
that have different distributions between the response and non-response groups; that explain a
considerable amount of variance of the multiply-imputed variable; and that include information on the
survey design. Our approach to specifying the imputation model mirrors that of (Kilic, et al., 2017). A key
covariate that is included in the imputation model and that is both a powerful predictor and an alternative
measure of the GPS-based plot area is the farmer-reported plot area. The availability of this variable
distinguishes our study as well as (Kilic, et al., 2017) from other studies that have employed MI to tackle
item non-response.

For illustration, Table 5 and Table 6 show the details of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) imputation model
for Malawi and Ethiopia, respectively. In addition to farmer-reported plot area, we include plot manager,
household and other plots attributes as predictors. The model specification differs slightly between the


                                                                                                            7
IHS3 and the ESS2 depending of the availability of the variables or the specificity of the data set. For
example, the raw data on farmer-reported plot areas could have been expressed in non-standard
measurement units in the ESS2, as such we add dummy variables for these units in the imputation model
for Ethiopia.

We estimate the imputation model using each data set that is created by a given distance threshold-
artificial missingness combination. While the results confirm that the predictions are essentially driven by
the farmer-reported plot area, the more comprehensive model improves the accuracy and precision of
our predictions. As pointed out by (Kilic, et al., 2017), it is worth emphasizing that the imputation model
neither intends to provide a parsimonious description of the data nor attempts to portray structural
relationships among variables. Instead, it attempts to be as comprehensive as possible to minimize any
bias that could stem from omitting variables that might be relevant to the pattern of missingness or the
subsequent analysis. “The possible lost precision when including unimportant predictors is usually viewed
as a relatively small price to pay for the general validity of analyses of the resultant multiply-imputed
database” (Rubin, 1996).

In multiply imputing missing values that have been artificially created in each scenario, we fit plot-level
OLS regression models with the GPS-based plot area as the dependent variable and obtain linear
predictions for all plots in the data set. Under the partially parametric method of predictive mean
matching (PMM), we use the linear prediction as a distance measure to form a set of 5 nearest neighbors
chosen from the plot sample with GPS-based area measures, and randomly pick one of the neighbors
whose observed GPS-based plot area value replaces the missing value for the incomplete case at hand.7

The imputation is carried out 50 times8 to reduce the potential sampling error due to imputation, and 50
complete data sets are generated. The posterior estimates of the model parameters are obtained using
sampling with replacement, which is standard practice when the asymptotic normality of parameter
estimates is suspect.9 By drawing from the observed data, PMM preserves the distribution of observed
values in the missing part of the data, which makes it more robust than the fully parametric regression
approach. In total, we generate 50 complete data sets of GPS-based land plot areas for each of rate
missingness (100) for each distance threshold for each country data set. These data sets are used to assess
the tolerable rates of missingness, as explained below.




7
  The results are robust to using linear regression, as opposed to PMM. The number of nearest neighbors in the PMM
framework is inversely related to the correlation among imputations. While high correlation may increase the
variability in MI point estimates, low correlation may increase the bias in MI point estimates. The literature does not
provide definitive guidance on the decision regarding the number of nearest neighbors, but the results are robust
to the specification of ten nearest neighbors, with or without bootstrapping.
8
  The results are robust to performing 100 imputations instead.
9
  The results are robust to sampling estimates from the posterior distribution of model parameters, as opposed to
bootstrapping.

3.3 Assessing the tolerable rates of missingness in GPS-based plot areas

In order to assess the performance of the imputation model, we compare, the distributions of the true,
observed versions of key variables that rely on GPS-based plot areas with the distributions of their
completed (observed plus imputed) counterparts. The key outcomes that our assessment focuses on is
GPS-based plot area and plot-level agricultural productivity, which is measured as the quantity or value of
crop harvested based on farmer-reporting (the numerator) over cultivated land (the denominator). As
discussed earlier, plot-level agricultural productivity is of policy relevance.

Given the nature of the problems to which MI is applied, it appears difficult for analysts to verify the
appropriateness of their imputation procedures. Imputation values are guesses of unobserved, unknown
values (Abayomi, et al., 2008). In this study, however, missingness is artificially created such that the true
values are known. This allows direct comparison of the distributions of the observed vs. the completed
data. Numerically, the comparison of the empirical distributions is done using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) test for each outcome variable for the different levels of missingness, raising the flag when there are
statistically significant differences at the 5 percent level10 for at least 1 of the 50 imputations generated.


4 Results

The results of our simulations are illustrated in Figure 1. Each panel shows the results for one threshold
of one data set. The first panel, for example, shows the result for the IHS3 when we impose a threshold
of 1 kilometer. In each panel, the y-axis shows the number of imputations out of 50 for which, the KS test
indicates that the distribution of the relevant outcome variable derived from the imputed GPS-based land
area, was statistically indistinguishable from its observed counterpart. We also highlight the tolerable
rates of missingness with a vertical line. The x-axis, on the other hand, shows the percentage of simulated
missing GPS-based plot areas measurements beyond a given distance threshold. Three general
observations emerge from Figure 1.

First, for low rates of missingness, all 50 imputations are statistically indistinguishable from the true
distribution. As the rate of missingness increases, this count starts to decrease until only a small number
(between 0 and 10) of the imputations appear to have distributions that are not statistically different from
the observed true distribution. Second, within each data set, the tolerable rate of missingness is lower for
500 meters than it is for 1 km. Third, plot-level agricultural productivity is more sensitive to missingness
than plot area (i.e. the tolerable rate of missingness is reached earlier in the case of the latter).



10
   The p-values for the test are approximate. The imputations are generated from the observed data. Hence, the
empirical distributions are not independent of the observed data. (Abayomi, et al., 2008) note that there is no reason
to suppose that setting a 5 percent level of significance will be appropriate when producing a MI diagnostic through
density comparisons. However, we do not want to base our recommendations on marginally significant results, say
at the 10 percent level, and determining the tolerable rate of missingness based on statistically significant imputed
distributions in only 1 out of 50 attempts is already a strict approach.

                                                                                                                    9
The first and second observations confirm the expectations anchored in the descriptive analyses discussed
in Section 2. Plots that are further from the dwelling are inherently different from the ones that are closer.
Thus, as missingness increases, the pool of plots with similar characteristics (and thus comparable areas)
to choose from gets smaller, and it is understandable that the distribution differs substantially. The third
observation is also foreseen: land area being the denominator of the formula for yield, a small deviation
of the imputed values from the observed land values brings about a relatively more important deviation
in the yield estimates obtained from them. Consequently, the yields calculated from the imputed land
areas differ substantially from the true yields at lower rates of missingness.

We now compare the results obtained in the different panels depicted in Figure 1. For convenience, the
tolerable rates of missing GPS-based plot areas are summarized in Table 7. Along with the tolerable rates
in terms of the percentages of plot areas observations that could go missing beyond a given distance
threshold, we report the corresponding overall rates of missingness in parentheses. In the discussion that
follows, we focus on the discussion of the results pertaining to plot-level agricultural productivity, given
the policy relevance of the outcome and its lower tolerance to missingness vis-à-vis plot area.

The results obtained with the 1 kilometer threshold are very encouraging. In IHS3, the MI procedure can
produce imputed yields that are statistically undistinguishable from the true distributions at rates of up
to 82 percent. For Ethiopia, the comparable figure is 56 percent, indicating that the plot-level agricultural
productivity estimation is more sensitive, compared to Malawi, to missingness among the GPS-based plot
areas that are beyond the 1 kilometer threshold. These rates translate into overall tolerable missingness
rates of 23 percent and 13 percent in Malawi and Ethiopia, respectively.

As noted above, we get lower tolerable rates of missingness among distant GPS-based plot areas when
we lower the threshold from 1 kilometer to 500 meters. In this case, the MI procedure can produce
imputed yields that are statistically undistinguishable from the true distributions with up to 45 percent
missingness among distant GPS-based plot areas in Malawi. The comparable figure is 36 percent for
Ethiopia. These rates translate into overall tolerable missingness rates of 21 percent and 15 percent in
Malawi and Ethiopia, respectively.

The cross-country differences in tolerable missingness rates are likely in part tied to the differences in
farm organization.11 On the one hand, the average plot size in hectares in Malawi (0.4) is twice as much
as the comparable statistic in Ethiopia (0.2), as reported in Table 3. On the other hand, the household-
level average number of plots per holding in Ethiopia (11.7) is more than six times the comparable figure
in Malawi (1.9). While the spatial distribution of the plot samples across the distance intervals in Table 2
are comparable across the two settings, the average plot distance from the dwelling is 2.19 kilometers in
Malawi, with a 95 percent confidence interval of 1.91-2.47, versus 1.10 kilometers in Ethiopia with a 95
percent confidence interval of 0.76-1.43. The plot distance from the dwelling further exhibits cross-
country distributional differences that are statistically significant at the 1 percent level.

11
  Unless otherwise stated, the statistics in this paragraph are not reported in any of the tables, but have been
computed based on the same data sets used for analysis.

                                                                                                             10
Finally, Table 8 presents country-specific multiply-imputed mean versus true mean comparisons for plot-
level area and agricultural productivity, following MI at identified tolerable rates of missingness above the
distance thresholds as reported in Table 7. Irrespective of the distance threshold and country in question,
the root mean square error for plot area is close to zero and the difference between the MI mean and the
true mean as a percentage of the true mean does not exceed 1.5 percent. For plot-level agricultural
productivity, we have more promising findings in Malawi compared to Ethiopia. In Malawi, at 82 percent
missingness above the 1 kilometer threshold, the difference between the MI mean and the true mean as
a percentage of the true mean stands at 7.5 percent. The comparable statistic for Ethiopia is 40.4 percent.
These findings underscore the relative sensitivity to missingness of plot-level agricultural productivity
measures vis-à-vis plot area, and the fact that this sensitivity likely varies by country/farming system.


5 Conclusion

This paper provides further evidence that combining GPS-based plot area measurements with farmer-
reported plots areas in a Multiple Imputation (MI) application can result in reliable simulations of missing
GPS-based plot areas. While the idea was first pursued by (Kilic, et al., 2017) using data from Tanzania and
Uganda, our analysis extends the pursuit with data from Malawi and Ethiopia with negligible levels of
missing GPS measurements. By artificially simulating the missingness in otherwise assumed-to-be-
complete data from these two settings, we compare the MI-based predictions to the true, observed values
and gauge the levels of missingness in GPS-based land area measurements that can be handled with MI
without compromising key land area related statistics.

Plot-level agricultural productivity measures are found to be more sensitive to missingness. Still, in
Malawi, MI can produce imputed yields that are statistically undistinguishable from the true distributions
with up to 82 percent missingness in plot areas that are further than 1 kilometer with respect to the
dwelling location. The comparable figure in Ethiopia is 56 percent. In other words, if only 18 percent of
the distant plot areas in Malawi and 44 percent of the distant plots in Ethiopia were randomly selected
for GPS-based area measurement, one can generate reliable imputed plot-level measures for area and
agricultural productivity. In future surveys, this would result in significant savings in time and resources.

However, since the tolerable missingness rates vary by country, distance threshold and outcome variable,
prior to scaling up, it is imperative to replicate similar analyses using other survey data that exhibit low
rates of missingness in GPS-based plot areas in order to converge on comprehensive operational
guidelines for survey practitioners. Nevertheless, the potential of using MI for complementing missing
GPS measurements is evident and should be pursued whenever possible. Finally, although dealing with
missingness empirically in the post-fieldwork period is usually an option, there is no substitute for good
fieldwork to prevent unwarranted missing measurements as much as possible. Thus, we would advise
countries to follow a combination of (i) well-supervised field practices aimed at reducing missingness, as
exemplified in Section 2, and (ii) sound MI applications to fill the data gaps that will still be unavoidable
to a degree.
