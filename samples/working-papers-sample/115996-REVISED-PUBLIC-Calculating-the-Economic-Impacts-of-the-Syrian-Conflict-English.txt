          Calculating the Economic Impacts of the Syrian Con ict
         What damage has the Syrian conflict inflicted on Syria's economic infrastructure? What are the
                                implications of new infrastructure spending?



The World Bank in collaboration with RAND has

calculator combines data from the World Bank with           impact of destruction and infrastructure spending in six war-
insights from the economics literature to estimate the
                                                            torn cities in Syria: Aleppo, Dar'a, Hama, Homs, Idlib, and

spending in seven key sectors — agriculture, education,
                                                            economic sectors — included in the World Bank’s Damage

sanitation — in six war-torn cities. It allows users to
                                                            to estimate the extent of damage as of early 2016. For each
vary key assumptions about the extent of destruction
and intensity of infrastructure spending activity, and      sector, the calculator relies on three types of assumptions,
estimates the net economic impact on the gross              which the user can vary to forecast the economic impacts of
domestic product (GDP) of these six cities.1                future destruction and reconstruction activities:

The Economic and Social Consequences of Conflict in               the overall spending multiplier and in the long-term
Syria.                                                            through the sector-speci c output multiplier. The upper
     limit for the amount of reconstruction is the amount of
     resources that it would take to completely rehabilitate
     the damage to the sector. When reconstruction is set to
     the maximum, the net impact is often positive as a
     consequence of the direct economic bene t of
     reconstructing spending modeled through the spending
     multiplier.
     The e ectiveness of reconstruction spending and the
     impact on GDP are determined by three factors:
     spending multiplier, e ciency of reconstruction aid, and
     decreasing returns to spending. You can adjust each of
     these factors at the bottom of the calculator under
     "Advanced Options."

   3. Output multiplier: The change in long-term GDP
      associated with a sector-speci c change in economic
      infrastructure. For example, a value of 0.5 indicates that
      overall long-term annual GDP increases by $0.50 for
      every $1.00 of investment in that sector. The default
      values provided for each multiplier rely on a variety of
      assumptions, often derived from research in other
      countries that examines the productivity impacts of only
      small changes in infrastructure.

Use the information icons      to learn more about the default
values used for the share of infrastructure damaged and the
output multipliers in each sector. After adjusting the sliders,
selecting the    next to Change in GDP from Damage, Change
in GDP from reconstruction, and Net change in GDP will reset
values to default.

                                                         Changes in GDP resulting from reconstruction spending capture both the net

                                                         reconstruction resources. For simplicity the reported GDP changes include 10%
