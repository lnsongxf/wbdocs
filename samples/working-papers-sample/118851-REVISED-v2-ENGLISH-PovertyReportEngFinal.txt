Foreword
This report is the first of two poverty reports to be released by the Government
of Myanmar and the World Bank.

The Myanmar Poverty and Living Conditions Survey (MPLCS) was conducted in
early 2015 on a nationally representative sample of households. The survey was
undertaken through a close collaboration between the Ministry of Planning and
Finance and the World Bank. The principal objective of the survey was to provide
updated information on living conditions and socio-economic indicators in the
country. The survey used the Population and Housing Census of 2014 to establish
its sample, and was designed to be representative at the national, urban/rural
and agro-zone levels.

The data from the MPLCS survey was analyzed by a joint technical team from the
Government of Myanmar and the World Bank. The reports produced from this
analysis reflect the outcomes of this extensive and close technical collaboration.
The reports benefitted substantially from the guidance of a Steering Committee
and Technical Working Committee, both of which included representatives
from Ministries across the Government of Myanmar and from the development
partner community.

The first stage of the joint analysis is presented in this report. It documents that
Myanmar has made solid progress in poverty reduction over the last decade.
Using the poverty measure established by the Government of Myanmar in
2004/05 using the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey, this report
finds that poverty declined from 32.1 percent in 2004/05 to 19.4 percent in 2015.
Over the same period, average real expenditure grew, durable goods ownership
increased and households saw an expansion of their dietary base.

The report also presents a case for putting forward a revised poverty measure
that reflects the needs of Myanmar’s population in 2015. This recommendation
reflects international best practice for reviewing and updating the basket of goods
consumed by the poor; revisions of this kind are typically recommended every
ten years. The World Bank and Ministry of Planning and Finance will release their
findings on the new poverty measure in a second report that details the profile
of poverty in Myanmar.

       Executive Summary

A joint analysis of poverty and living standards

was conducted by a technical team from the

Ministry of Planning and Finance, Government

of Myanmar, and the Poverty and Equity

Global Practice of the World Bank.




                                               1
        The findings of the joint
        analysis are summarized in a
        two-part report:

    1   Part One puts forward trends in
        poverty over time. Annexes include
        the technical details of the poverty
        measurement exercise. This report
        also makes recommendations on the
        need to revise the poverty measure
        used to reflect the needs of the
        population a decade after poverty
        was first measured in Myanmar.

    2   Part Two (forthcoming) presents the
        poverty profile for 2015 based on the
        new poverty line.

Poverty has previously been estimated using data
from the Integrated Household Living Conditions
Survey conducted in 2004/05 and 2009/10. A key
objective of this part one report was to give an
assessment of poverty in 2015 using data from the
Myanmar Poverty and Living Conditions Survey.


Poverty in Myanmar has previously been estimated
using two different approaches.

Poverty was initially measured by the Government of Myanmar
and its development partners using data from IHLCA-I; this first
measure of poverty based the poverty line and estimate in the
living conditions of 2004/05. Poverty was estimated to be 32.1
percent in 2004/05 and was estimated to have dropped to 25.6
percent in 2009/10 (GOM et al, 2007 and GOM et al, 2011). A
poverty estimate based on 2009/10 standards of living was put
forward by the World Bank in 2014, using data from the IHLCA-II.
The World Bank estimated poverty to be 37.5 percent in 2009/10
(World Bank, 2014).




                                                              3
                                                       This report finds that living standards have improved
                                                       in Myanmar between 2004/05 and 2015, and that
                                                       poverty has declined.

                                                       Poverty is estimated to have declined from 32.1 percent in
                                                       2004/05 to 25.6 percent in 2009/10 and to 19.4 in 2015 using
                                                       the method first proposed by the Government of Myanmar and
                                                       its development partners in 2007, based on living standards
                                                       from 2004/05. Similarly, a decaline was registered using the
                                                       methodology put forward in World Bank (2014): using this second
                                                       method, poverty is estimated to have declined from 44.5 percent
                                                       in 2004/05 to 37.5 percent in 2009/10 and to 26.1 percent in 2015.

                                                       Increases in well-being were seen across a number of
                                                       indicators.

                                                       These improvements in well-being are also reflected in
                                                       multiple measures of welfare, including average consumption
                                                       expenditures and asset ownership.

Urban areas have seen faster expenditure growth
than rural areas.

While living standards in rural areas have seen substantial
improvements, the changes have been more limited than those
seen in Myanmar’s cities and towns. The share of the population
working in agriculture has remained broadly constant between
2004/05 and 2015, and growth in agriculture has been more
limited than growth in manufacturing and services.


Measures of inequality rose over the last five years,
albeit from a low base.

The rise in inequality is noteworthy but unsurprising, as individuals
with better education and more capital to invest benefitted more
from the early liberalizations and reforms. The rise in inequality
replicates the experience of reform periods seen in multiple
countries in the region. While the inequality figures in Myanmar are
not at levels that stand out from a regional or global perspective,
it will be important to monitor reform efforts to ensure that they
have the potential to reach the entire population. Supporting
stronger growth in Myanmar’s farms and villages will be vital,
both for reducing poverty and for keeping inequality in check.


The joint assessment recommends that the
Government of Myanmar consider revising and
rebasing its poverty measure in order to better reflect
living standards and the needs of the poor in 2015.

Myanmar’s poverty estimates are currently based on living
conditions in 2004/05, when poverty was first measured in
Myanmar. Since Myanmar and the needs of its poor have changed
in multiple ways since 2004/05, this joint technical analysis
recommends rebasing and revising Myanmar’s consumption
aggregate and poverty line. Updates to a country’s welfare
aggregate and poverty line are recommended approximately



                                                                   5
    every ten years to reflect changes in living conditions, such as an
    increase in the non-food share, and to reflect changes in survey
    and poverty estimation methodology. This revision is suggested
    at the end of the period of reporting for the Millennium
    Development Goals, and at the beginning of the new period of
    international monitoring for the Sustainable Development Goals.


    Living conditions and the needs of the poor have
    changed in three ways since poverty was first
    measured in 2004/05.

    First, the share of food in a household’s basket has declined
    while non-food items have become more diverse, raising the
    need to capture a greater diversity of non-food items. Second,
    and related, the number and variety of goods has increased,
    particularly for household assets. Third broad reforms have
    changed the spending patterns of households, as government
    resources to key services have increased allowing households to
    diversify the range of items they spend resources on. This report
    therefore recommends revising the consumption aggregate and
    poverty line to reflect the needs of the population in 2015.


    Following acceptance of the recommendation to revise and
    rebase the national poverty measure, Part Two of the poverty
    assessment (forthcoming) will present a comprehensive poverty
    profile using a revised and rebased new poverty measure for
    Myanmar.

                       Overview of Content

This report is the first report in a two-part

poverty assessment series. The reports

produced describe the estimation of poverty

in Myanmar by a joint team from the World

Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice and

Living Standards Measurement Survey Team,

and the Government of Myanmar, Ministry of

Planning and Finance (MOPF).




                                           7
        The joint analysis had 3
        interlinked objectives:
    1   To construct comparable poverty estimates over
        three survey waves;


    2   To present a measure of poverty that reflects the
        situation of poverty in Myanmar in 2015 and;


    3   To conduct analysis of the correlates and
        determinants of poverty, to provide an overview
        of the critical human and economic development
        needs in Myanmar.




        The technical collaboration
        between the World Bank
        and MOPF has led to 3
        reports:

Institutional Arrangements
A Steering Committee for the Myanmar Poverty and Living Conditions Survey
was established in July 2015 by the President’s Office. The Ministry of Planning
and Finance was represented by the Chair and Secretary, and the Ministries of
Health, Education, Agriculture and Rural Development, Livestock and Fisheries
were represented by members. Representatives from the development partner
community participated as members of the Technical Working Group and
Steering Committee. The Technical Working Group included representatives
from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Asian Development
Bank (ADB), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme
(WFP), International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) and International Growth Centre (IGC). The Steering Committee
included representation from the World Bank, UNDP and ADB.

                                          Background to the measurement of
                                          household living standards in Myanmar
                                          Prior to 2015, two nationwide surveys were collected in Myanmar that included
                                          comprehensive information on household expenditures.1 Welfare and poverty
                                          were twice measured in Myanmar using the Integrated Household Living
                                          Conditions Assessment (IHLCA), conducted in 2004/05 (IHLCA-I) and in
                                          2009/10 (IHLCA-II).2

                                          In early 2015, the Myanmar Poverty and Living Conditions Survey (MPLCS)
                                          was conducted to capture living conditions in Myanmar. Although the MPLCS
                                          is relatively small in scale, with a sample size of 3,648 households, the sample
                                          can be used to describe the national, urban/rural and agro-ecological zone
                                          level. It cannot be used at the state and region level. The MPLCS used the 2014
                                          Population and Housing Census to draw its sample.3

                                          1 There have been other surveys used to capture poverty in Myanmar. The Livelihoods and Food
                                          Security Trust Fund (LIFT) conducted a household survey in 2011, 2013 and 2015 in order to evaluate
                                          progress made in rural areas covered by LIFT programs. The results from these surveys are thus not
                                          nationally representative.
                                          2 The survey includes a nationwide representative sample of 18,660 households, based on a sample
                                          drawn from administrative population counts. The survey was comprehensive in scope, including
                                          modules on basic household characteristics, housing, education, health, consumption expenditures,
                                          assets, labor and employment, business, finance and savings. The survey was supported by
                                          development partners, and in particular by the UNDP, UNICEF, UNOPS and SIDA.
                                          3 The survey was comprehensive in scope, including modules on basic household characteristics,
                                          housing, education, health, consumption expenditures, assets, labor and employment, business, and
                                          finance and savings, as the IHLCA did, and additionally including modules on subjective well-being and
                                          self-reported incidence of shocks. The survey was supported by the World Bank Living Standards
                                          Measurement Studies (LSMS) and Poverty and Equity teams, and was conducted under the oversight
                                          of the Planning Department and Central Statistical Organization in the Ministry of Planning and
                                          Finance (previously the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development).

                                     Poverty Measurement using household
                                     surveys
                                     This section provides a brief introduction to key concepts that are used
                                     throughout the report.

                                     There are two principal steps in poverty measurement: the construction
                                     of a welfare aggregate and the construction of a poverty line. The primary
                                     elements of poverty analysis are described in Table 2.2 below, which defines
                                     terms that are reoccurring through this poverty profile.


Table 2.2

Components of welfare and poverty measurement



 Welfare                Welfare refers to an individual’s well-being or long-term happiness.



 Measure of welfare     Welfare is commonly measured in monetary terms, for example household expenditures or household
                        income. Households with higher monetary welfare measures are considered better off.


 Poverty line           The poverty line defines the minimum welfare level needed to not be considered severely deprived.
                        What is implied by a minimum need varies across countries and as a country develops. In countries
                        where people have severe difficulty feeding themselves, this is often benchmarked around meeting
                        calorie needs. In better off countries where food adequacy is no longer an issue but where worse
                        off households may be excluded or deprived in other ways (e.g. inadequate health care, limited
                        education), poverty may be measured relative to the average or median household.

 Poor                   The poor live in a household in which income or expenditures per person (or adult equivalent) is less
                        than or equal to the total poverty line.




                                     A welfare aggregate captures well-being in monetary terms. It includes four
                                     main items. The four principal items included in a welfare aggregate are food;
                                     non-food expendables spending which includes: spending on energy, taking
                                     buses or buying fuel for motorbikes, education and, sometimes, health; the
                                     use value of durables, which captures a value from using the home assets in
                                     the household’s possession; and finally the imputed value of the household’s
                                     housing.


                                     A poverty line defines the minimum standard of living that is needed for
                                     a household to live a reasonable life, meaning that they are able to feed
                                     themselves and to purchase basic non-food items. A household is considered
                                     to be poor if their welfare aggregate, effectively the value in kyats that they
                                     report consuming, falls below the minimum that is considered needed in
                                     Myanmar to support a basic minimum standard of living.

The year that a poverty line is based in matters for the estimate of poverty
produced. Even if the methodology to estimate a poverty line is completely
unchanged, a poverty line based in two different years will yield two different
poverty estimates. A poverty line is a benchmark that reflects standards of
living at a given moment in time – it is based in a particular reference year.
Poverty lines are typically anchored in food needs and using the food tastes and
preferences of the poorest households in a society. Poorer households tend
to consume a lower quality diets than richer households, with fewer calories,
more basic carbohydrates, and less protein. As households grow richer their
diets improve, they consume more non-food items and increase their range of
leisure goods. As the diets and consumption patterns of the poorest in society
evolves, the line that reflects their basic minimum needs should be revisited.


The headcount rate is the most commonly used measure of poverty. The
headcount rate captures the proportion of the population who live in poor
households. A household is defined as poor if their per capita (or per adult
equivalent) welfare is less than or equal to the poverty line. A household is food
poor if their per capita or per adult equivalent consumption expenditures lie
below the food poverty line.


The depth and severity of poverty provides a sense of whether the
deprivation is relatively shallow—with many people just failing to meet
their needs—or deeper and more dispersed. The headcount rate of poverty
captures the proportion of the population whose expenditures are lower than
what is needed to meet basic societal minimum food and non-food needs. The
headcount poverty measure is not sensitive to the depth of poverty among the
poor—if the number of people living below the poverty line remains the same
but the poor become better off, the headcount measure does not change. The
poverty gap and severity measures are sensitive to changes in welfare under
the poverty line. The poverty gap captures the depth of poverty using the
average shortfall from the poverty line; the poverty severity measure places
more weight on people who are further away from the poverty line.


History of poverty measurement in Myanmar
Poverty was previously benchmarked using the consumption patterns of
people in Myanmar in 2004/05. Poverty was initially measured in Myanmar
using consumption expenditures data collected from IHLCA-I in 2004/05.
The Government of Myanmar and its development partners established
a consumption aggregate to measure living standards, and subsequently
estimated a poverty line based on the minimum needs of the population in
2004/05. Using this benchmark and methodology, poverty was estimated to
be 32.1 percent in 2004/05, subsequently dropping to 25.6 percent in 2009/10
(GOM et al, 2007 and GOM et al, 2011). A poverty estimate based on 2009/10
standards of living was put forward by the World Bank in 2014. Using data from
the IHLCA-II to construct a consumption basket and define minimum living
standards, the World Bank estimated poverty to be 37.5 percent in 2009/10
(World Bank, 2014).

                                     Although there are a handful of technical choices that differentiate the two
                                     poverty estimates, only a few have substantial explanatory power. Due to the
                                     number of people in Myanmar living in difficult circumstances, small changes in
                                     assumptions can lead to large changes in poverty estimates:


                                     •	   The first significant difference is the base year used to anchor the standard
                                          of living measure and definition of poverty.


                                     •	   The second factor is the choice of adult equivalence parameters and
                                          application of the normalization process. These are used to convert welfare
                                          from household to individual.4      1




                                     These differences are explained in greater depth in Annex A1.




                                     4 When expressing consumption in per capita terms, people are treated the same regardless of age—a
                                     household with two adults and two young children would have the same number of individuals as
                                     a household with four adults. If young children are seen as having different needs than adults—for
                                     example, a baby needs fewer calories than an adult male¬—then a household with four adults would
                                     have more adult equivalents than a household with two adults and two young children.

  2004/05 and 2015. Both measures find
  consistent declines of a similar magnitude.

•	 Standards of living have increased more
  rapidly in urban areas than in rural.

increased from just under 10 percent of households to a quarter of households
in 2009/10, 39% in 2014 and just over 42 percent of households in 2015 (GoM

Growth has been faster in urban areas over the decade. An acceleration
of growth in real expenditure per adult equivalent in the 2009/10 to 2015
period was clearly seen in rural areas. Growth in the last decade was lower in
rural areas than in urban: 1.1 percent per annum in rural areas compared to 1.9
percent in urban areas using the GoM et al. (2007) method. Growth in average
real expenditure was faster in the second half of the last decade in rural areas,
where annualized growth increased from 0.8 percent between 2004/05 and
2009/10 to 1.4 percent between 2009/10 and 2015 using the GoM et al (2007)
aggregate.10 11 By contrast to the growth seen on average in the population, in

rural areas there is no demonstrable change in welfare among the bottom 10
percent. In rural areas a similar increase in well-being can be seen for those
above the 10th percentile.


A study of livelihoods in rural Myanmar upholds the finding of improvements
in living standards. The Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT)
conducted an analysis of changes in multiple indicators of living standards
between 2011 and 2013 (LIFT, 2015). Although the analysis was designed as an
evaluation of their programming, an assessment of control areas can provide
a sense of the change in living conditions in these areas not targeted by the
organization’s poverty alleviation programs. In the two years between the
surveys, there was a substantial increase in household dietary diversity in the
control communities and an increase in the number of households reporting
eating eggs, meat, and dairy. There was also a notable decline in the reported
incidence of households not having sufficient food to meet their needs.


Changes in Inequality in Myanmar
Inequality refers to disparities between individuals or households. There are
many types of inequality in society. Inequality in outcomes refers to differences
in well-being, or in measured income and consumption, which are closely linked
to individual and household welfare and living standards. Inequality in outcomes
is the result of inequality of opportunities, societal institutions, effort, and luck.
In this analysis, we focus on inequality in measured consumption.

We use a number of alternative measures to describe the distribution of
incomes in Myanmar. Measures include the Gini, the Theil-L, the Theil-T, and
the ratio of incomes between households in the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles.


9 Our estimates of consumption growth per adult equivalent between 2004/05 and 2009/10
are slightly higher than those reported in GoM et al (2011) since we report estimates of per adult
equivalent growth while GoM et al (2011) reports household growth.
10 In urban areas, mean expenditure per adult equivalent grew by 2.0 percent between 2004/5 and
2009/10 and 1.9 percent between 2009/10 and 2015.
11 Using the World Bank (2014) method, growth over the decade was 2.3 percent in rural areas
compared to 3.5 percent in urban areas. Growth accelerated in both rural and urban areas. In rural
areas, mean expenditure per adult equivalent grew by 2.9 percent between 2009/10 and 2015, up
from annualized growth of 1.8 percent between 2004/05 and 2009/10.

                                                 The analysis presented in the discussion on trends in this section is subject
                                                 to the caveat that it uses the most comparable constructed consumption
                                                 aggregates directly from the household survey using the new aggregate. We
                                                 do not report inequality numbers for the GoM et al (2007) methodology since
                                                 we are unable to construct comparable estimates from the household survey.


                                                 Inequality in Myanmar remains at levels comparable to or below those of
                                                 other neighboring countries. Inequality is lower in countries where individuals
                                                 are similar to one another, where there are few disparities to mark them apart.
                                                 The relatively low levels of inequality still seen in Myanmar are a reflection of the
                                                 compactness of the expenditure distribution – there are many individuals who
                                                 live in poverty or near the poverty line. There are some households at the top
                                                 of end of the distribution who show markedly different consumption patterns,
                                                 in particular in their ownership of higher value durables. These households
                                                 act to push up the Gini coefficient and others measures of inequality. Many of
                                                 the countries in South East or East Asia with similar inequality figures have
                                                 lower poverty rates, larger non-farm sectors and greater variation in the
                                                 sectoral composition of their labor markets and real sectors. At similar stages
                                                 of development, Gini coefficients in Vietnam and Thailand were in the low 30s
                                                 (Government of Thailand, 2012; World Bank, 2012). The relatively moderate
                                                 inequality figures for Myanmar therefore need to be considered in the broader
                                                 context of the level of economic development and economic structure.

                                                  Inequality within urban areas is substantially higher than inequality within
                                                  rural areas. This is consistent with typical findings in other South East and East
                                                  Asian countries when they were at similar levels to development to Myanmar.
                                                  The Theil index of inequality can be decomposed to signal the contribution
                                                  of inequality within urban and rural areas relative to differences in average
                                                  standards of living between these areas (within versus between inequality).
                                                  The majority of inequality in Myanmar is attributable to inequality within
                                                  urban and within rural areas. Although only 30 percent of the population live
                                                  in urban areas, because inequality levels in urban areas are substantially higher,
                                                  inequality within these areas accounts for almost as much of total inequality as
                                                  inequality within rural areas.

                                                  All measures point to a rise in disparities, with a notable increase occurring
                                                  at the bottom end of the expenditure distribution. Households at the top 90th
                                                  percentile have seen faster consumption growth than those at both the bottom
                                                  10th and the median household. As seen in Figure 3.5 below, the ratio of the
                                                  expenditures of the 90th percentile relative to those at the 10th percentile rises
                                                  sharply from 3.1 in 2009/10 to 3.7 in 2015, and similar, albeit smaller, increases
                                                  are seen relative to households at the median of the distribution. The share of
                                                  expenditures going to the bottom 20 percent and to the bottom 40 percent
                                                  has declined since 2009/10.

        Box 1: How do we measure inequality?

        How is inequality measured?

        The most commonly used measures of inequality—the Gini, the class of generalized entropy measures
        including the Theil, and ratios of outcomes of people at different percentiles of the outcome distribution—
        capture inequality in relative terms. The most widely used measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient. It
        is based on the Lorenz Curve, which compares the distribution of welfare that exists in a society with the
        distribution under complete equality. The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of welfare
        of individuals or households deviates from the perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of zero represents
        perfect equality, while an index of 1 implies perfect inequality. The Gini coefficient takes on values between 0
        and 1 with zero interpreted as no inequality.

        Inequality measures differ in terms of their sensitivity to different segments of the income distribution, and
        thus collectively provide a good picture of distributional changes. For example, the Gini is most sensitive to
        changes in the middle of the distribution, while the Theil-L is more affected by changes in the lower tail of the
        distribution and the Theil-T is more affected by changes at the upper tail of the distribution.

                                                  The growth elasticity of poverty reduction

                                                  The growth elasticity of poverty captures how effectively growth has
                                                  translated into poverty reduction. The total growth elasticity of poverty
                                                  reduction is the percent change in poverty with respect to a one percent change
                                                  in per capita GDP (or mean expenditure per capita).

     The growth elasticity of poverty reduction was estimated to be lower than
     the average found in other countries. The GoM et al (2007) method estimates
     the average growth elasticity over the entire decade of -2.6 while the World
     Bank (2014) method estimates -1.3. This implies that for a 1 percent increase
     in mean expenditures, poverty declined by 2.6 and 1.3 percent based on the
     GoM et al (2007) and the World Bank (2014) methods, respectively. Myanmar’s
     growth elasticity over the entire period lies just below the average elasticity
     found in other countries with a substantial fraction of the population living in
     absolute poverty. Across these countries, a one percent increase in mean per
     capita expenditures or GDP has been found to contribute an average of three
     percent to poverty reduction (Ravallion and Chen, 1997) although the median
     elasticity is closer to 2 (Bourguignon 2002).


     It is common to find different estimates of the growth elasticity of poverty
     when using alternative measures of economic growth, though the discrepancy
     appears larger in Myanmar. Measures of poverty reduction appear much more
     responsive to survey-based household consumption growth than to growth
     measured using national accounts. When growth is measured by changes in
     real GDP the growth elasticity of poverty is around -0.3 for both the GoM et al
     (2007) and the World Bank (2014) methodologies, indicating that a 1 percent
     increase in economic growth will reduce the headcount rate of poverty by only
     0.3 percent.12 A large literature discusses the inconsistencies between national
                    1




     accounts and household survey data (Ravallion 2001, Adams 2004), and the
     strengths and weaknesses of both. The discrepancies between the two include
     the definition of consumption in national accounts, inflation adjustment,
     omission, and measurement error. Although there is no clear consensus
     on which of these measures of economic growth is more accurate, growth
     measured from survey data is more closely related with changes in households’
     consumption and income and better reflects the spending behavior of the poor.




     Living standards and the macro-fiscal economic context

     In the period between 2009/10 and 2015 when marked poverty reduction
     occurred, Myanmar undertook substantial economic reforms. The reforms
     underway since 2010/11 have touched upon multiple sectors, from reducing
     red tape and bureaucracy (albeit from high levels) that stymies private sector
     development (World Bank, 2014b), to filling key infrastructure gaps. Foreign
     exchange, trade and investment liberalization have opened up economic
     opportunities and the space for investment beyond a small group of highly
     protected sectors. Increased public sector transparency and decentralization
     have started to gradually bring the state closer to the people.




     12 We use per capita GDP at constant Kyat from World Development Indicators between 2005 and
     2015. Using this series, GDP per capita grew 80.1 percent over this ten year period while poverty
     declined by 39.7 or 41.3 percent over the same period (GoM et al (2007) and World Bank (2014)).
     Growth is estimated using linear growth ratios.

                                                    Growth during this period has been comparable to other countries in the
                                                    region and also to high performing countries following the start of economic
                                                    liberalization. Myanmar’s economy has grown at an average of 7 percent a year
                                                    between 2010/11 and 2014/15 (World Bank, 2015a). Growth in the last five years
                                                    compares favorably to other countries in the region (Figure 3.8), reflecting pent
                                                    up demand and a rebound in economic activity supported by economic reforms.
                                                    GDP in countries such as Korea, Vietnam, China and others grew between 6
                                                    and 10 percent when the process of opening up their economies first began

                                                    The positive impact of ongoing reforms is reflected in the robust growth
                                                    of the services sector but has yet to be fully felt in the agricultural sector,

                                                    to annual growth between 2011/12 and 2014/15, contributing 3 percentage

                                                    important driver of this contribution was telecommunications, which has

                                                                                                                                           29
                                                 as a result of market liberalization (World Bank 2015a). The transportation
                                                 sector further contributed a third of service sector growth over the same time
                                                 horizon, a reflection of expanding internal and external trade. Manufacturing
                                                 and construction sectors have also provided important contributions to growth.
                                                 As a consequence of higher-than-average sector growth the share of GDP
                                                 attributable to services increased between 2009/10 and 2014 from 37 percent
                                                 to 41 percent while the share contributed by the manufacturing increased from
                                                 26 percent to 29 percent.


                                                 Growth in services—and to some extent manufacturing—is likely to have
                                                 impacted the income-generating opportunities of the urban poor more than
                                                 the rural poor. Growth in the construction sector and in manufacturing has been
                                                 predominantly focused in urban and peri-urban areas that have better access
                                                 to reliable electricity and transportation infrastructure. The strong growth seen
                                                 in telecommunications is likely to have wide-ranging impacts on businesses
                                                 and consumers through falling costs of telecommunications services, and due
                                                 to increasing their accessibility and quality through investment in network
                                                 infrastructure.

Although agricultural productivity has grown over the last five years, the
potential of agriculture as a driver of rapid poverty reduction has yet to be
fully unleashed. The agricultural sector has not grown at the same rate as the
overall economy: agricultural growth stagnated at below 2 percent per annum
in 2011/12 and 2012/13, before picking up in 2013/14 and 2014/15. This resulted
in a decline in the sector’s share in GDP, from 37 percent to 31 percent.13 While
this is to be expected during an economic transition in which the structure of
the economy shifts from lower productivity agriculture to higher productivity
manufacturing and service activities, agricultural potential in Myanmar remains
below its potential. Around 54 percent of the country’s sown areas is planted
with paddy, but paddy yields in Myanmar remain among the lowest in the region,
adversely affecting overall growth, farmer income and poverty reduction
(World Bank, 2016). Well-managed irrigation schemes can yield around 4 tons
per hectare in Myanmar, but most fields average around 2.5 tons per hectare.
In contrast, the average per hectare yield in neighboring Thailand is 2.9 tons; in
the Philippines, 3.7 tons; and in Vietnam, 5.6 tons.


Recommendation to update the welfare
aggregate and poverty measures going
forward
The joint assessment of poverty recommends that the Government of
Myanmar consider revising and rebasing its poverty measure in order to better
reflect the needs of the population in 2015. In most countries, poverty lines
are revised from time to time to reflect the evolution of consensus regarding
what constitutes poverty (Haughton and Khandkar, 2009; Ravallion, 2016). The
definition of the basic minimum needs should evolve and be rebased in the face
of growth in standards of living and changes within society. The objective of
rebasing the poverty estimates is to align them to living conditions and needs
in 2015.

Living conditions and the needs of the poor have indeed changed in three
ways since poverty was first measured in 2004/05.


First, the share of food in a household’s basket has declined while non-food
items have become more diverse, raising the need to capture a greater
diversity of non-food items. An increase in household expenditures over time
influences both the share of food in the consumption basket as well as the
type of food consumed. We indeed see evidence of improvements in living
conditions reflected in the composition of expenditures: the share of food in
the GoM et al (2007) aggregate was 69.4 percent in 2004/05 and 68 percent
in 2009/10. In the bottom quintile, spending on food accounted for 74 percent
of total expenditures in 2009/10. Using MPLCS data in 2015, we find that the
share of spending going to food has further dropped to 62 percent on average
and 67 percent among the bottom quintile. Among the bottom quintile, the
share of spending on food is still higher as would be expected at 65 percent.14              1




14 These figures are estimated using the GoM et al (2007) methodology and the most comparable
aggregate possible using the MPLCS data. They are estimated using democratic weights – i.e. they
give the mean of the share, not the share of the mean.




                                                                                                 31
     Second, and related, the number and variety of goods has increased,
     particularly for household assets. The 2004/05 welfare aggregate excludes
     the welfare obtained from home assets, such as mobile phones and televisions.
     During this earlier time, ownership of these items was limited among all
     households and in particular among poorer households. The ownership and
     contribution to welfare of these goods has grown substantially over time. Our
     estimates suggest that these items have been more responsive to income
     growth than other components of the consumption aggregate.15 Leaving these            2 15 15   15




     goods out of the consumption basket may result in a slower decline in measured
     poverty going forward.16      3




     Third broad reforms have changed the spending patterns of households, as
     government resources to key services have increased allowing households
     to diversify the range of items they spend resources on. For example,
     between 2011/12 and 2013/14, the government quadrupled the budget on
     education (World Bank, 2015). The reforms are likely to allow households to
     diversify spending away from education.17 Although out of pocket spending
                                                            4




     for education is still substantial, these change in policies are likely to reduce
     the burden of schooling for households, particularly among the poor. Reforms
     that affect the composition of household budget are also seen in other sectors,
     for example between 2009/10 and 2013/14, there was a nine-fold increase in
     Ministry of Health spending (World Bank, 2015). A revision of the poverty line
     to better reflect the non-food component of spending by households in current
     day Myanmar is needed.


     Following acceptance of the recommendation to revise and rebase the national
     poverty measure, Part Two of the poverty assessment (forthcoming) will
     present a comprehensive poverty profile using a revised and rebased new
     poverty measure for Myanmar.




     15 The elasticity of durables with respect to total expenditures is greater than 3.
     16 Since these types of home assets tend to be owned in greater quantity and value by richer
     households, their omission is also typically associated with lower inequality figures.
     17 The reforms include the elimination of primary and secondary school fees, the introduction of
     compulsory primary education, the hiring of more school teachers, the expansion of a stipend program
     to over 100,000 poor students and the provision of block grants to schools to support school needs.

Annex A1
Methodological Difference
in Poverty Measurement
in Myanmar
Poverty in Myanmar has previously been estimated using two different
methodologies that were based on slightly different definitions of what it
means to be poor, resulting in two estimates of poverty for 2009/10. Poverty
was initially measured in Myanmar using consumption expenditures data
collected from IHLCA-I in 2004/05. The Government of Myanmar and its
development partners established a consumption aggregate to measure living
standards, and s bsequently estimated a poverty line based on minimum needs
in 2004/05. Using this benchmark and methodology, poverty was estimated to
be 32.1 percent in 2004/05, subsequently dropping to 25.6 percent in 2009/10
(GOM et al, 2007 and GOM et al, 2011a). A poverty estimate based on 2009/10
standards of living was put forward by the World Bank in 2014. Using data from
the IHLCA-II to construct a consumption basket and define minimum living
standards, the World Bank estimated poverty to be 37.5 percent in 2009/10
(World Bank, 2014).


The two previous poverty estimates are based on the same data and the
same time period. The estimates were however nested in slightly different
definitions of what it means to be poor, resulting in differences in poverty rates.
Due to the number of people in Myanmar living in difficult circumstances, small
changes in definition can lead to large changes in poverty estimates. Poverty
measurement requires some judgment calls and the differences in poverty
estimates presented here reflect alternative decisions. A detailed discussion on
the methodological differences between the GoM et al (2007) and World Bank
(2014) approaches to poverty estimation is presented in Table A 1.1.


There are three key differences in methodology that can explain why one
methodology estimated poverty in 2009/10 as being 25.6 percent, while the
other estimated it to be 37.5 percent.


The first difference reflects the base year for anchoring the standard of living
and definition of poverty. The GOM et al. (2007) methodology is based on a
basket of goods consumed by the poor in 2004/05, while the World Bank
methodology is based on a basket of goods consumed in 2009/10; the choice
of base year by the World Bank was a reflection of using the most recent data
available at the time of assessment.



                                                                                39
     The second difference between the GoM et al (2007) and World Bank (2014)
     methods reflects methodological choices, in particular how adult equivalence
     scales were applied. The most important difference between the poverty
     rates produced is the adjustment made to move from household to individual
     expenditures. Household surveys capture total consumption at the household
     level. Moving from household to individual welfare measures requires two
     steps: (i) choosing an equivalence parameter to represent the needs of
     different demographics in the population; and (ii) using normalization to adjust
     the poverty line after adjustment (Deaton and Zaidi, 2002; Ravallion 2015).


     Using this two-step approach, differences in adult equivalence scales should not
     affect the level of poverty but should instead impact the profile. In the absence
     of normalization, however, estimated poverty declines with the application
     of an equivalence scale. (Ravallion, 2015). For example, using an equivalence
     scale that reduces the needs of children over those of adults, households with
     children are likely to be relatively better off than those consisting predominantly
     of adults. A primary difference between the methodologies presented above is
     that only the first step was applied in the previous estimates produced in GOM
     et al. (2007).


     The final difference between the GoM et al (2007) and World Bank (2014)
     methods reflects the choice of food consumption parameters. The World Bank
     (2014) food basket was based on the total amount that the household reported
     consuming over a fixed reference period. The GoM et al (2007) food basket was
     based by adding up the total amount purchased, consumed from in-kind and
     consumed from own-production over a fixed reference period. The GoM et al
     (2007) measure could technically equal total consumption over a fixed period
     if (i) a household consumes entirely from own-production/in-kind; and/or (ii) a
     household consumed the total amount purchased during the reference period.
     However, this is unlikely to be the case on average since non-perishable items
     purchased in relatively large quantities such as rice and oil, are unlikely to be
     fully consumed. These items may also be consumed and not purchased, through
     drawing upon stores of previous purchases. Therefore we would expect some
     differences between the GoM et al (2007) measure of food consumption and
     household reported food consumption.

     Overview of Methods
     Used to Construct
     Poverty Trends in
     Myanmar
     A2.1 Methodological Issues
     A central objective of this poverty measurement exercise is to examine the
     evolution of poverty between 2004/05, 2009/10 and 2015. To compare
     poverty estimates over time, two principle components are required: (i) a
     measure of welfare that is comparable between 2004/05, 2009/10 and 2015
     and (ii) a threshold —the poverty line—that can be updated over time with an
     appropriate adjustment for changes in the price of living.


     Measures of welfare are sensitive to the design of the questionnaire used.
     The design of the questionnaires used to capture living conditions in Myanmar
     has changed over time. It should be noted that, while these changes in design
     reflect updates in survey methodology, they come at the non-trivial cost of
     comparability. As such, any benefit from updating a questionnaire over time
     needs to be carefully considered against the cost of reduced comparability over
     time.


     Estimates of poverty in 2004/05 draw upon measures of consumption that
     were captured through the IHLCA-I questionnaire, fielded in two phases in
     November-December 2004 and May 2005. Poverty estimates in 2009/10 use
     a broadly comparable questionnaire, the IHLCA-II. There were some design
     differences between IHLCA-I and IHLCA-II that may affect comparability of
     the consumption aggregates from these surveys, but the two surveys were
     broadly comparable. The IHLCA-II was enumerated in December 2009-January
     2010 and May 2010. Estimates of poverty in 2015 draw upon the MPLCS
     questionnaire. The three questionnaires differed in small but tangible ways that
     are likely to have consequences for the measured consumption aggregate and
     for poverty estimation.


     In this section, we describe key comparability issues between the MPLCS,
     IHLCA-I and IHLCA-II that are likely to affect the consumption aggregate
     and measured changes in poverty over time. We first examine questionnaire
     design, then turn to sampling and finally discuss the implications for poverty
     measurement. The imputation approach used to construct comparable poverty
     estimates cannot overcome differences in sampling, but is a valuable tool for
     dealing with differences in questionnaire design.




42
A2.1.1 Differences in questionnaire structure
Small changes to the design of food consumption questions have been
demonstrated to have substantial impacts on the measurement of food
consumption (see for example Beegle et al., 2012). A conclusion of the body
work addressing this issue is that it is difficult to state whether or not poverty
has changed over time if the underlying questionnaires have changed how they
ask about consumption. Box A 1 outlines evidence on how questionnaire design
changes can influence reported food consumption and measured poverty.


Although the MPLCS mirrors the basic structure of the IHLCA food and non-
food modules, design differences were introduced to reflect updates in survey
methodology. In addition, the number of items was slightly shortened to reduce
the length of the module devoted to consumption. This section describes in
greater detail the changes that were introduced between the surveys by walking
through the questions that lead in to the consumption aggregate, component
by component.

Food aggregate

The MPLCS questionnaire and field implementation deviated from the IHLCA in
multiple small but potentially important ways, notably: (i) the consolidation of
items; (ii) a shift in recall periods for consumed items; and (iii) a shift from fixed
to open recall periods for purchased items.18        1




i.	 Consolidation of food items. The IHLCA-I item list included 186 food
    items, while the IHLCA-II list included 228 food items. The MPLCS item list
    consisted of 184 food items. Food items removed were those that were
    consumed by less than 2 percent of households and which, among those 2
    percent of households, accounted for less than 5 percent of consumption.
    Table A 4.2 lists the items that were included in the IHLCA-II but excluded
    from the MPLCS aggregate. The share of total food accounted for by each
    item is shown. Taken together, these items represent a 0.647 percent share
    of calories in the total calories of the basket. The largest share of calories
    in the basket among the dropped items is sunflower oil, accounting for 0.14
    percent of total calories. For comparison, rice represents approximately 59
    percent of total calories.


ii.	 Reduction in the recall period for 46 perishable items, from 30 days to
    7 days. A shorter recall period tends to increase measured consumption.
    Therefore, measured growth in daily consumption of these 46 items may be
    upward biased due to recall differences.


iii.	 Shift from a fixed recall period to an open recall period for reporting
    purchase of items. A benefit of this shift is that it captures more household-
    level prices. This change however resulted in a loss of directly comparable
    data since this question was a component of the food aggregate underlying
    the official poverty estimates from 2004/05 and 2009/10.



18 A detailed overview of changes in the food and non-food modules of the questionnaire can be
found in the Annex A4.




                                                                                                 43
     The IHLCA-II questionnaire includes three questions that capture consumption
     in the household, and a question that captures purchases: (i) the quantity
     consumed in the last 7/30 days; (ii) the quantity and value of food items
     purchased in cash; (iii) the quantity acquired through barter, gifts and loans; and
     (iv) the quantity consumed from home production. The consumption aggregate
     behind the GOM et al. (2007) poverty statistics for 2004/05 (based on data
     from the IHLCA-I) consists of components (ii), (iii) and (iv). An assumption of
     including purchased values is that the household consumed the total value of
     these products during the recall period of 7 or 30 days. The MPLCS survey
     only included questions (i), (ii) and (iii). This change substantially affects
     comparability of any consumption aggregate produced directly with the survey
     consumption module of the MPLCS using the method of the GOM et al. (2010).

     Non-food components of the aggregate

     The changes to the non-food components can be summarized into three
     categories: (i) a change in recall periods; (ii) a change in the aggregation of
     items; and (iii) the inclusion of additional questions regarding durables.


     i.	 Change in recall periods for some non-food items. The change in recall
        periods for items such as education and travel for trips was necessitated by
        the implementation design of the MPLCS. The IHLCA was conducted twice
        a year, with a six-month recall, allowing for a twelve-month recall to be
        captured in the two waves of interviews. Since the MPLCS was conducted
        in a short time horizon over the course of three months, the recall for these
        less frequently consumed, “lumpy” non-food items needed to be adjusted
        accordingly.


     ii.	 Change in aggregation. The aggregation of non-food items reflects a similar
        exercise to that conducted for food items. Infrequently consumed non-food
        items that comprised less than 5 percent of the household’s basket among
        consumers were excluded.


     iii.	 Additional questions. In the household asset module, the most significant
        question added to the MPLCS addressed the amount paid for the asset
        at the time of purchase. The addition of this question allowed for the
        calculation of depreciation rates based on changes in the value of the asset
        over time.




44
Box A 1: Questionnaire Design and Comparability of Consumption Aggregate

The importance of consistency in questionnaire design to measuring and comparing consumption and poverty
over time cannot be overemphasized. While there are a number of examples to be drawn from country experiences
(see, for example, Deaton and Kozel (2005) for the case of changing recall periods in India), some researchers
have been able to demonstrate that even seemingly small differences in parameters such as recall period and
number of consumption items reported can severely impact measured outcomes.


To investigate the effects of changes in questionnaire design on consumption and poverty estimates, Beegle
and others (2012) conducted a controlled experiment in Tanzania. The objective was to see how changes in
parameters such as recall periods, disaggregation of consumption, and collection methods (diary versus recall)
might affect outcomes. Out of the same population, eight random samples of 500 households were selected
and information logged by individuals in a 14-day daily diary was established as the benchmark against which
comparisons were made. The samples were determined to be very similar across a range of demographic and
other characteristics.


The researchers found substantial variations in estimates when altering questionnaire parameters. Information
collected from a questionnaire using 14-day recall resulted in a mean consumption level that was 16 percent lower
than the benchmark level using daily diary data. A 7-day recall approach produced results only 4 percent lower
than the benchmark, but when the list of reported consumption items was significantly shortened, this difference
increased to 28 percent. Variations in estimates of consumption translate directly into discrepancies in poverty
measures. Using data from alternative questionnaires with varying recall and consumption list design parameters
produced poverty rate measures ranging from 55 to 68 percent, compared to 47.5 percent using the benchmark
data.


Jolliffe (2001) looked at two similar population subsamples in El Salvador, administering questionnaires to each
that varied in only one parameter. One sample was given a questionnaire with 75 food and 25 non-food items,
while the other received a list of 18 food items and 6 non-food items. The shorter list sought information on items
consumed at a categorical level (e.g., cheese) whereas the long list asked about consumption of various types
of items (e.g., types of cheese). The result was that the measured poverty rate was 46 percent higher using the
short list of items compared to the long list.


These and other examples demonstrate that changes to questionnaire design must be approached with caution
as variations in parameters can render measured results incomparable over time.

                                       A2.1.2 Sampling
                                       The discussion on sampling focuses on two differences between both IHLCA
                                       rounds and the MPLCS: the sampling frame and township covered.


                                       Differences in sampling are a concern for aggregate statistics, such as poverty,
                                       when the populations that are excluded from the frame (or that are more likely
                                       to be included) are systematically different from those that are included.

                                       Sampling frame

                                       A primary difference between the IHLCA and MPLCS surveys is the sample frame
                                       used. The sample frame is a complete listing of communities and households




                                                                                                                      45
     from which a sample can be drawn. The sample frame is thus a vital first step
     that defines the outline for the population being studied. An incomplete or
     inaccurate frame can give rise to non-sampling error, coverage or frame error.
     Census data are the main source of sampling frames and benchmark statistics
     for household surveys (United Nations Statistics Division 1986).


     The sampling frame used in the IHLCA-I is described in substantial detail in the
     2005 IHLCA Technical report (GOM et al., 2010). Since a recent census was
     not available in Myanmar at the time that the IHLCA-I had been conducted,
     the IHLCA-I, drew upon the most reliable population estimates available at that
     time. The IHLCA-II uses a modified sample design from the IHLCA-I. Notably,
     it retains a panel of 50 percent of households from the IHLCA-I. The panel
     component of the IHLCA-II allows it to directly assess the poverty and living
     standards dynamics of the same households over time, a considerable strength.


     The sampling frame of the MPLCS is based on the 2014 Population and Housing
     Census of Myanmar, conducted by the Department of Population. The sample
     frame was based on preliminary results and maps from the Census, and included
     enumerated and non-enumerated populations living in conventional housing.


     The population estimates emerging from the two surveys differ. Table A 2.1
     shows the population and housing counts from the three surveys and from
     the 2014 Population and Housing Census. The MPLCS closely matches the
     household and population counts of the Census.19 The divergence between the
                                                                    2




     population coverage from IHLCA and the Census emerges from three sources:
     (i) demographic change between the conduct of the IHLCA-II in 2009/10 and
     the Census in 2014; (ii) differences between the population estimate used as the
     sampling frame and the Census; and (iii) the omission of townships (discussed
     in the next section). The divergence between the population estimates and
     distribution from the 2014 Census and the earlier Department of Population
     estimates may affect the comparability of the IHLCA and MPLCS surveys.

     Township coverage
     The omission of enumeration areas (EAs) due to concerns about security in
     field implementation is an issue that has been faced in multiple contexts. This
     omission can positively or negatively affect national- and state/region-level
     estimates if the areas that are not covered are systematically different from
     those that are included.

     Due to concerns about security and transportation, 45 townships were not
     included in the IHLCA-I and IHLCA-II sample frames. In addition, wards and
     village tracts for which no household or population figures were available were
     dropped. At the time of enumeration, the estimated population that was not
     covered was 343,130 households, or approximately 1,787,708 individuals (GOM
     et al., 2010).


     Changes in the security and conflict situation by 2015 allowed the MPLCS to be
     conducted in townships that had been considered inaccessible during the field


     19 Small differences between the populations are likely attributable to differences in the definition
     of household in the MPLCS and the Census and due to a focus on conventional households. For this
     reason, the alignment of households is likely to be closer than the alignment of population.

Notes:

a.	   Household and population counts for the IHLCA-I, IHLCA-II and MPLCS are based on the summation of final household and individual weights in the
      respective datasets.

b.	   The Census population counts are based on the final results from the Population and Housing Census published in 2015. The population count reflects
      the population living in conventional households, 47.9 million, and also includes the non-enumerated populations, 1.2m. It does not include the 2.3m
      individuals living in institutional households.

c.	   The Census household counts are based on the final results from the Population and Housing Census published in April 2015. The household count

                                                        enumeration of the IHLCA-I and -II. As such, all townships in Myanmar were
                                                        included in the master sample frame of the MPLCS. Exclusions were however
                                                        conducted at an EA level. In particular, since national household surveys do not
                                                        cover institutional populations, 2,077 special EAs related to institutions were
                                                        excluded from the sampling frame, including four EAs related to monasteries
                                                        and one EA that covered the Myanmar diplomatic persons living outside the
                                                        country. In addition, non-enumerated EAs in Kayin (with a population of 69,753)
                                                        and Kachin (with a population of 46,600) were excluded.


                                                        The Population and Housing Census allows us to assess how changes to the
                                                        sample may affect comparisons of socio-economic characteristics between
                                                        the MPLCS and IHLCA surveys. We do this in two ways. First, we examine the
                                                        townships that were excluded from the IHLCA surveys to ascertain whether
                                                        their measured socio-economic characteristics are systematically different
                                                        from the Union and State or Region average. Second, we examine time-invariant
                                                        population characteristics between the surveys and population to assess
                                                        how changes in the sample may affect aggregate reported characteristics.
                                                        A comprehensive assessment of the townships included in the MPLCS, but
                                                        inaccessible from the IHLCA surveys, can be found in Annex A3.

                                          comparison of IHLCA and MPLCS
                                          The use of a different sample frame and township coverage in the IHLCA is
                                          likely to affect comparisons across the IHLCA and MPLCS.


                                          The imputation approach employed in this assessment cannot restore sample
                                          comparability. An assessment of the sampling differences however suggests
                                          that the decline in poverty between 2004/05, 2009/10 and 2015 would
                                          likely have been more pronounced, since the areas covered in the IHLCA
                                          were somewhat better off than those that were unable to be covered at the
                                          time. The poverty estimates presented in this analysis therefore should be
                                          interpreted as covering the population of Myanmar that, due to lack of conflict,
                                          were accessible at the time of the IHLCA surveys.


                                          A2.1.4 Implications of the comparability
                                          assessment for poverty measurement
                                          The comparison of the IHLCA and MPLCS surveys suggests that the substantial
                                          differences between the two surveys will affect the comparability of poverty
                                          estimates produced over time. This assessment however does not invalidate
                                          the findings of either survey. For poverty measurement and the construction
                                          of consumption aggregates, such small but important changes in survey
                                          design are likely to preserve the ranking of individuals across the consumption
                                          distribution.




     Box A 2: Use of Imputation Methods in Poverty Analysis
     In the context of poverty analyses, imputation methods have found numerous applications to address data
     gaps and statistical inference problems across space and time. An early and notable example of the use of
     imputation methods to restore comparability in the face of incomparable surveys comes from India in the early
     2000s. Changes in questionnaire design, among other factors, led to a lively debate on the extent and direction
     of change in poverty during the 1990s. Imputation methods suggested that the official estimates may have
     signaled a greater decrease in poverty than would have been implied had the consumption aggregates been fully
     comparable (Deaton and Dreze, 2002; Kijima and Lanjouw, 2003).


     A number of studies have verified the use of imputation methods by comparing predicted poverty estimates
     directly with observed levels in contexts where data comparability is not a concern. Christiaensen et al. (2012)
     draw upon data from Vietnam and China during a period of rapid structural changes and marked poverty reduction.
     They use these challenging periods of reform to examine the conditions under which imputation-based models
     produce accurate and robust estimates of poverty reduction. Even in these demanding conditions, they find that
     they are able to predict consumption and estimated poverty well using a fairly parsimonious set of predictors. In
     a similar vein, Yoshida (2014) uses household data from two comparable survey rounds in Sri Lanka. He uses two
     methodologies for imputation—one based on Elbers, Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2003) and the other based on Rubin
     (1987)—to produce results comparable to those derived from the household survey.




48
The issues in comparability necessitate the use of statistical methods that have
been developed to restore comparability in such circumstances. It should be
noted that these methods are not first-best options for ensuring comparability;
but are applied in the context of incomparable surveys. These methods are
discussed in the next section.

A lack of comparability of surveys is not unique to Myanmar. There is a vibrant
research literature around survey methodology, resulting in continuous
improvements in data collection approaches. It is therefore natural and
encouraged for surveys to evolve over time, to take on board the lessons from
the literature. Changes to surveys are also warranted as a country develops. For
example, products that were previously unavailable or unattainable may play a
greater role in purchasing patterns (e.g., infant formula and fortified products).
Imputation models can be used in poverty estimation to support a restoration
of comparability if there are sufficient comparable correlates of consumption
expenditures in the survey rounds.



Imputation refers to the replacement of missing values with “plausible” values
based on estimation methods and models. Imputation methods have a long
history in statistics and economics and have been used to address a variety
of missing data problems, see for example, Rubin (1976, 1987). Imputation has
established itself as a particularly valuable tool in the field of poverty analysis (Box
A 2). While originally conceived to fill data gaps within surveys, these methods
have been extended to cross-survey imputation, where one survey is used to
fill data gaps of another survey belonging to the same population. A review
of these methodologies by Ridder and Moffit (2007) shows how widespread
these applications have become also how they can be adapted to respond to
different types of missing data problems situations of incomparability, such as
that faced in Myanmar.


A more technical introduction to imputation methods is given in Annex A5.


A2.2.1 Application of imputation methods
We follow the following steps in the application of the imputation method:


Step 1: Identify Overlapping Variables. We identify household characteristics
that are comparably defined across the IHLCA-I, IHLCA-II and MPLCS surveys.


Step 2: Model Estimation and Selection. We estimate a model of household
consumption based on household characteristics in 2009/10 and 2004/05.


Step 3: Imputation and Validation. Once we are satisfied with the model, we
estimate poverty and mean welfare using a multiple imputation technique.


20 This section and its annexes draws heavily upon a background paper by Badiani-Magnuson,
Lanjouw, Prydz and van der Weile produced as part of the joint poverty assessment. The paper
contains further technical detail on the analysis that is presented.


                                                                                               49
     Step 1: Identify Overlapping Variables
     To use imputation methods, we need correlates of consumption that are
     measured in a comparable manner. By implication, if the questions from the
     two surveys had been fielded at the same moment in time they would produce
     the same summary statistics. To identify correlates of consumption that are
     comparable across time, we reviewed the three household surveys and their
     survey manuals to ensure that the questions were both asked and fielded in a
     similar manner. Where code structures did not entirely overlap across surveys,
     we constructed variables that were as comparable as possible. Finally, we
     examined the survey statistics of the variables and, where necessary, compared
     the variables against the 2014 Population and Housing Census to assess
     whether the trends seen over time were reasonable.

     The imputation approach has the best chance of identifying changes in
     poverty over time if these changes can be linked to changes in the observed
     independent variables (such as changes in housing conditions, asset ownership,
     and employment). Changes that are driven by exogenous shocks are not well
     captured by the observed data. We are therefore careful to exclude variables
     whose expansion is linked to rapid or substantial changes in market or availability,
     rather than linked to improvements in household economic circumstances.
     For example, ownership of mobile phones in Myanmar grew from 4 percent
     in 2009/10 to 33 percent in 2014 and 55 percent in 2015. The expansion of
     mobile phone ownership is reflective of substantial changes in SIM card prices,
     market deregulation and reform. We therefore do not include this variable in
     the analysis.


     Table A 5.1 presents the variables that were included as potential correlates of
     consumption. The variables can be separated into the following categories: (i)
     household assets; (ii) housing; (iii) household demographics; (iv) employment;
     and (v) education. At the time the analysis was conducted, we were able to
     compare some variables within the first three categories to those reported in
     the Population and Housing Census.

     Step 2: Model Estimation and Selection
     The following modeling strategy is adopted to build our models. The two main
     models discussed below are presented in Table A 5.3.

     First, we group the independent variables into sub-groups: demographics
     (household size, age composition, gender of the head of household), spoken
     language (by the head of household), education (of the head as well as
     other household members), employment (labor force status and sector of
     employment for the head of household), dwelling unit characteristics (roof,
     walls, flooring, access to electricity and safe drinking water, and use of cooking
     fuel), and asset ownership (rice cooker, refrigerator, fan, washing machine,
     stove, television, car, motorcycle, bicycle, etc.). Each of these groups of
     independent variables is regressed on (log) per adult equivalent household
     expenditure (with the urban dummy variable always included), which gives us a
     first idea of how the different types of variables rank as predictors of household
     expenditure. The dwelling unit characteristics and asset ownership variables
     rank as the strongest predictors, followed by demographics.




50
Next, we combine the groups of independent variables. Variables that cease
to be significant are dropped from the model. All categories of variables are
found to make an important contribution. Controlling for dwelling, asset and
demographic variables, the education and employment variables significantly
add to the goodness-of-fit of the model. Once variables from all groups are
represented, we explore whether or not any further improvements in the
goodness-of-fit can be obtained by including interactions with the urban
dummy to account for urban-rural heterogeneities. Throughout the procedure,
we assess for potential multi-collinearities and counter-intuitive regression
coefficients. All regressions are weighted using survey weights for individuals.
The result of this procedure is “Model 1”.


Model 1 is estimated both to the 2004/05 and 2009/10 data, as well as to a
pooled dataset combining the two aggregates, deflated to 2009/10 values. Our
imputation-based estimates of poverty for 2015 will arguably be most precise
when the model estimated to 2009/10 data (or 2004/05 data, or pooled
data) carries over to 2015, i.e., when the model exhibits a reasonable degree
of stability over time. With this in mind, we also look out for (economically
significant) changes in regression coefficients between 2004/05 and 2009/10
estimates of Model 1. By trimming variables that fail this “model stability test”
we obtain a second, significantly reduced model, “Model 2”.


Our preferred model for imputation is Model 1 as it is the most stable across
the surveys and poverty estimation methods. Nevertheless, it is important to
account for the possibility that the rapid expansion in the availability of various
household assets in Myanmar in recent years could reduce the stability in
the relationship between asset ownership and overall welfare. We therefore
also present results for Model 2, which relies on only a few asset variables
that demonstrate stable coefficients between 2004/5 and 2009/10, notably
owning a refrigerator, television and motorcycle.


Overall, the model coefficients are broadly consistent with expectations of how
household characteristics vary with household welfare: (1) per adult equivalent
consumption decreases with household size; (2) returns to education for the
household head are positive; (3) agricultural and casual work is associated with
lower consumption; (4) more advanced dwelling characteristics are associated
with higher consumption; and (5) asset ownership is strongly positively
correlated with consumption.

Step 3: Imputation and Validation
Once we are satisfied with the model, we estimate poverty using the multiple
imputation technique described in A2.2.1.

For imputing trends in the GoM et al (2007) poverty estimates between
2009/10 and 2015, we have the choice of estimating our model using the
2004/05 survey, the 2009/10 survey or the two surveys pooled into one
welfare aggregate. Because we are mainly interested in understanding the
most recent trends (from 2009/10 to 2015) in poverty estimates with both
GoM et al (2007) and World Bank (2014) method, our main results use models
estimated using the 2009/10 aggregates and use these models to impute
poverty for 2015 and 2004/05.




                                                                                51
     Imputations of missing consumption data from one survey to another
     typically assume that the estimated relationship between consumption and its
     predictors is stable over time—an assumption that cannot usually be tested
     directly. Although the list of food expenditure items expanded between
     2004/05 and 2009/10, all other components of the expenditure modules of
     the IHLCA-I and IHLCA-II questionnaire are unchanged over time. We therefore
     assess the stability of the sign of coefficient estimates over time and constrain
     our covariates to only include those that display a high degree of stability
     across different model specifications. We identify the model with the highest
     predictive power and with the greatest stability of coefficients across time.
     The model is tested by imputing consumption forward (into 2009/10, on a
     model based in 2004/05) and backward (into 2004/05, using a model based
     in 2009/10). Forward and backward imputation allows us to validate the model
     to ensure that the estimates are robust to the choice of base year and model
     specification.


     We are able to conduct these tests for the consumption aggregate from
     GoM et al (2007). We are unable to conduct this test using the consumption
     aggregate described in World Bank (2014). The World Bank (2014) aggregate
     is constructed using consumption in the last 7 and 30 days as the main food
     consumption indicator. As this question was asked in IHLCA-II but not in
     IHLCA-I, it is not possible to produce a comparable consumption aggregate
     using the World Bank (2014) methodology in IHLCA-I. We are thus unable to
     test assumptions one and two for the World Bank (2014) aggregate. In the next
     section we put forward three tests of assumptions one and two.



     A2.2.2 Validation and robustness checks
     We have conducted three validation and robustness checks that test the
     precision of the proposed methodology and models: (i) an indirect test of
     assumption one; (ii) a direct test of assumption one; and (iii) relaxing the time-
     invariant model assumption. The tests are conducted on the GoM et al (2007)
     aggregates for 2004/05 and 2009/10, so that imputed estimates can readily
     be assessed against official estimates based on survey data. 21               4
                                                                                       21




     First, in an indirect test of assumption one, we test the estimates from the
     imputation method against observed estimates from the surveys. The official
     poverty estimates from these surveys based on the GoM et al (2007) method
     show that poverty was reduced from 32.1 percent in 2004/05 to 25.6 percent
     in 2009/10. The imputed point estimates show trends in the same direction,
     although generally with a slightly slower pace, particularly for Model 2. The
     imputed estimates, however, are within the 95%-confidence intervals of official
     survey estimates, reassuring us that the model performs satisfactorily both in-
     and out-of-sample.


     This validation exercise also helps us decide which of the three aggregates to
     use for imputing trends in the GoM et al (2007) poverty estimates between
     2009/10 and 2015. Because of the better performance of the estimates


     21 Further detail on these tests can be found in the background paper by Badiani-Magnuson, Lanjouw,
     Prydz and van der Weile. The paper contains further technical detail on the analysis that is presented.

imputed with the 2009/10 aggregate, and the fact that we are mainly interested
in understanding the most recent trends in poverty estimates with both GoM et
al (2007) and World Bank (2014) methods, we choose to present as our main
results those based on the 2009/10 aggregate.


Second, to directly asses the validity of the assumption that the model is stable
over time, we examine the stability of the sign and magnitude of coefficient in
our models across the surveys. In the process of selecting the model where
we exclude coefficients that demonstrate instability, we implicitly ensure that
assumption one is satisfied. While the magnitudes of the coefficients vary, it is
clear they are fairly stable across the surveys for most, although not all models.


Third, we conduct a robustness check that relaxes the assumption of time-
invariant coefficients. All imputation-based poverty estimates thus far have
been obtained under the assumption that the model that describes household
consumption expenditure is stable over time, such that a model estimated to
data from 2009/10 can be applied to obtain estimates of poverty in 2015. We
can relax this assumption by explicitly modeling selected regression coefficients
as linear functions of time. The linearity of the time-trend is imposed by the
fact that we only have two rounds of data on which to fit the model (2004/05
and 2009/10). When more rounds of data become available, more flexible
functional forms for the time-varying regression coefficients could in principle
be considered. For further details on this approach we refer the interested
reader to Nguyen and van der Weide (2016) who put forward this approach and
test it using a large set of countries.

                                               Estimation
                                               Due to concerns about security and transportation, 45 townships were excluded
                                               from the IHLCA-I and IHLCA-II sample frames. The excluded and inaccessible

                                               no household or population figures were available were dropped. At the time
                                               of enumeration, the estimated population that was excluded was 343,130

The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census was enumerated in the
townships that were excluded in the IHCLA sample. This dataset allows us to
make some simple comparisons of townships that were excluded from the
IHCLA sample and those that were included. The Census collected rich data
on the characteristics of households. Many variables, such as age, sex ratios,
household size, asset ownership and dwelling characteristics are strongly
correlated with the overall material wellbeing of households. For example,
areas where most people use electricity for lighting are likely better off than
areas which mainly rely on candle light or kerosene as the predominant source
of lighting. Principal component analysis of the Census data confirms such
general relationships.

Comparison of Included and Inaccessible Townships

Comparisons of townships that were included and inaccessible from the IHLCA
sample can help to assess whether the areas omitted were systematically
different than those that were included, and thus provide some indication of
the direction and magnitude of the bias caused by township coverage. It also
provides an opportunity to verify the share of the population excluded from
IHLCA sample.


Table A 3.1 compares the key characteristics of townships that were included
in the IHLCA with those of townships were omitted. For simplicity, the
characteristics of the townships are grouped with those that are associated
with the township being relatively better or worse off. A measure of overall
welfare is also summarized in a single index, produced with principal component
analysis across all the characteristics displayed. Table A 5.3further breaks down
the comparison state by state. All measures are weighted by the township
population size. It is clear that across nearly all variables assessed and across
all states/regions with excluded townships, characteristics associated with
being “better off” (electricity access, asset ownership, etc.) are higher in areas
included in the IHLCA sample frame than in those left out of the sample frame.
This would suggest that the townships excluded were likely worse off, and, as
such, poverty estimates may be higher if all townships could be included in the
sample. It is however not possible to give a precise estimate of the magnitude
of this effect. The overall populations in omitted townships suggest that the
share of population omitted from the sample frame is 4.8 percent, similar to the
estimate provided in the IHCLA-I technical documentation (GOM et al., 2010).

                                     Characteristics

                                     An analysis of overlapping and time-invariant characteristics demonstrates
                                     how changes in sample design may affect poverty rates. We conduct an analysis
                                     of completed education using a birth cohort analysis. In Table A 3.2, we focus
                                     on individuals born between 1975 and 1989; further cohorts and disaggregation
                                     are displayed in Table A 3.4.


                                     These individuals were: (i) 25 to 39 years old at the time of enumeration in the
                                     Census in 2014; (ii) 26 to 40 years old at the time of enumeration in the MPLCS;
                                     and (iii) 20 to 34 years old at the time of the enumeration of the IHLCA-II.


                                     The profile of adult education in the MPLCS closely matches the profile of
                                     education for the same population from the Census. A deviation however can
                                     be seen at the lower end of the education distribution: the MPLCS has a slightly
                                     greater share of individuals with no education. This can be seen most starkly in
                                     the Coastal region, and may be attributable to the inclusion of non-enumerated
                                     populations in this area.


                                     The profile of the adult population in the IHLCA diverges from the Census in a
                                     stable manner across the three birth cohorts. In all three cohorts, the sample
                                     appears to be more educated (with more high school-educated people) than
                                     portrayed in the Census and the MPLCS. The higher share of individuals
                                     educated at a high school level and above can be seen across all agro-ecological
                                     zones for all birth cohorts.


                                     This analysis supports the conclusion of the township coverage analysis, notably
                                     that the sample frame changes will likely affect poverty comparisons.

A5.1 Theory: imputation methods
We adopt a standard imputation approach that is commonly used in the case of
missing data.22 When a variable of interest is missing altogether in a given data
                 1




set, one can still proceed with imputing this variable provided that a second
data set representative of the same population is available that does contain
the variable of interest. This second data set is needed to identify a prediction
model that can be used to generate the imputed values in the primary data
set. A prerequisite is that the two data sets share a set of covariates that are
sufficiently correlated with the missing variable.


We use the following standard linear regression model for log of household
expenditure per capita: where x denotes a vector of independent variables (e.g.,
variables on demographics, education, employment, housing conditions, asset
ownership) including the constant, u denotes a vector of independent errors
with zero expectation, and the subscripts i and t indicate household i and time
t. The superscript ‘T’ indicates matrix transpose.


                                         ln(yti )=xtiT βt+uti


We have three data sets collected at different times: the IHLCA-I (2004/2005),
IHLCA-II (2009/10) and the MPLCS (2015) survey data. All three surveys contain
the regressors of interest x, but only some surveys contain the consumption
aggregates of interest:


i.	    The IHLCA-I and IHLCA-II contain the consumption aggregate corresponding
       to the GOM et al. (2007) method.


ii.	   The IHLCA-II contains the information needed to construct the consumption
       aggregate using the World Bank (2014) method. The World Bank (2014)
       method cannot be applied to the IHLCA-I survey due to key variables being
       missing in the IHLCA-I.


The objective of the imputation exercise is to use the above model, estimated
using the IHLCA-I, IHLCA-II and MPLCS data to impute household expenditure
backwards and forwards. We then use the imputed expenditure data to derive
comparable poverty estimates.



22 This section draws heavily on Douidich et al. (2015).




                                                                              65
     This approach relies on two principal assumptions that are tested with the data
     available.

     Assumption one: The model is time-invariant, meaning
     that βt=β.

     The expenditures model is estimated using one time period (for example,
     using 2009/10 data) and then adopted for imputation in another time period
     (for example, imputed into 2004/05 or 2015). Under assumption one, this
     disconnect should have no impact on the results since the model underlying the
     data used for estimation and the model underlying the data used for imputation
     are the same. If the assumption does not hold and the model is in fact subject
     to variation over time, then ignoring this variation will introduce model error.


     This model can be tested with access to more than one household survey with
     comparable consumption aggregates. Since we have two broadly comparable
     rounds of IHLCA data in 2004/05 and 2009/10, we are able to test this
     assumption in multiple ways, discussed in greater depth below.

     Assumption two: The error term                  u is homoscedastic and
     normally distributed.

     This assumption can be relaxed by allowing for non-normality in a number of
     ways. For example, one could draw the errors from the empirical distribution
     of residuals (as in Filmer and Pritchett, 2001, and Elbers et al. 2003), or one
     could fit a mixture distribution of errors (as in Elbers and van der Weide, 2014).
     Heteroscedasticity could also be accommodated in a number of ways, such as
     working with a random coefficient model or modeling the error variances more
     directly (Elbers et al., 2003).


     We start off with a model that is based on assumptions one and two, then assess
     to what extent the data supports these assumptions. If the imputation-based
     estimates are consistent with the survey direct estimates for the available
     years, then one could make a case for not adding further flexibility to the model.
     If the imputation-based estimates are however not consistent, assumptions
     must be revisited sequentially in order to identify the source of the discrepancy.
     Incorrectly assuming normality of the error terms can, for example, introduce
     bias when estimating poverty or inequality (Elbers and van der Weide, 2014).
     In our case, a model based on assumptions one and two fits the data well as
     empirical results will show.


     Conducting the imputation
     We describe here the approach used to apply imputation methods to obtain
     poverty estimates in more detail. Define W(y,m;z) as a welfare indicator that
     can be expressed as a function of all household expenditures y, household size
     m and some poverty line z. Our objective is to estimate the expected value
     of this welfare indicator, E[W] given the sample of households. If we observe
     expenditures for the households in the sample, then the standard estimator for
     E[W] would be the sample direct estimator. For headcount poverty, this direct
     estimate would take the form:




66
Where 1(.) denotes the standard indicator function that equals 1 if the argument
is true, and 0 otherwise, and where w denotes the household sampling weights.
Other sampling design parameters will feature in the estimation of statistical
precision, notably sampling error. We denote the estimate of the sampling
variance by Un
             (0)
                 which declines with the sample size n.


We now examine the case where we do not see expenditures; in this case we
will be working with imputed expenditure data instead. In this case, sampling
error is no longer the sole source of error. The imputation-based estimator
will also be subject to modelling error. Imputing the expenditure data multiple
times for the sample of households is a practical way of taking into account
this source of error. In each imputation round, we draw a new set of model
parameters and household errors from their estimated distributions and use
these to impute expenditure. If we repeat this R times, we obtain R simulated
data sets, and consequently R estimates of the headcount poverty rate. The
imputation-based estimator takes on the following form:




Where y(r) denotes the simulated expenditures from imputation round r. We
denote the estimated sampling variance associated with Ht(r). An estimate of
the total variance (or standard error), which accounts for both sampling error
and model error, can be obtained by appealing to the law for total variance:


                    var[Ht(r)]=E[var[Ht(r)| y(r)]]+var[E[Ht(r) | y(r)]]

                                 1             1
                             ≅   R
                                     �Un
                                       (r)
                                           +   R
                                                   �(Hn
                                                      (r)
                                                         -Ht)
                                      r             r


The first component in this variance decomposition captures the sampling
variance while the second component captures the contribution to the variance
due to model or imputation error.


We conducted our empirical application of the imputation methods using
Stata’s MI package. A more detailed treatment of the multiple imputation (MI)
approach can be found in Rubin (1987).
