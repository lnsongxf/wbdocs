EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As the Indonesian government considers reform of its cigarette excise tax structure
and rates, concerns have been raised about possible effects of any such reforms on
tobacco farmers. Currently, Indonesia has a complex cigarette tax structure, which can
encourage downward substitution to lower priced products. Cigarette prices across all
tiers increased at a modest rate between 2010 and 2017 as the government continues to
increase cigarette taxes; nevertheless, cigarettes are more affordable now than they were
in 2000 in large part due to income growth. The main argument to adopt such a complex
cigarette tax structure is to protect employment in tobacco manufacturing and tobacco
farming.

Despite the concerns, tobacco leaf cultivation is a relatively small agricultural
subsector in Indonesia by economic size. Tobacco leaf has typically comprised
approximately 0.30% of the agricultural sector and 0.03% of gross domestic product
(Indonesia Ministry of Agriculture, 2010). Additionally, Indonesia has consistently been
a net importer of tobacco leaf to satisfy domestic demand, for example, importing an
additional 75,353 tons in 2015. The high levels of imports are also likely driven, at least in
part, by the fact that tobacco farming may not be a lucrative endeavor for many farmers
and does not attract enough farmers willing to undertake this agro-economic endeavor
to satisfy domestic demand.

This report aims to contribute to the policy debate over the reform of the Indonesian
tobacco excise tax system by reporting results of a nationally representative
survey of and focus group discussion with smallholder tobacco farmers that examine
their livelihoods and how tobacco tax reform might affect these households. The
survey sampled 1,350 current and former tobacco farming households across the largest
tobacco-growing regions in the country (Central Java, East Java, and West Nusa Tenggara).
The survey sampled smallholder tobacco farmers who grow the predominant leaf varietal,
Virginia, and other leaf types, including Burley, Oriental and a number of local varietals. It
focused on smallholder farmers both because they grow the preponderance of tobacco
in Indonesia and because they are likely to be disproportionately more vulnerable than
larger landholders in the event of any major policy change potentially affecting tobacco
farming. The survey also sampled former tobacco farmers—households that recently
elected to grow other crops instead of tobacco leaf—to understand if and how livelihoods
change when farmers switch to alternative crops and/or other economic livelihoods.

Contrary to the consistent tobacco industry narrative in Indonesia, the survey
and focus group discussion (FGD) findings strongly suggest that tobacco farmers’
livelihoods are not prosperous for most tobacco-farming households. In the FGD
data, many farmers described a dynamic in which they planted tobacco most years
understanding that most of the time it would not generate very much income, but occa-
sionally when prices were high and the weather was favorable, they could make extra
income growing tobacco. Notably, only a minority of tobacco-farming households relied
on tobacco farming as their major income-earning activity, even though many survey
respondents reported it as their primary job.

The main findings of this report include:

  •	 Tobacco cultivation was not profitable for most farmers. This finding was
     mostly consistent across regions, type of tobacco grown, and whether the farmer
     was on contract to grow tobacco.
     {{   Considering only direct costs (i.e., not household labor), most tobacco-farming
          households were spending more on their tobacco cultivation than the revenue
          they generated from it;
     {{   Incorporating a minimum value for household labor into the profit equation,
          overall profitability plummeted further;
     {{   Consistent with research in other countries, input costs for growing tobacco are
          typically very high in Indonesia compared to most other crops; and
     {{   Many tobacco farmers reported having limited capital—53 percent of tobacco
          farmers reported the need for loans to cultivate tobacco.

  •	 The opportunity costs of tobacco are high.
     {{   Most tobacco farmers spent disproportionately (to revenues) large amounts of
          time cultivating tobacco leaf compared to nontobacco farmers’ ratio of time to
          revenue; and
     {{   Because most former tobacco farmers spent far fewer hours in their fields, many
          engaged in other economically productive activities and could develop more
          robust and varied economic activities than their peers who continued to grow
          tobacco.

  •	 Tobacco farmers often miscalculate their return on investment.
     {{   Nearly 90% of farmers miscalculated their costs by more than 25%, and the
          average miscalculation was more than 50%.




                                                                                             9
The Economics of Tobacco Farming in Indonesia • Health, Population, and Nutrition Global Practice




   •	 Poverty is widespread among tobacco farmers in Indonesia. 72.2% of tobacco
      farmers are poor compared to 11.1% of the general population in the country.
      {{   Most tobacco-farming households were on social assistance in some form,
           including nearly three-fourths who used “rice for the poor” programs;
      {{   Food insecurity was common among tobacco-farming households—more than
           60 percent of households reported insufficient food for the household at some
           point in the year; and
      {{   Tobacco farmers in this survey were more likely than former tobacco farmers to
           display the symptoms of green tobacco sickness.

   •	 On average, former tobacco farmers were doing better economically than
      current tobacco farmers.
      {{   On average, former tobacco-farming households’ average total incomes ($3,797.68)
           were higher than current tobacco household’s total income ($2,921.19);
      {{   Former tobacco farming households typically generated more income from
           nonagricultural enterprises;
      {{   Former tobacco farmers’ mean nonlabor costs to cultivate their crops were less
           than a quarter of current tobacco farmers’ mean costs; and
      {{   Current tobacco farmers tended to be more dependent on social assistance and
           health care benefits provided by the government than former tobacco farmers.

   •	 Former tobacco farmers switched to other crops often due to economic reasons,
      such as low prices of tobacco leaf, more economically viable alternative crops,
      and cropping decisions based on weather.
      {{   Tobacco farmers who farmed other crops were more willing to switch completely
           away from tobacco; and
      {{   Older farmers were less likely to be willing to switch, as were Burley farmers. In
           contrast, contract farmers were more likely to be willing to switch. Farmers who
           had reported recent sickness were also more likely to be willing to switch.


Recommendations
The evidence presented in this report clearly shows that tobacco farming is not
economically viable in Indonesia for most farmers. Tobacco farmers were, on average,
experiencing significant economic losses, and engaging in less diverse farming/economic
activities, and thus, tended to be poorer and more dependent on government social
assistance than their nontobacco-farming peers. Given the associated economic and
social costs of tobacco growing, the government of Indonesia could make use of some




10 // Executive Summary
of the additional tax revenues from reforming the tobacco excise tax (estimated from 129 to
147 trillions of IDR—World Bank, 2016) to help tobacco farmers switch to alternative crops.

  •	 The government should help to improve supply chains and value chains for
     other goods in tobacco-growing areas.
     {{   Many former tobacco farmers are making a better living growing other common,
          locally grown crops (e.g., corn, sweet potato, and green vegetables), an outcome
          that could be further enhanced with even small investments by governments in
          improved supply chains for these products;
     {{   Results from this study suggest that current tobacco farmers are also already
          growing many of these crops, so it is an issue of encouraging and/or incentivizing
          them to shift their factors of production to maximize economic opportunity; and
     {{   Even modest programs to enhance value addition—for example, encouraging
          and/or incentivizing limited processing of crops (such as removing unusable
          portions of the plants)—could markedly enhance farmers’ incomes.

  •	 Encourage the expansion of markets—including exports—for nontobacco
     agricultural products to assure more sales opportunities for farmers.

  •	 Government should provide more and better agricultural extension services
     to promote locally viable, nontobacco crops.
     {{   Indonesia enjoys multiple growing seasons and other favorable conditions for the
          cultivation of many crops for smallholder farmers; yet, few farmers in this study
          reported currently receiving agricultural extension services for these nontobacco
          crops.

  •	 Improve farmers’ managerial and business skills.
     {{   More educated farmers will likely make better farming decisions;
     {{   Governments should provide training related to crop diversification, and financial
          and business literacy to help tobacco farmers make better cropping and business
          decisions; and
     {{   Education grants, for example, could support retraining programs for tobacco
          farmers and their dependents.

  •	 The government could help facilitate access to credit.
     {{   Provide grants or low-interest loans to farmers willing to switch to alternative
          crops; and
     {{   Introduce financial programs or economic development programs as forms of
          transition assistance away from tobacco cultivation.

                      INTRODUCTION
                      Tobacco leaf cultivation is a relatively small agricultural sub-sector in Indonesia
                      by economic size. The Directorate General of Estate Crops in the Ministry of Agriculture
                      estimated that in 2017, Indonesia produced approximately 198,296 tons of raw tobacco
                      leaf. As Figure 1 illustrates, this was fairly typical production for recent years. Tobacco
                      leaf has typically comprised approximately 0.3% of the agricultural sector and 0.03% of
                      gross domestic product (Indonesia Ministry of Agriculture, 2010). Each year, much of the
                      domestic crop is absorbed by the Indonesian tobacco manufacturing sector, though a
                      proportion is also exported—in 2016, it is estimated that less than one-fifth (30,000 tons)
                      was exported. However, Indonesia has consistently been a net importer of tobacco leaf
                      in order to satisfy domestic demand, for example, importing an additional 75,353 tons in
                      2015. The supply and value chains for tobacco leaf are global, and some leaf is exported
                      because of demand for particular Indonesian varietals in other countries, particularly
                      cigar tobacco (Keyser and Juita, 2005). The high levels of imports are also likely driven, at
                      least in part, by the fact that tobacco farming may not be a lucrative endeavor for many
                      farmers and does not attract enough farmers willing to undertake this agro-econoimc
                      endeavor to satisfy domestic demand.

                      Tobacco farming employs significant and concentrated pockets of farmers across
                      the country. According to Indonesia Plantation Statistics, there are currently more than
                      half a million farmers who cultivate tobacco in the country, which is about ~1.6 percent
                      of all farmers in Indonesia and about 0.7 percent of the total work force (see World Bank,

2017a). It is not clear from government data what proportion of these farmers are fulltime or
parttime. Most tobacco cultivation occurs in East and Central Java (~85%), while another
6–8 percent is in West Nusa Tenggara.

As the Indonesian government considers reform of its tobacco excise tax structure
and rates, concerns have been raised about possible effects of any such reforms
on tobacco farmers. Though there has been some recent research on tobacco farmers’
employment and livelihoods (e.g., Keyser and Juita, 2005; Mulyana, 2015), there has not
been systematic research based on nationally representative, household-level economic
survey data of smallholder tobacco farmers to understand better the nature of the typical
livelihoods of these farmers. This report fills this gap by reporting results of a nationally
representative survey of smallholder tobacco farmers with follow-up focus group discussions
(FGDs) to examine their livelihoods and to understand how tobacco tax reform might
affect these households.

The survey sampled 1,350 current and former tobacco farming households across
the largest tobacco-growing regions in the country (Central Java, East Java and West
Nusa Tenggara). The survey sampled smallholder farmers who grow the predominant leaf
varietal, Virginia, and the other major leaf types, Burley and Oriental. It focused on small-
holder farmers both because they grow the preponderance of tobacco in Indonesia and
because they are likely to be disproportionately more vulnerable than larger landholders
in the event of any major policy change potentially affecting tobacco farming. Because
contracts between leaf-buying firms and smallholder farmers are common, it also
sampled both independent and contract farmers to understand this dynamic. Finally, it
sampled former tobacco farmers—households that recently elected to grow other crops
instead of tobacco leaf—in order to understand if and how livelihoods change when
farmers switch to alternative crops and/or other economic livelihoods. This survey of
former tobacco farmers is the first of its kind and will illuminate how well former tobacco
farmers do economically after switching and how that compares to farmers who continue
to cultivate tobacco leaf.

Overall, the results suggest an economically unfavourable—i.e., unprofitable—
dynamic for most current smallholder tobacco farmers. The main findings of this
report include: 1) tobacco is not profitable for most farmers; 2) there is widespread poverty
among tobacco farmers (greater than the national average); 3) former tobacco farmers
on average are doing better economically than current ones; 4) there is widespread food
insecurity among tobacco farmers; 5) there is evidence of child labour, including during
school hours; and 6) engaging in tobacco farming is a key predictor of having the main
symptoms of green tobacco sickness.




18 // Introduction
The report is structured as follows: it begins with a discussion of the research methods
used to collect the survey data and the focus group discussion data, and the
analytical approaches (Section 2). Section 3 presents and analyzes the characteristics
of the farmers in the survey (current and former tobacco farmers). Section 4 focuses on
the economics of tobacco growing including contracts, production, prices, costs and
profits. The next section, Section 4, examines why tobacco farmers continue to grow
tobacco despite mostly poor returns. Section 4.4 explores farmers’ credit and debt. The
following section,Section 4.5, examines the households’ cultivation of other crops,
particularly in the context of conceptualizing alternative agricultural livelihoods. Then its
followed by a short discussion about child labour (Section 5), farmers’ well-being including
asset accumulation (Section 6), which includes the food security and health status. Sections
7 and 8 contain the report’s concluding remarks and discuss a few recommendations in
light of the results of the study.

    METHODS

    2.1 — Sampling and survey instruments
    The survey sampled 1,350 current and former smallholder tobacco-farming
    households in the major tobacco-growing provinces of East Java, Central Java and
    West Nusa Tenggara.1. As presented in Table 1, within the three provinces, seven major
    tobacco-producing municipalities were purposively sampled as a result of their significant
    tobacco production, based on production data from Tree Crop Estate Statistics, 2014–16
    (Indonesia Ministry of Agriculture 2016). The next stratum was a sample of two to four
                                                  distinction in Indonesia, within each of these
    tobacco-producing villages, a key subdistrict ­
    municipalities. Within each selected village, a random sample of 75 farmers was drawn
                                          ­ armers for 2016 provided with the assistance of the
    from the most recent lists of tobacco f
    village head.2

    The survey instrument was developed based on similar surveys in other countries
    and expanded with significant data collection elements from the World Bank Living
    Standards Measurement Study (LSMS). The final questionnaire was divided into 26
    sections and included the following major topics: household characteristics; livelihood,
    income and assets; land ownership and crop production; tobacco production generally;
    tobacco production under contracts (where applicable); tobacco marketing; farmer debt
    and credit; household food security; and the future of tobacco production and health.
    The survey instrument was influenced by recent survey-based research on the political
    economy of tobacco farming in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Philippines (Briones, 2015;
    Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016; Makoka et
    al., 2016) and the LSMS surveys implemented in many countries. The LSMS is a survey
    program that provides technical assistance to national statistical offices in designing and
    implementing multi-topic household surveys.

    Data collection was conducted in November 2016 to January 2017. The data collection
    team comprised a team of experienced interviewers/enumerators, one research supervisor



    1 To determine the sample size of the survey, we first defined the population size N of tobacco farmers in Indonesia to be ~500,000.
    For the simple random sampling process, we adopted the conservative standard deviation p       ˆ to be 0.5, confidence level as 95%
    (Z=1.96) and allowed the margin of error e to be 4% (Please see online appendix for full details on sample calculation).
    2 On the basis of previous surveys of tobacco farmers in other countries and agricultural surveys in Indonesia, we expected the response
    rate to be between 80% and 90% and sought to reach out to ~1,400 tobacco farmers with a final sample size of 1,350 (96.74%
    response rate). We had no a priori reason to suspect that there were large regional differences, so we chose to implement the survey
    evenly across the selected municipalities; furthermore, we had the luxury of large subsamples in each province.

(V.13.1) statistical package. All activities for this research were approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the Morehouse School of Medicine, the IRB of record for the American
Cancer Society, and the IRB of SurveyMeter in Indonesia.

We also implemented a series of focus group discussions (FGDs) with current and
former tobacco farmers to contextualize the survey results and to inform our
multivariate analyses of the dynamics around tobacco farming. We selected the
villages purposively, choosing major tobacco-growing communities. The FGDs were
conducted in villages in three municipalities: Sugigwaras, Ngraho and Ngasum. In the
village of Alasagung in Sughiwaras, and Nganti in Ngraho, we conducted FGDs with
active tobacco farmers. In the village of Mediunan, we conducted three FGDs: the first
one with current farmers, the second one with former farmers, and the third with the
middlemen who buy tobacco from the tobacco farmers and sell it to the tobacco
processors and/or manufacturers. The participants were chosen by the survey team
supervisor that was responsible in the study area from a list suggested by village leaders
and farmers. The FGDs were fully recorded and transcribed. Analysis of the FGDs
made full use of the transcripts as well as other notes from the FGDs including seating
arrangement and the participation level of each participant.

The analysis consisted of both descriptive and multivariate analyses. The descriptive
analysis aimed to elucidate the breadth and depth of farmers’ general characteristics. The
multivariate analyses aimed to explore causality of selected key relationships.

    FARMERS’ CHARACTERISTICS

    3.1 — Socio-demographic profile
    Overall, the vast majority of tobacco farmers are middle-aged males, usually older
    than the general population and with no more than five years of schooling. In Table 2,
    we present the socio-demographic characteristics of the survey respondents. Households
    for both current and former tobacco farming households were similar at 3.86 and 3.69
    respectively. First, the heads of the tobacco-farming households—the main focus of the
    survey—were overwhelmingly male at 96.5 percent, though as reported below, tobacco
    farming is undoubtedly a family endeavor. The majority of the respondents (63.3%) were
    middle-aged—between 36 and 60 years old. A further 23.3% were older than 60. In a
    country where the average age is approximately 28 years, these results suggest that
    tobacco farmers are significantly older than the average person. Most tobacco farmers in
    the survey were married (>90%). More than three-quarters of farmers reported a Sekolah
    Dasar (SD) education or less, which is the equivalent of 5 years of elementary school (or
    less), suggesting that the farmers did not typically have many years of formal education.
    These findings are similar to those for the agricultural sector from the 2015 National Labor
    Force Survey (Sakernas) though lower than the general population. Finally, four out of five
    households reported agriculture as their main economic activity.

    The overwhelming majority of individuals in tobacco-farming households reported
    participating in tobacco farming as a first or second job in the last 12 months
    (>96%), demonstrating that most household members were contributing to the
    enterprise. In the survey, we asked individuals to name their “First” and “Second”
    occupation without additional qualification (e.g., which job earned the most income?
    Which job required the most hours?, etc.). Table 3 reports the main sources of livelihoods
    for all of the working-age household members, showing that most household members
    were contributing meaningfully to tobacco farming. In the current tobacco-farming
    households, around 83 percent of the household members also reported nontobacco
    agricultural activities as a first or second job. In former tobacco-farming households,
    approximately 96 percent of household members reported agriculture as their first or
    second job. The survey was implemented around tobacco harvest for many households
    and ~60 percent of household members from tobacco farms reported working on the
    farm in the previous week. Nearly 30 percent reported working on the farm without pay.

Note: N in Table 3 is the number of household members.



A little more than a quarter (26.8%) of each of the household members from both
tobacco-farming and nontobacco households reported helping to run a small enterprise
of some kind in the previous week, while nearly the same proportion reported receiving
wages from somebody else’s business enterprise.

Nearly three quarters of tobacco-farming households in the survey were deriving
less than half of their income from tobacco growing. Figure 2 illustrates the household
income from tobacco farming as a proportion of total household income. As Figure 2
shows, one-third of households reported that tobacco farming comprised less than
10 percent of their household income. This means that only a minority of tobacco-farming
households relied on tobacco farming as their major income-earning activity, even
though the survey respondent often reported it as their primary job. In the FGDs, many
farmers described a dynamic in which they planted tobacco most years, understanding
that most of the time it would not generate very much income, but occasionally, when
prices were high and weather was favourable, they could make extra income growing
tobacco. One farmer, when asked about falling prices, responded, “Farmers here must not
have that thought and they keep cultivating tobacco no matter what … In any situation,
no matter what, whether we suffer from loss or get advantage and profit, we keep
cultivating. We are motivated to cultivate. We keep our spirit.”

                           Proportion of tobacco farming income in total household income



On average, former tobacco farming households’ incomes were higher than current
ones, and former tobacco farmers typically generated more income from non-
agricultural enterprises. Former tobacco-farming households on average generated
$3,797.68 in total income, while current farming households generated $2,921.19 (the
average for all farmers in the survey was $3133.22). Note that this was income only and
did not incorporate any costs of farming or other enterprises (addressed below). Table 4
demonstrates the proportion of farmers who drew income from the main sources. Of
former tobacco farmers, 30 percent reported that they were not receiving any agricultural
income. Figure 3 illustrates the major income source categories and amounts from these
sources for both current and former tobacco-farming households. We observe that non-
tobacco (wet) season(s) farmer income from agricultural sources is quite similar (~$370
USD). In the tobacco (dry) season, the former tobacco farming households generate
substantially more income—$262 versus $150—from nontobacco agriculture than the
tobacco-farming households, which is logical considering that they are allocating more
land and resources to nontobacco agriculture than their tobacco-farming peers. Most
notably, former tobacco-farming households’ “enterprise” income from non-agricultural
sources was $639 compared to $412 for tobacco farming households. This difference is
likely due most to the extra time that former farmers have to dedicate to other economic
activities, a dynamic that is discussed below in the labour cost section.

Dependence on agricultural income varies across regions. In order to examine
further the dependence on agriculture for household income, in Figure 4, we plot
regional agricultural (Y-axis) and non-agricultural (X-axis) incomes for both current and
former tobacco-farming households. In the top left quadrant, we observe the most
agricultural income-dependent regions, which include Temanggung and Lombok
Tengah (for both current and former tobacco farmers). In the bottom right quadrant,
we observe the households most dependent on non-agricultural income, including
tobacco farmers in Magelang and Jember. Notably, Jember, Magelang and Temanggung
demonstrated higher average per capita incomes, which means that both the least
and most agriculture-dependent regions were better off in terms of income.


3.2 — Poverty
Poverty among tobacco farmers is widespread. In Indonesia, 8.3 percent of households
fall below the World Bank poverty rate (World Bank, 2016) of $1.90/day (purchasing
power parity), while 11.1 percent fall under the Indonesian government’s poverty line

      (OECD, 2016), which was ~248,000 IDR per month. As presented in Table 5, using a measure
      of household total resources, which does not incorporate any of the farming or other
      business costs, the poverty rate among tobacco farming households is 20.8 percent at
      the World Bank threshold and 32.8 percent at the Indonesian government threshold. If we
      instead use a more realistic measure of household total income, which subtracts all of the
      expenses incurred to farm or to run other household businesses from total resources, the
      poverty rate of tobacco farming households jumps considerably to 69.8 percent at the
      World Bank line and 72.2 percent at the official government line. This jump in the proportion
      of farmers is largely a function of the considerable expense to cultivate tobacco leaf.

      The poverty levels of former tobacco farmers is significantly lower than of current
      tobacco farmers. As illustrated in Table 5, former tobacco farmers seem, at first, to fare
      generally worse in terms of poverty than tobacco farmers using the household resource
      measure (23.8 percent at the World Bank threshold and 36.5 percent at the government
      line). The household resource measure incorporates wage income, revenue from
      agricultural (including sold and consumed) and non-agricultural activities, and other
      non-labor income. But, if we use the more realistic household income measure, the
      proportion of former tobacco-farming households below the poverty thresholds
      (46.2 percent at World Bank and 53.5 percent at the government line) is significantly
      smaller than the proportion below the poverty lines of the households that are continuing

                  to grow tobacco. Again, the difference between current and former tobacco farmers’ poverty
                  rates is due in large part to the higher input costs of farming tobacco compared to other
                  enterprises, both agricultural and non-agricultural. While current tobacco farmers fared
                  slightly better in terms of per capita resources per household than former farmers, former
                  farmers on average had significantly high mean and median per capita incomes.

                  On average, current tobacco farmers used social assistance more than former
                  tobacco farmers. Considering the poverty issues illustrated above, different forms of
                  social assistance are part of the economic reality of many current and former tobacco
                  farming households. In Table 6, we present the results from an analysis of the social pro-
                  tection that current and former tobacco farmers reported receiving. Broadly speaking,
                  only a minority of either group of farmers formally had a Social Security Card (KPS) or a
                  Family Welfare Card (KKS). The most recent Social Assistance Public Expenditure Review

(SAPER) reports that 25% of all Indonesians are eligible for KKS, though this does not
necessarily translate into card distribution/card program coverage.3 Notably, a large number
of farmers complained in the FGDs that social protection was uneven, commonly making
comments such as “some have, but some just don’t,” and “but here it is not spread evenly.”
The largest benefit that both groups of farmers received was “rice for the poor” with
nearly 75 percent of households having received this assistance. This is slightly above the
national average of 70 percent reported in the SAPER.

3 KKS and KPS are distributed to beneficiaries based on the Unified Data Base of indigent households for access to multiple social
assistance programs such as Rice for the Poor and education financial assistance, etc.

A greater proportion of current tobacco farmers than former tobacco farmers utilized
government health benefits (Table 7). The largest observable difference between
current and former tobacco farmers was the proportion who had Indonesia Health Card
(KIS) or National Health Insurance System (BPJS) coverage and used them in the previous
year. For current tobacco farmers with KIS, 15 percent of farmers used it compared to
6.7 percent of former farmers. For BJPS, it was 19.3 percent of current farmers using it in
the last year versus 6.7 percent for former tobacco farmers. Nationally, the enrollment is
approximately 10 percent, though this is higher among informal workers in the agricultural

3.3 — Land Use
There was considerable variation among regions in terms of the size of the total
land owned, cultivated and cultivated specifically for tobacco. Table 8 shows the
average size of owned land for current farmers varied between 0.23 in Magelang to more
than three quarters of a hectare in Lombok Tengah. The proportion of land cultivated for
tobacco specifically also varied significantly. In Lumajang, tobacco farmers on average
cultivated less than half their land for tobacco while in Lombok Timur it was around
two-thirds. Farmers in Magelang owned and cultivated the smallest amounts of land, on
average at approximately 15 percent of a hectare.




34 // Farmers’ Characteristics
The majority of farmers owned their land, though a larger percent of former farmers
(74.5%) owned land compared to current tobacco farmers (63.3%). Table 9 presents
the type of legal entitlement of tobacco-farming households. Since many households
owned more than one separate parcel of land, we use parcel as the unit of analysis. The
next most common land entitlement was rental, with current farmers renting more
(23.7%) compared to former tobacco farmers (14.4%).

    TOBACCO GROWING

    4.1 — Characteristics of tobacco farming: contracts, production
    and prices
    Tobacco farmers in Indonesia grow all the major types of tobacco leaf, though the
    majority grow Virginia leaf. Accordingly, Table 10 reports the categories of tobacco
    farming enterprises by leaf type across the regions of the survey. Virginia is typically more
    input and labour-intensive because it requires flue-curing (with heat and smoke)
    compared to Burley which is air-dried. Farmers indicated that they believe there is a
    stronger market and higher prices for Virginia leaf. In the FGDs, a number of farmers
    indicated that they thought, for example, that the Oriental “leaves were too small” and
    that the “price was not good.” Notably, the results from the survey do not support the
    farmers’ general perception in this regard—Virginia leaf was not consistently more lucrative.

    Though the majority of farmers reported being independent, more than 20 percent
    of farmers noted that they were in a formal or informal contract with some form of
    leaf buyer. In Table 11, we show the distribution of contract and independent farmers by
    region. In all major tobacco growing regions, some tobacco farmers have entered into
    contracts with various types of tobacco leaf buyers. We did not purposively seek out
    contract farmers, so the proportion, 21.7 percent, is from the survey’s random sample
    only. Typically, these farmers receive their physical inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides

from the leaf buyer without paying cash for them, but the farmer must sell their leaf to the
buyer at a price dictated by the buyer, and the costs of the inputs are deducted from the sales.

We use multivariate analysis to examine farmers’ decisions to enter into a contract
with a leaf buyer. Using a dichotomous measure of contract (1) or no contract (0) as the
dependent variables and a set of independent variables drawn from previous literature
examining tobacco contract farming (Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al.,
2016; Makoka et al., 2016), machine-learning methods and stepwise regression. Results of
the final regression model are presented in Table 12.4 The regression results suggest that
farmers paying more for hired labour were more likely to enter into a contract as were
farmers who paid more for their input costs broadly reported, and also farmers who spent
more on nontobacco crop inputs (no labour). Burley and Oriental farmers are far more
likely to enter into a contract; in fact, most Burley and Oriental leaf farmers were on contract.
Because some farmers did not provide answers to certain queries (including sales, type
of tobacco, and land entitlement), we imputed values for these variables, and re-ran the
analyses, finding that households that had more household tobacco-related labour costs
were more likely to be in a contract, as were more experienced tobacco farmers. Older
tobacco farmers were slightly less likely to enter into a contract to grow tobacco.

The sales and prices of tobacco leaf varied across regions. Table 13 reports on median
tobacco production, price and income by surveyed region. There was considerable
variation across regions with median volume lowest in Bojonegoro (200 kg) and highest in
Lombok Tengah (1,400 kg). Average prices were highest in the two regions of Lombok, and
Lumajang ($1.87/kg), and lowest in Bojonegoro ($0.45/kg). Median total household tobacco

sales were lowest in Bojonegoro ($29.99) and highest again in the two Lombok regions
(>$400). It is not clear why this wide variation exists, but the results suggest for example that
farmers in Lombok Tengah farm quite intensively with more hired labor and greater
quantities of key inputs such as fertilizer. It is also possible that the type of leaf cultivated
affects overall productivity. Deeper explanations of productivity, however, would require
more research designed more specific to agricultural productivity in tobacco cultivation.

production, price and total sales by leaf type. While there was variation in the median
volume sold across leaf type (ranging from 130 kg for Oriental and 370 kg for Virginia),
notably, there was much less variation on price and total sales. Virginia fetched the lowest
median price at $1.50/kg while the other two varietals earned farmers $1.87/kg. Median
sales ranged from $124.28 for Virginia to $149.96 for Oriental. These low sales numbers
in many cases are likely linked to the finding from Figure 2 that for many households,
tobacco farming is not the primary income earner.

The price of tobacco varied by leaf type and the quality of the leaf. In Indonesia, the
leaf buyer sets both the price and the quality grade; farmers have little or no agency over
either price or grade, and the government does not interfere in either process. In Table
15, we report the average price for the different major leaf types and the quality grades
within each type. Grade A Burley fetched the highest price at $2.44/kg while the Grade D
Virgina fetched the lowest price at $1.12/kg. Notably, the average price of Burley across all
grades is roughly the same median price reported by farmers in Kenya (Magati et al., 2016),
the Philippines (Chavez et al., 2016) and Zambia (Goma et al., 2015), suggesting that prices
for tobacco leaf are, in large part, global. The actual tobacco comprises approximately
1.5% of the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes. In the FGDs, farmers consistently reported
that the middlemen—the most common buyer—determined the price and it was non-­
negotiable. When asked about questioning the buyer’s evaluation of the quality, one
farmer repeated, “The middlemen determines the price.”

Tobacco farmers sell their leaf to a variety of buyers. In Table 16, we report on who
the buyers of the farmers’ tobacco leaf were. Because most farmers sell their leaf more
than once in a growing season and not always to the same buyer, the unit of analysis is
each discrete sale of tobacco leaf, which is the reason why the number of cases is
significantly more than the number of tobacco-growing households. By far the largest



5 Taking an American blend in a 0.7 gram Marlboro stick as an example: 50% Virginia + 35–40% of Burley + 10–15% of Oriental = (1.5 *
0.5 + 1.87 * 0.5) * 0.0007 = 0.00118 for the tobacco cost of one stick, or 0.02359 for a pack of 20.0.02359/1.537 = 1.535% (Marlboro price
from Euromonitor data 2016, exchange rate from EIU).

                  of surveyed households.


                  type of buyer was a “middleman”—more than two-thirds of tobacco sale actions were
                  to middlemen. Some of the middlemen also appear to be part of another tobacco leaf
                  sub-sector as there appear to be many warehouses where some treatment, including
                  curing, of the tobacco leaf takes place. The next largest type of buyer was the cigarette
                  company warehouse at 13.9 percent, while another 7.7 percent was reported by these
                  farmers to be the cigarette company directly (but not the warehouse).

                  typically very high in Indonesia, particularly compared to most other crops (e.g,

2016; Makoka et al., 2016; Mulyana, 2015). The evidence for Indonesia is consistent with
these broader findings. In Table 17, we examine tobacco farmers’ main non-labour input
costs to grow tobacco leaf. The mean input cost was $255.55 and the median was $86.05.
Fertilizers were the most common and one of the consistently largest expenses. Nearly all
tobacco farmers (98.5%) reported purchasing non-organic fertilizers, while another 38%
reported buying organic fertilizers. The average cost for those purchasing inorganic
fertilizer was $37.49, and $22.49 for organic fertilizer. Rental of equipment was another
common (~41%) and significant input cost reported by many households, on average
$29.99. The single highest average cost was $224.94 for firewood, though only 10% of
farmers reported purchasing this input. Firewood is sometimes used in Indonesia to cure
Virginia tobacco leaf and only some households cure their own tobacco in this way. Most
farmers reported curing their tobacco leaf by sun and air.

Farmers typically use significantly fewer inputs for nontobacco crops during the
tobacco-growing season. It is important to consider that many tobacco farmers even
during the tobacco season are also growing nontobacco crops. Table 18 illustrates the
main inputs that tobacco farmers reported for nontobacco crops grown during both the

                tobacco-growing (dry) and nontobacco (wet) seasons and the average costs of these
                inputs. The mean input cost was $60.72 and the median was $25.86. The most common
                inputs were non-organic fertilizer (59% of farmers) and pesticides (43%). Non-organic
                fertilizer was one the highest average input costs for tobacco farmers’ nontobacco crops
                at $15.63. Equipment rental ($16.87) was another significant cost, but only ~20% of farmers
                reported renting equipment. Moreover, average costs for both were significantly less than
                what tobacco farmers typically spend on these two inputs for their tobacco crops. In the
                second set of columns for the wetter seasons, we observe that these costs look closer
                to the tobacco-growing costs with significant average input costs, for example, for both
                types of fertilizer. These data suggest that many tobacco farmers are allocating inputs away
                from nontobacco crops toward their tobacco crops during the tobacco-growing season.

Former tobacco farmers typically use fertilizer less intensively than their tobacco-
farming counterparts. In Table 19, we report former tobacco farmers’ principal inputs
during the season in which current tobacco farmers were growing tobacco. The average
input cost was $177.25 and the median was $63.36. Approximately 9 out of 10 former
tobacco farmers reported using non-organic fertilizers at an average cost of $30.74, which
is less than their tobacco-farming counterparts. Roughly the same proportion of former
tobacco farmers were renting equipment and spending similar amounts compared to
their tobacco-growing peers.

Beyond obvious physical inputs, there are other direct costs associated with farming,
including depreciation of equipment used for farming, interest costs from loans, rent
for land, and in the case of tobacco, government levies collected by the leaf buyers.

            In Table 20, we present these costs by region. For depreciation, we use the accounting
            discipline’s straightline method.6 We observe fairly consistent median costs across regions
            with the cost of interest being typically the highest. Farmers in Lombok Tengah appeared
            to take out the largest loans to farm tobacco on average, while farmers in Lombok Timur
            rented more land to cultivate tobacco leaf. Farmers in Lombok Timur also tended to pay
            considerably more rent to grow other crops than tobacco.



            6 Straight-line depreciation = (purchase price of asset – approximate salvage value)/estimated useful life of asset.

  Farmers’ perceptions of input costs are largely different from the actual costs, with
  the exception of the most experienced farmers. Each season, farmers must make
  a calculation as to the difference between the total estimated cost of inputs to grow
  tobacco (or any crop) versus expected revenue from selling the crop. In the survey, before
  enumerating each cost systematically, we asked each respondent to estimate how much

 they thought their total tobacco-related input costs were for that season. We examine
 the difference between these estimates and the actual total of their costs and plot it in
 Figure 5 by years of experience. We observe that only very experienced farmers (more
 than 30 years) were actually close in their estimates. We use the logged value of the
 inputs because the estimates were actually quite divergent for some of the farmers (i.e.,
 their actual costs were in reality far higher than estimated costs when they were asked to
 systematically itemize all of their expenses). These findings suggest that many farmers are
 likely making cropping decisions based on considerable underestimation of their costs.
 Figure 6 is a similar figure for farmers with an elementary education or less and the graph
 suggests that these farmers learn over time and make better cost estimations as they
 become very experienced. This dynamic appears to be driven by Bojonegoro, Jember and
 Magelang where the evidence for this learning was statistically strongest.

 Median tobacco input costs for tobacco farmers vary considerably across regions
 and more than their nontobacco input costs (in both wet and dry seasons). In Figure 7,
 we compare tobacco farmers’ non-labour median input costs among regions for both dry

 (tobacco and nontobacco) and wet seasons. We observe the most variation in median
 non-labour input costs across regions for the actual tobacco growing. Lombok Tengah
 and Temanggung both break the $200 (USD) threshold, while Bojonegoro had the lowest
 median input cost for tobacco farming at $25.31. There was much less variation across
 regions for nontobacco farming input costs during the dry (tobacco) season. The range
 was $16.68 to $61.48. For wet season farming for tobacco farmers, there was not large
 variation on median input costs with the exception of Temanggung, which was $203.19.
 The next highest median input cost during the wet season was Lumajang at $80.90.

 Former farmers’ input costs varied among regions but there was less variation than
 with current tobacco farmers. In Figure 8, we examine the median input costs for former
 tobacco farmers in both dry and wet seasons. We observe some variation among regions
 during the dry season, ranging from $22.49 in Bojonegoro to $167.35 in Temanggung, though
 the latter had significantly higher costs than the region with the second highest median
 costs (Lumajang at $97.47). There was less variation among regions for median input costs
 during the wet seasons with a range of $33.57 in Magelang to $115.69 in Lumajang.

 Tobacco farming is highly labour-intensive in Indonesia. Tobacco farming has a wide
 reputation for being labour intensive, and research in other countries supports that

       reputation (e.g., Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al.,
       2016). The results from this survey presented in Table 21 suggest the same in Indonesia.
       For example, as reported in Table 21, the median male individual in a household worked
       600 hours on tobacco cultivation in the tobacco-growing season, while the median
       female individual worked 360 hours. It is critical to note that these individuals also worked
       on nontobacco crops in the same season. The median male dedicates 240 hours to non­
       tobacco crops while the median female spends 147 on other crops. In contrast, the median
       former tobacco farmer dedicates far less time to her/his crops. The median male spends 360
       hours on cultivating his crops in the dry season while the median female spends 180 hours.

       Most households hire non-household workers to assist with tobacco cultivation.
       Farmers also hire labour, adult and child, to work at agricultural tasks. Figure 9 illustrates
       that hired labourers – men, women and children – are used for most major agricultural
       activities on tobacco farms. For example, the mean household hires men for more than
       11 days to tend the tobacco fields and women for more than 8 days (labourers are typically
       hired by the day, not the hour, which is why the unit of analysis is different than for
       household labour; in FGDs, farmers reported that average days were around 10 hours).

       Current tobacco farmers typically allocated far more labour—household and
       hired—to cultivation of crops than former tobacco farmers. For many years, even
       though tobacco farming is a labour-intensive crop, researchers have rarely addressed
       the issue of the value of labour inputs in studies of tobacco farming, let alone incorporated
       them into the calculation of farmers’ costs. But in Indonesia’s increasingly dynamic economy,
       many tobacco farmers have other economic opportunities and, therefore, it is important
       to conceptualize that there are opportunity costs to farming tobacco. In other words, time
       spent cultivating tobacco is time that could be spent on other potentially more profitable

economic endeavors. More recent studies have begun to address this issue by assigning
defensible values based on local agricultural wage rates to this household labour (e.g.,
Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016). Following
their methodologies, we calculated an hourly rate using official regional agricultural
minimum wages and official workweeks (some regions had more hours in a workweek)
and multiplied by the number of household labour hours reported. In other words, these
individuals at a minimum could have found casual work laboring on other tobacco
farms; realistically, many of these farmers were very experienced and could have earned
more than a typical day labourer so these estimations are very conservative. In Table 22,
we compare current and former tobacco farmers’ household and hired labour for the
tobacco-growing (dry) season. For the current tobacco farmers, we also break down the
value of labour between their tobacco and nontobacco crops. Clearly, tobacco farmers
are investing an enormous amount of resources into both household and hired labour
across all regions. In most regions, the amount of tobacco farmers’ labour dedicated to
tobacco was more than the former tobacco farmers were dedicating to their crops, but
on top of that, the current tobacco farmers were allocating nearly as many hours to their
nontobacco crops.

4.3 — Profits
Tobacco farmers’ perceived profits (“gross margins”) from tobacco are close to zero,
while realized profits (which incorporate value of household labour) are negative;
former tobacco farmers’ profits are also negative but generally higher than current
tobacco farmers’. Recent tobacco farming research in other countries suggests that
tobacco farming is not very profitable for most smallholder farmers (e.g., Chavez et al.,
2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016). Accordingly, to examine
the profit dynamic in Indonesia, we used the information presented above on revenue
and costs to calculate the profits of the tobacco farmers. We first examine per hectare
profits with the important qualification that most farmers have small plots of land. In
other words, some of the numbers will seem to be of a large (usually negative magnitude),
but readers should take into account that the vast majority of households cultivate only
part of a hectare, often a small proportion. In Table 24, we present both median “perceived”
profits per hectare, which are what agricultural economists would term “gross margins” a
straightforward calculation of the revenues from selling crops less the direct non-labour
expenses including physical inputs (e.g., fertilizer and pesticide), hired labour, marketing
expenses and transportation. We observe that for current tobacco farmers, the median
perceived profit from growing tobacco is $2.67 per hectare. “Realized” profits per hectare
incorporate the minimum valuation of household labour presented above. The median
realized profit per hectare for tobacco farming was –$3542.85. We also compared the
nontobacco crops for both current and former tobacco farmers. For the current tobacco
farmers, their median perceived profit for their nontobacco crops was $695.87/hectare
while the median realized profit with labour included was –$1245.80. For former tobacco
farmers, the median perceived profit was $451.37 while the median realized profit was
–$356.71. These results suggest that the median former tobacco farmer is doing considerably
better than the median tobacco farmer in his/her agricultural pursuits.

Most tobacco farmers are not turning a profit. In Figure 10, we examine the distribution
of perceived and real profits. We observe that the tobacco farmer had negative perceived
profits though there were clearly households with positive perceived profits. In contrast,
there were far fewer households that demonstrated positive real profits.

There was variation in median profits across regions, driven largely by variation
in hours allocated by household labour to cultivation. In Table 25, we examine the
median profits per hectare for current tobacco farmers for both their tobacco and non-
tobacco crops by region. We observe that there is considerable variation among regions.
The wide variation in the real profits is best explained by the wide variation across regions
in the number of hours reported by household members to cultivate tobacco leaf.

In profitability, independent tobacco farmers generally fared better than contract
farmers. In Table 26, we compare the median profits per hectare for contract versus
independent farmer by district. In brief, per hectare profits varied widely, but in most
districts, independent farms fared better on profits compared to their contracting neighbors.
In terms of perceived profit for the independent farmers, there was wide variation,
ranging from $1212.13 median profit per hectare in Lumajang to a loss of $476 per hectare
in Jember. For contract farmers, only the farmers in Magelang had a positive perceived
profit. The realized profits across all regions and both types of farmers varied considerably,

but were all negative. The median real profit for contract farmers in Lombok Timur was
closest to breaking even at $–823.75. Both contract and independent farmers appeared
to fare the worst.

Profits per kilogram (perceived and realized) for tobacco leaf were also negative for
almost all regions. Because many tobacco farmers cultivated small plots of land—often
a small fraction of a hectare—it can be challenging to put the per hectare profits into a
meaningful perspective for the average household. Accordingly, we also calculated per

kilogram profits for both tobacco and as a point of comparison for nontobacco crops,
which are presented in Table 27. The per kilogram perceived and realized profits for
tobacco were negative for all regions except perceived profit in Bojonegoro. The perceived
per kilogram profits for nontobacco crops were positive for all regions, though no region
demonstrated realized per kilogram profits for nontobacco crops.

There was wide variation in profit per kilogram for tobacco farming. In Figure 11, we
present the distribution of the real and perceived profits per kilogram for both tobacco
and nontobacco crops for current tobacco farmers. We find a wide distribution particularly
among the real profits per kilogram for tobacco farming.

Perceived profits per kilogram were mostly positive for former tobacco farmers,
while realized profits were negative. In Table 28, we present the median profits per
kilogram for former tobacco farmers. With the caveat that this is a somewhat crude
measure because the prices by weight of different crops vary tremendously, sometimes as
a function of other variables such as how much water is in the crop (e.g., garlic versus
tomatoes), there is nevertheless some interesting information to consider. First, the
median perceived profits per kilogram are positive or close to positive in most regions.
For the median realized profits, they are negative in all regions. However, the losses are
typically much smaller in magnitude than for the current tobacco farmers’ nontobacco
crops as we observe above in Table 27.

 The distribution of profits per kilogram was much tighter for former tobacco farmers
 than current ones. In Figure 12, we present the distribution of the real and perceived
 profits per kilogram for former tobacco farmers. We find a tighter distribution particularly
 among the perceived profits per kilogram compared to the tobacco farming profits
 distribution above in Figure 11.

 Most tobacco farmers allocated a far greater proportion of their expenses toward
 cultivating their tobacco crops compared to the proportion of their revenues from
 selling tobacco leaf. In order to understand better how farmers allocated their expenses
 compared to their sales, we plotted the proportion of total agricultural costs (nonlabour
 and labour) that were spent on tobacco farming (X axis) with the tobacco proportion of
 total household agricultural revenue (Y axis) in Figure 13. We observe that a majority of
 farmers were misallocating their expenses toward tobacco farming — in other words, the
 proportion of total farming expenses for tobacco for most households was much higher
 than tobacco’s share of total agricultural revenues.

 The size of a farmer’s tobacco crop is negatively related to their income. We also ran
 multivariate analyses to predict farmers’ income. Building on Klasen et al. (2013) work on
 cash crop choices in Indonesia, we utilized the following model: Income = (tobacco) +
 (agricultural self-employment) + (agricultural wage) + (nonagricultural self-employment)
 + (nonagricultural wage) + demographic characteristics. For the sake of space, we present
 only the significant findings in Table 29 (complete findings are available upon request).
 One of the most significant findings was that the size of the area planted for tobacco
 was a strong negative predictor of farmer income. Notably, other agricultural variables
 including total area cultivated for crops and agricultural self-employment (i.e., not under
 contract) were positive predictors of income. Household size was negatively related to
 income and wage employment was positively related.

4.4 — Credit and Debt
The majority of tobacco farmers reported the need for loans to cultivate tobacco.
Because farmers typically need inputs to begin the cultivation process and most Indonesian
farmers do not have large savings, access to credit is an important financial need for
many households. Tobacco farming is particularly input-intensive, and this dynamic likely
heightens the need for credit to obtain these inputs. In fact, 52.7 percent of tobacco
farmers reported needing credit, which was statistically significantly more than former
tobacco farmers. Not surprisingly, 50 percent of tobacco farmers applied for a loan, which
was more than the 42.9 percent of former tobacco farmers (p<0.05). Most of the tobacco
farmers (~97%) were able to obtain the loans for which they applied. Farmers reported
needing loans for many reasons beyond inputs though it was the modal reason for
tobacco farmers, as reported in Table 30. However, simply meeting daily needs and paying
for education were also major reasons that farmers identified.

4.5 — Other Crop Growing
Though both former and current tobacco farmers grew a wide variety of crops to sell,
former tobacco farmers grew a far wider variety. In Table 31, to better understand
differences in cropping decisions, we compare the proportion of former farmers growing
common, locally-grown, nontobacco crops in order to sell with the proportion of current
tobacco farmers growing these crops to sell. There is a very clear pattern that in both
the dry and wet seasons, the former farmers cultivate a much broader range of crops to
sell. The red font indicates the crops where a greater proportion of former farmers are
growing the specific crop. For example, 100 percent of former tobacco farmers report
growing sweet potato in the dry season to sell, while only 12.5% of current farmers report
growing sweet potato to sell. Similarly, all of the former farmers reported growing non-                Note: Red font
                                                                                                        indicates where a

reported growing these crops. One major exception to this pattern was paddy (rice)                      are growing that

     Former tobacco farmers are growing and selling common, local crops. In Table 32,
     we compare sales (in USD) of nontobacco crops between current and former tobacco
     farmers. While there is considerable variation across the surveyed regions, in each one,
     there are several crops that former tobacco farmers are selling significantly more than current
     tobacco farmers. For example, former tobacco farmers in Jember are selling significantly
     more corn and chili in the dry season than their tobacco-growing peers. In other words,
     they are choosing to grow more of commonly-grown, local crops and selling them
     instead of growing tobacco. Thus, there is little need to imagine a new “alternative” crop
     to which tobacco farmers could switch, but rather, current farmers can do what former
     tobacco farmers are already doing by identifying local crops that grow well, cultivating
     and selling them for profit. As discussed above, on average, these former tobacco farmers are
     doing better economically than their tobacco-growing neighbors. Their strategy appears
     simple: grow what you know how to grow. The evidence suggests that the strategy
     appears to be a successful one for many of these farming households.

     Former tobacco farmers switched to other crops for a variety of reasons including
     low prices, bad weather and more attractive alternatives. The main reasons (see
     Figure 14) that tobacco farmers provided for switching away from tobacco leaf were
     typically economic. Low prices and more attractive alternatives were two of the top three
     explanations. The other major explanation was weather; in the year of data collection, the
     rainy season had been unseasonably long in several of the survey areas and some FGD
     participants also reported that the rains had affected their cropping decisions. These
     findings raise doubts about the durability of switching—it is clear that many tobacco
     farmers are making calculated decisions based mainly on potential economic returns.

Tobacco farmers who farm other crops are more willing to switch completely
away from tobacco. As evidenced by the large number of former tobacco farmers in
this survey, the prospect of switching from tobacco to other crops is a very realistic one.
Accordingly, we examine the determinants of current farmers’ willingness to switch to
alternative crops, presented in Table 33. The dependent variable is a dichotomous indication
by the tobacco farmers that they have ever considered switching or are in the process
of switching (value of 1) versus having never considered switching (value of 0). The
independent variables are drawn from both previous literature (e.g., Chavez et al., 2016;
Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016) and using machine-learning
methods and stepwise regression. For the sake of simplicity and space, we show only the
statistically significant independent variables in Table 33; however, the full results of all
of the underlying analyses and the fully-specified regression are available in the supple-
mentary appendices (available upon request). The odds ratio for the cost of household
labour dedicated to tobacco farming suggests that households that allocate less time to
tobacco farming are more willing to switch. In a related finding, the odds ratio for labour
costs allocated toward nontobacco costs suggest that farmers who allocate more time
to nontobacco products are more likely to be willing to switch. Farmers in Jember were
also much more likely to be willing to switch. This is a region where there is widespread
existing crop switching behaviours away from tobacco to other crops, so this is a reasonable
finding as tobacco farmers observe their neighbours making other cropping decisions
beyond tobacco. Because some survey respondents did not answer the questions about
how much they sold in order to use the full sample, we also imputed values using the
“hot-deck, nearest-neighbor” method (Andridge and Little 2010) and re-ran the analyses.
The results using the imputed dataset revealed several other statistically significant
coefficients. Older farmers were less likely to be willing to switch as were Burley farmers.
In contrast, contract farmers were much more likely to be willing to switch. Farmers who
had reported recent sickness were also more likely to be willing to switch.

For most former tobacco farmers the switch to alternative crops is not yet a durable
one. The survey asked if former farmers saw themselves switching back to tobacco. While only
16.51% saw themselves very likely switching back, 60.63% indicated that they might switch
back to tobacco. Nearly one fifth (18.41%) regard a switch back to tobacco as impossible and
4.44% declared it “very impossible.”


4.6 — Why Farmers Continue to Grow Tobacco
The two main reasons that farmers reported for growing tobacco were (perceived)
profitability and cash generation. Despite strong evidence of poor prospects for
profitable tobacco farming, several hundred thousand tobacco farmers continue to
cultivate tobacco leaf in Indonesia. This dynamic begs an important question: why continue
to grow tobacco? Accordingly, in Figure 15, we examine the reasons that farmers

                     identified for growing tobacco. Farmers were asked to answer yes or no to each of the
                     common reasons from the relevant literature (Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati
                     et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016) and were also given the opportunity to identify their own
                     additional reasons. The numbers represent the percentage of farmers who identified that
                     particular reason (thus the numbers do not sum to the number of respondents). The most
                     common reason was that farmers believed that tobacco farming is profitable (73.6%) and/or is
                     the only crop that can generate money (58%). These responses were fairly consistent among
                     independent and contract farmers, too (supplementary appendices have breakdown and
                     are available upon request). In the focus group discussions, farmers consistently raised the
                     possibility that good weather would lead to good quality, which would in turn lead to higher
                     prices and increased profitability. However, this is at odds with the evidence presented in
                     Section 4.3, which unequivocally shows that most tobacco farmers are not turning a profit.

    CHILD LABOUR
    Existing research presents evidence of child labour in the Indonesian agricultural
    sector. Indonesia has experienced recent challenges around the issue of child labour in
    the agricultural sector. The International Labour Organization (ILO) recently estimated
    that up to 1.5 million children, aged 10–17, work on Indonesian farms (ILO, 2017). Human
    Rights Watch also recently examined this dynamic in the tobacco sector and found that
    children working on farms, often at the expense of their education, was widespread
    (HRW, 2016). Considering the importance of this issue, we asked respondents in the survey
    to enumerate each household member’s contribution to tobacco farming, including
    children. Recognizing that child labour is especially prone to under-reporting as a result
    of the social stigma of exploiting children and because children contribute to casual work
    on farms to a certain extent in most countries, we sought to determine if children were
    working on a consistent basis during school hours; in other words determining if agricultural
    work was replacing education.

    There is evidence that it was more common for children to work cultivating
    tobacco than other crops. In Table 34, in the columns under “# Total Cases—Help of
    Children,” we report any time a respondent indicated that a household child under 15
    (the typical age of adulthood in Indonesia) had worked at a tobacco farming activity. In
    the second set of columns, we report the number of times that a household (i.e., non-
    hired) child was reported working more than eight days that month during official school
    hours at each activity. We were able to cross-reference working and school attendance
    because the survey asked when the child attended school—morning or afternoon—and
    then asked the precise times when each individual in the household worked at tobacco
    farming tasks. We also asked similar questions for nontobacco farming activities. We found
    that a report of a child working on tobacco cultivation was generally rare at less than
    4 percent for even the most common farming activities, field tending and postharvest
    work. For children working consistently during school hours, it was also rare at less than
    2% for field tending and postharvest activities. We did find, however, that children working
    at tobacco farming activities both generally and during school hours was more common
    than children working in other crop cultivation. The final section of the table is children
    working on any crop; the reason that the tobacco and nontobacco sections do not sum
    to the “all” is that some children were working on tobacco and nontobacco crops. Finally,
    it is important to reinforce that this was not a focus of the survey and child labour is a very
    difficult phenomenon to measure in a survey of this nature.

    WELL-BEING

    6.1 — Asset Accumulation
    Former tobacco farmers have significantly higher assets than current tobacco farmers.
    Some development experts identify asset accumulation as an important component of
    economic development. Under certain conditions, these assets can partially form the
    basis of a household’s economic security and/or contribute to other economic activities.
    They may also reflect the permanent income status of households, which can be a better
    and longer term indicator of economic well-being. For example, for farmers having a
    vehicle to transport goods and/or having a mobile phone to monitor market prices helps
    make these households more prosperous. Accordingly, in Table 35, we examine current
    and former tobacco farmers’ household and agricultural assets. The most commonly held
    assets were televisions, gas cylinders for cooking, mobile/cell phones and motorcycles.
    The most valuable assets were cars and large livestock, though in both cases ownership
    of such assets was rare (~7 and 25 percent respectively). A two-sample test demonstrates
    that former tobacco farmers have significantly higher assets than their peers who
    continue to grow tobacco. Comparing to a broader population, the most recent Indonesian
    Family Life Survey (IFLS, 2016) reports that 41 percent of agricultural households more
    generally indicated having larger livestock.


    6.2 — Food Security
    Most households grew some of their own food though less than half of these food-
    producing households grew enough to feed the household for the entire year.
    Research has suggested that tobacco cultivation may be related—negatively—to food
    security (Eriksen et al., 2015; Khisa, 2011). The results from this survey suggest that the
    dynamic of food security among tobacco farmers is complex (Table 36). Rice is the staple
    food in most of Indonesia, although in a handful of regions, corn is also a staple crop.
    Three quarters of tobacco-farming households reported growing their own food. A
    greater percentage of current tobacco-growing households grew their own staple food
    compared to former tobacco farming households. Of these households, approximately
    40 percent reported growing enough food for the entire year. Again, tobacco-growing
    households that grew the staple crop typically grew more than former tobacco-farming
    households (p < 0.01). For the remaining households, they either purchased their food on
    the market or used a combination of cultivating their own food and buying the remainder.

        Farmers that do not grow their own food typically purchase it in the market. In
        Table 37, we present the results of a survey question asking nonfood-growing farmers
        how they acquire their staple food. Nearly all of these farmers reported buying the staple
        food in the market.

        The majority of survey respondents reported that they did not have sufficient food
        to feed their household. In Table 38, we examine households’ perceptions of their food
        security and in particular whether they thought their household had sufficient food. There
        was considerable variation with Bojonegoro and Jember having the highest proportion
        of households reporting that they always had sufficient food at around 40 percent and

the highest level of average food security. Lombok Tengah had the lowest rate of “has
sufficient food” at 20 percent and together with Lombok Timur, the lowest average rates
of food security. Notably, we did not find any statistically significant differences between
current and former tobacco-growing households. Referring back to the section on social
protection (Table 6), many tobacco-farming households relied in part on “rice for the
poor” programs to feed their families at different points in the year.

Farmers with owned their land and/or those who grew more tobacco were more
likely to be food secure. To examine the dynamics around food security, we examined
in multivariate analyses the determinants of household food security. Similar to the other
multivariate analyses, we used previous literature (e.g., Khisa, 2011, Mulyana, 2015) and
machine-learning methods and stepwise regression to identify the relevant independent
variables from the survey results. In Table 39, we report only the statistically significant
coefficients, though all of the foundational analyses are available by request in the
supplementary appendices. We found that tobacco farmers who own their land are more
likely to be food secure as were those who sold more tobacco. This finding might seem
counterintuitive but it actually highlights the complexity of the idea of food security. It is
not merely what farmers grow, but just as importantly, the income that tobacco and/or
other business enterprises can generate to purchase food. The odds ratios also suggest
that farmers who considered switching were less likely to be food secure as were house-
holds that allocated less labour to tobacco farming. In the imputed models, we find that
farmers who grow Oriental leaf are more likely to be food secure while those who grow
Burley leaf are less likely to be food secure. Additionally, two regions, Jember and Lombok
Tengah, were less likely to be food secure. The Jember finding is particularly interesting in
light of its higher average food security score, which suggests that there is considerable
inequality in the region.

                      Regardless of other variables, most rice-growing households grew the same
                      amount of rice. To examine the complexities of growing cash crops versus food crops,
                      in a three-dimensional probability function, we plotted the number of households with
                      total household resources and the quantity of rice produced (Figure 16). The high peak
                      suggests that most households, regardless of the total resources, grew around the same
                      amount of rice. We speculate that farmers grow rice to hedge against the volatility of the
                      market for the agricultural goods that they want to sell (e.g., tobacco), but the results confirm
                      that most farmers are not attempting to feed their households with their own food
                      production alone. More research is necessary on food security and tobacco farming.

                      Regardless of other variables, tobacco farmers tend to grow around the same
                      amount of non-staple food crops. In Figure 16, in a related p.d.f. to examine all food
                      crops instead of just rice, we plot the number of farmers, total household resources and
                      all food crops. We find again that most farmers produce roughly around the same amount
                      of non-staple food crops, reinforcing the notion that most farmers are relying in considerable
                      part on their tobacco cash crop to be able to buy food for the household.

6.3 — Health Status
Working-aged male tobacco farmers were more likely to report recent sickness
than their nontobacco-farming counterparts. There is considerable discussion in the
tobacco-focused public health literature about the dangers of green tobacco sickness
(GTS) generally (e.g., Hipke, 1993; McBride et al., 1998) and specific to Indonesia (Rokmah,
2015; Suprapto, 2005). Handling tobacco without protection—such as rubber gloves—
causes the absorption of nicotine, a known toxin, through the skin and other membranes.
As a result, tobacco farmers who do not wear protective gear when handling tobacco
leaves frequently report the symptoms of nicotine poisoning (or GTS). In Table 40, we first
present the proportion of current and former tobacco growers by gender and age who
reported being sick in the previous 30 days. More than 30 percent of tobacco farmers
between ages 36–60 reported being sick in the previous 30 days while nearly 40 percent of
women over 60 who farmed tobacco reported being sick. We found that a greater proportion
of male current tobacco farmers between the ages of 36–60 (the largest labour pool) had
GTS symptoms compared to the same age group of male former tobacco farmers (p < 0.01).
Similarly a larger proportion of female current tobacco farmers demonstrated more GTS
symptoms than their former tobacco farming peers (p < 0.01).

Older tobacco farmers were more likely to report the main symptoms of green
tobacco sickness. In Figure 17, we examine reports of the symptoms of GTS. We find
that a sizable proportion of older farmers report the main symptoms of GTS. More than
20 percent of tobacco farmers older than 60 reported the main GTS symptoms. For male
tobacco farmers between 36 and 60, it was 17.4 percent and for female tobacco farmers
in the same age category it was 21.2 percent.

Tobacco farming is the largest predictor of having major symptoms of green
tobacco sickness. In Table 41, we report the results of a log regression predicting
individuals reporting major symptoms of GTS, using the sample that includes both former
and current tobacco farmers. In particular, the dependent variable is the respondents’
reporting of 1–4 symptoms of GTS (stiffness, weariness, pain, or soreness in certain parts
of the body; tiredness or weakness are not included as symptoms). Working from
existing literature that examines GTS, we included tobacco farming, age, cost of pesticide
(as a proxy for magnitude of pesticide use) and the number of hours worked. We found
that the largest predictor of GTS symptoms was tobacco farming. Age was also statistically
significant: older farmers were more likely to report major GTS symptoms.

    LIMITATIONS
    Logistical considerations posed very small limitations to the study. As one might
    reasonably expect, the quality of available data used for sampling varied among
    kabupaten. For example, the survey team found errors such as when a row of data for a
    kecamatan was simply copied and pasted from another kecamatan. In the field, the team
    found that some high-producing villages had few former farmers, and the team had to
    visit several dusun (sub-villages) to find a larger sample of former farmers. In contrast, in other
    villages that had started growing less tobacco, it was necessary to visit several dusun in
    order to find a sufficient number of farmers. Finally, the team sometimes encountered
    local names of tobacco varieties that were not easily categorized, which made it challenging
    to ensure a sample that represented the most common tobacco grown in the district.

    The study is cross-sectional. It is possible that this snapshot in time was different than
    other time periods and does not represent general trends completely accurately. However,
    the dozens of farmers in the FGDs indicated that the survey year was a typical one and
    not one farmer raised any concern that there was anything exceptional about the time
    period except for a few who suggested that it had been a somewhat longer than normal
    rainy season. The study team has secured resources to re-survey farmers in the coming
    years to generate a longitudinal panel of current and former tobacco farmers.

    The study only considers current and former farmers in tobacco-growing regions.
    Ideally, we would have utilized a control group who were never tobacco farmers and lived
    in a nontobacco-growing region. The difference in profitability of such farmers with current
    tobacco farmers would represent the difference attributable to both tobacco cultivation
    and the regional externalities arising from tobacco cultivation. The current estimate of
    the difference in profitability between current and former tobacco farmers likely under-
    estimates it. Due to limited resource, the sample was drawn purposively from clustered
    tobacco cultivating regions. It was not possible to cover tobacco farmers who never grew
    tobacco from nontobacco growing areas.

    The study mainly considered only nontobacco crop cultivation as an alternative
    livelihood. Another potential limitation is the study considered only nontobacco crop
    cultivation as alternative livelihood option. It did not explore the possibilities of nonfarm
    economic activities (e.g., petty trade and businesses).

    CONCLUSION
    The results of this survey shed considerable light on the livelihoods of tobacco
    farmers in Indonesia. Considering how widespread that tobacco farming is, some of
    the findings are surprising insofar as the farmers’ own responses to the survey suggest that
    the livelihood is not a prosperous one for many or even most tobacco-farming house-
    holds. The survey also illuminates the differences between current and former tobacco
    farmers.

    First, the evidence suggests strongly that tobacco cultivation is not profitable for
    most farmers. Though there is some variation, the overall result of a lack of profitability
    is consistent across regions, type of tobacco grown, and whether the farmer is on contract
    to grow tobacco. That said, some regions fare worse than others, and independent farmers
    appear to generally fare better than those on contract. Even when we consider only
    nonlabour costs—or what most agricultural economists would term “gross margins”—
    most tobacco-farming households are spending more on their tobacco cultivation than
    they are making from it. When only a minimum value for household labour is incorporated
    into the profits equation, the overall profitability plummets further. What is more
    problematic is that tobacco farmers are spending disproportionately large amounts of
    time cultivating tobacco leaf compared to nontobacco farmers in the survey, meaning that
    their economically productive time is almost completed subsumed by tobacco growing.
    In contrast, their neighbors who are no longer growing tobacco are generally developing
    more robust and varied economic lives.

    Second, perhaps not surprising considering the lack of profitability, there is
    widespread poverty among tobacco farmers in Indonesia. The proportions of tobacco
    farmers who fall below the World Bank and Indonesian government poverty lines are
    dramatically higher than national averages. As a result, a considerable number of the
    tobacco-farming households are on social assistance of some form, and nearly three
    quarters require use of “rice for the poor” programs to feed their families.

    Third, on average, former tobacco farmers are doing better economically than
    current ones. While the former tobacco farmers are not yet enjoying high levels of
    prosperity, the results of the survey highlight several important dynamics. First, former
    tobacco farmers’ costs to farm are much lower than current tobacco farmers, and as a
    result their overall net revenue is typically higher. Second, the former tobacco farmers are
    spending far fewer hours in their fields and there is clear evidence that many of them use
    that time to do other economically productive activities such as running a small business
    on the side.

Fourth, there is fairly widespread food insecurity among tobacco-farming house-
holds. In all regions, 60 percent or more of the households reported some time during
the year when there was not sufficient food for the household. As mentioned above, the
majority of tobacco-farming households were in the government’s subsidized rice program.

Fifth, tobacco farmers in this survey were more likely than former tobacco farm-
ers to display the symptoms of green tobacco sickness. There has not been a lot of
research on this issue in Indonesia or even globally, but these clear results suggest that it
requires more attention. Tobacco farming is hazardous to the farmers’ health if the proper
precautions are not taken.

If tobacco farming is not a particularly viable crop for most tobacco farmers, how
should policy makers react? First, governments could better farmers’ lives by helping to
improve supply chains and markets for other goods. It is clear that many former tobacco
farmers are making a better living growing other types of crops for sale, an outcome that
could be further enhanced with small investments by governments. It is clear that current
tobacco farmers believe that the supply chains for tobacco are better—which may in
fact be currently correct—but this is a place of realistic intervention by national and local
authorities. Similarly, governments could also help to grow markets—including exports—
for other agricultural goods. Indonesia is in an enviable position of multiple growing seasons
and other favorable conditions for the cultivation of crops for smallholder farmers. They
just need better assurances that they would have places to sell their goods.

Improved farmers’ financial literacy will likely help tobacco farmers make better
cropping and business decisions. The evidence here demonstrates that farming non-
tobacco crops is more lucrative though many tobacco farmers continue to believe the
opposite. This is likely in considerable part a shortcoming of agricultural education.
Governments can help all farmers by providing more and better agricultural extension
services to promote nontobacco crops. There is a broader element in this scenario,
too, of concerns about the quality of general farm management. The results here
demonstrate that many farmers are struggling to evaluate their own costs accurately.
With better farm business and management skills, they could make cropping decisions
that better reflect the reality of the economic outcomes that we observe here.

Though farmers did not consistently identify a lack of credit as a central challenge,
the survey results suggest that the farmers had limited capital. Thus, greater access
to capital through improved credit schemes could help to improve the possibilities for
tobacco farmers to cultivate other crops and/or develop other nonagricultural economic
enterprises.
