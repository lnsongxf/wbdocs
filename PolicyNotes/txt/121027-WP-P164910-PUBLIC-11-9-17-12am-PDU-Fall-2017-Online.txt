          Pakistan from the perspectives of jobs, enabling new startup businesses, women's
          entrepreneurship and export competitiveness.

                       percent of GDP, compared to 4.6 percent in FY16. A less-than-satisfactory tax
                       collection effort by the center and the provinces, combined with an unprecedented
                       increase in development spending, led to this slide. The provinces have posted ﬁscal
                       surpluses over the past few years, but these turned into a deﬁcit of 0.5 percentage points
                       of GDP in FY17. On the external side, the current account deﬁcit widened
                       substantially. The trade deﬁcit widened as imports surged and exports declined
                       marginally. While structural issues have caused a long-term decline in Pakistan's export
                       competitiveness, exchange rate ﬂexibility remains critical to supporting
                       competitiveness. Furthermore, international remittances, which have been resilient to
                       previous international and domestic shocks, declined. As a result, Pakistan's ofﬁcial
                       reserves fell to US$16.2 billion at the end of FY17 compared to a high of US$18.1
                       billion at the end of FY16 – enough to cover imports for 3.1 months. See Section A2
                       for further discussion of ﬁscal accounts and A4 for further discussion of the balance of
                       payments.

…while                 The public debt stock declined to 68.1 percent of GDP in FY17, compared to 68.6
expansion in           percent of GDP in FY16, despite an expansion in the ﬁscal deﬁcit. Favorable currency
public debt was        movement, growth in nominal GDP, and the drawdown of government deposits with
marginal…              the banking sector allowed for this decline. Commercial loans dominated the public
                       external debt borrowing during the year. However, domestic debt composition seems
                       to be undergoing a structural shift, with an increase in the proportion of short-term
                       borrowing. This substitution toward short-term borrowing could pose reﬁnancing and
                       repricing risks. See Section A3 for details of debt and its dynamics.

…and inﬂation          Inﬂation remained contained, rising moderately in FY17, but staying well below the
remained               year's target of 6 percent. An improved domestic supply situation and stable exchange
well-anchored          rate helped curtail headline inﬂation, which was recorded at 4.2 percent during the year.
despite trending       As a result, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the policy rate unchanged at 5.75
upward                 percent throughout FY17. Encouragingly, private sector credit picked up in FY17 due
                       to the net retirement of government borrowing to scheduled banks and low real
                       interest rates. The credit to the private sector grew by 16.8 percent, expanding by Rs.
                       748 billion over FY16 levels. The improvement was broad-based in terms of ﬁnancing
                       instruments, but was concentrated in the manufacturing sector. See Section A5 for
                       further discussion of monetary policy and inﬂation.

Pakistan’s growth      Growth is expected to continue accelerating, and reach 5.8 percent in FY19. However,
outlook is positive,   going forward, this momentum is contingent on managing the challenges that have
but contingent on      emerged on the external and ﬁscal fronts. Growth is expected to be driven by public and
maintaining            private consumption, aided by a steady increase in public investment, especially due to
macroeconomic          projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). On the supply side,
stability…             growth will likely be supported by services and industry. The wide current account
                       deﬁcit is expected to remain a concern and pressure on international reserves is likely to
                       persist. Similarly, further ﬁscal consolidation will also remain challenging. The
                       imbalances also make Pakistan more vulnerable to domestic and external shocks,
                       limiting the economy's ability to absorb such shocks. Export competitiveness could be
                       eroded further if the US dollar appreciates and there is limited ﬂexibility in the
                       exchange rate. Thus, a competitive real effective exchange rate (REER), supporting
                       exports and import-competing industries, will contribute to addressing imbalances on
                       the external front. See Sections B1 and B2 for discussions of the outlook and risks,
                       respectively.

structural reforms   ﬁscal and private sector reforms will be critical. Pakistan aims to increase tax collection

                     rationalization, diversiﬁcation, and integration with global value chains would need to
                     be reﬂected in the government's upcoming Strategic Trade Policy Framework
                     (2018–23), responding to the decline in the country's exports. Structural reforms
                     complemented by supportive monetary, ﬁscal, and ﬁnancial sector policies will be
                     required to improve the economy's competitiveness. See Section B3 for further

Moving the needle    Overall, there has been some improvement in human development indicators since

growth               health, indicators such as skilled birth attendance and child immunization rates have
                     improved. However, stunting is chronically high among children under ﬁve years of
                     age, with 44 percent in this age group being either severely or moderately stunted.
                     Public ﬁnancing for the human development sectors (as a percentage of GDP) remains
                     low, especially so in health. In terms of poverty, Pakistan has made substantial progress,
                     reducing its poverty rate from 64.3 percent in 2001 to 29.5 percent in 2013. However,
                     shared prosperity has declined in more recent years, suggesting an uptick in inequality.
                     Water and sanitation infrastructure has also improved since 2010, but a large
                     proportion of the population does not yet have access to piped water at home or toilets
                     linked to a sewage system, which are considered essential factors contributing to the
                     high incidence of stunting. Similarly, in terms of gender, gradual improvements in
                     maternal mortality ratios and adolescent fertility rates are encouraging, but a concerted
                     effort is required to accelerate the pace of these gains. See Section C for further
                     discussion of human development indicators.

Growth-oriented      Pakistan's working-age population is expected to continue to grow at 2.1 percent per
entrepreneurship     year over the next decade. The country faces the triple challenge of creating enough
could stimulate      jobs for this growing population, improving the quality and productivity of jobs, and
job creation for     enhancing access to jobs and economic opportunities for women. Entrepreneurship
a rapidly growing    can play a key role in meeting these job challenges, especially in the small-and-medium
young population…    enterprise sector. More than a third of those participating in the labor force are self-
                     employed. However, the share of growth-oriented businesses among these is low, as
                     most people opt for self-employment out of 'necessity' rather than 'opportunity'. Most
                     businesses remain small and do not contribute to job creation. Data from the formal
                     private sector in Pakistan suggests that there are signiﬁcant barriers to growth-oriented
                     entrepreneurship – the kind that could provide more and better employment
                     opportunities to a growing workforce. The investment climate is weak, as reﬂected in
                     the country's Doing Business (DB) rankings, and most businesses identify corruption,
                     electricity, and tax rates as the top three constraints they face. See Section D1 for
                     further discussion of jobs and entrepreneurship in Pakistan.

…which requires       A key driver of growth entrepreneurship is the health of a country's startup ecosystem.

ecosystem for         marketplace, create jobs, and contribute to economic growth. However, the ability of

and women-led         of the ecosystem in which they operate. This includes the type of 'support' services
businesses in         available, access to 'ﬁnance' and the 'policy' and regulatory environment. Pakistan's
particular            startup ecosystem has evolved rapidly in recent years, with substantial growth in the
                      level of support services available to entrepreneurs through business incubators and
                      accelerators, and access to ﬁnance through venture capitalists and angel investors.
                      However, these developments are limited to major cities, and several policy bottlenecks
                      remain, making it expensive and difﬁcult for young entrepreneurs to grow their
                      businesses. For women, the challenges of starting and growing a business are especially
                      acute in Pakistan, leading to a very low percentage of women in business. Even women
                      who do run their own businesses tend to be 'necessity entrepreneurs' operating in low-
                      productivity sectors. Converting entrepreneurial potential into jobs and economic
                      growth in the country will thus require policy interventions that support startups in
                      general and women-led businesses in particular. See Sections D2 and D3, respectively,
                      for further discussion of the startup ecosystem and women's entrepreneurship in
                      Pakistan.

                      of 55 percent, indicating the existence of barriers and informational asymmetries,
                      which prevent small ﬁrms from accessing quality inputs at globally competitive prices.
                      While peer countries have managed to diversify their export base, Pakistan's export
                      basket remains concentrated, with the same three exports (cotton manufactures,
                      leather, and rice) making up over 70 percent of total exports for over a decade. Similarly,
                      ﬁve markets have historically accounted for over 60 percent of Pakistan's exports. Even
                      in textiles, the country has not managed to break into high-value-added sectors, while
                      production remains cotton-based contrary to the global shift toward synthetic
                      materials. Holistic reforms in trade policy, trade facilitation, logistics, and infrastructure,
                      as well as overarching investment climate reforms are required if the loss of global
                      competitiveness is to be reversed. See Section D4 for more detail.

                   However, it is no longer the fastest-growing region in the world. 1 This is a consequence
                   of the deceleration in India, the region's powerhouse. 2 While growth has accelerated

                   Overall, South Asia has done well on the internal front, with inﬂation rates declining
                   and staying below target in most countries. Its performance has been less impressive,
                   however, on the external front, with trade and current account deﬁcits increasing in
                   most of the region. From a policy perspective, a major concern across South Asia is the
                   widening of ﬁscal deﬁcits, which now exceed 5 percent of GDP in most countries in the

Investment                      Investment-to-GDP ratio grew marginally from 15.6 percent in FY16 to 15.8 percent in

                                3.8 percent in FY16 to 4.3 percent in FY17. Nevertheless, overall investment remains
                                sluggish, averaging around 15 percent in the past eight years. Several factors have,

…unaided by               The low investment situation was exacerbated by a sustained decline in national savings
national savings          from 14.2 percent of GDP in FY11 to 13.1 percent in FY17. In the last year alone,
                          savings plummeted by 1.2 percent of GDP. Lower proﬁts on National Savings Schemes
                          (NSS) 9 and the continued imposition of withholding tax (WHT) on ﬁnancial
                          transactions may have led to this decline. The government needs to encourage savings
                          in the economy to be able to accumulate sustainable levels of ﬁxed capital over the long
                          term (see Box 1 on the dynamics of savings in Pakistan).

Recovery in           Agriculture (20 percent of GDP) grew by 0.3 percent in FY16 as the cotton crop
agriculture supported production fell by almost 30 percent.10 This year, agriculture turned around, meeting the
supply-side growth    3.5 percent target as plantings switched to sugarcane and, combined with sugar reserves
                      and high support prices, translated into positive sugar export prospects 11 (Figure 3).
                      Cotton also grew by 7.6 percent despite the falling area under cotton12, accompanied by
                      a bumper wheat crop of 25.8 million tons.13 Overall, important crops 14grew at a higher rate
                      than expected – by 4.1 percent compared to a decline of 5.5 percent in FY16. This
                      revival received impetus from enabling key policy measures such as fertilizer subsidy,
                      tax relief measures 15and better access to credit.16 Livestock grew at the same rate of 3.4
                      percent as last year, cotton ginning at 5.6 percent (–22 percent in FY16), and forestry at 14.5
                      percent (14.3 percent in FY16), while ﬁshing fell by 2 percentage points to 1.2 percent in
                      FY17.

Industry continues        The industry sector (20 percent of GDP) grew by 5 percent, at a lower rate than the 7.7
to grow, though           percent target and 5.8 percent growth rate in FY16. Mining and quarrying growth fell to
the momentum              1.3 percent (7 percent in FY16), while construction normalized to 9 percent (15 percent in
has slowed down           FY16). Electricity and gas generation and distribution grew by only 3 percent (8 percent in
                          FY16), mainly because generation declined. Manufacturing, the largest component of
                          industry, grew by 5.3 percent (3.7 percent in FY16), with 5 percent growth in large-scale
                          manufacturing (LSM) 17 (3 percent in FY16), given the strong growth in sugar, steel
                          products, 18 electronics, 19 and tractors 20 (Figure 4). On the other hand, cigarette

                           8 National    savings, which represent the difference between disposable income and consumption, have replaced
                              domestic savings – a concept used by the World Bank before 2006. The change was made to conform to SNA concepts
                              and deﬁnitions.
                            9
                              For instance, the proﬁt rate on Behbood Savings Certiﬁcates – one of the many NSS instruments – fell from 10.56
                              percent on June 30, 2016 to 9.6 percent by end-June 2017.
                          10 Following a prolonged cold spell, severe pest attacks, and depressed cotton prices, which reduced incentives to invest
                              in good-quality pesticides and inputs.
                          11 Almost 308 million metric tons of sugar were exported in FY17, indicating a 5 percent growth in the export volume
                              compared to last year.
                          12
                              Although this decline in FY17 was broad-based (except for maize and sugarcane), it was more pronounced for cotton,
                              which fell from 2.9 million hectares in FY16 to 2.5 million hectares in FY17.
                          13
                              This is more than the estimated average annual domestic consumption of 24.5 million tons. (Source: FAS-USDA). The
                              excess production coupled with substantial wheat stocks appears to be exportable surplus. However, the widening
                              price differential (domestic versus international) has hampered exports of this commodity.
                          14 These include cotton, rice, sugarcane, wheat, and maize.
                          15 These include, among others, the exemption of 7 percent sales tax on pesticides and the reduction of sales tax on urea
                              from 17 percent to 5 percent.
                          16 This was the ﬁrst year that microﬁnance institutions (such as the National Rural Support Program and Khushhali
                              Bank) were included in agri-ﬁnancing.
                          17
                              The provisional data for the complete ﬁscal year points toward a higher growth rate of 5.6 percent for FY17.
                          18 Owing to sustained growth in construction and restraint in the import of steel products from China, following the
                              imposition of anti-dumping duties (6.0–40.5 percent) in February 2017.

                       Box 1: Dynamics of Low Savings in Pakistan
     Pakistan seems to be stuck in a low-savings-low-investment trap, which has seriously hampered its
     growth potential. It is not surprising, therefore, that nearly all of Pakistan's high-growth periods have
                                                                                                               23
     coincided with abundant inﬂows of foreign savings (in the form of external loans, grants, and remittances).
     Accordingly, whenever such inﬂows dried up, economic growth slid back, as domestic savings and
     investment were never enough to sustain the growth momentum. While foreign savings are important in
     ﬁnancing the savings-investment gap, the most reliable source of funds for investment in a country is its
     own savings. Pakistan's record in this respect is not encouraging. Its savings rate of 13.8 percent of GDP
     (2011–15 average) also compares unfavorably with that of neighboring countries: the savings rate in
     India was 33.2 percent, in Bangladesh 29.7 percent, and in Sri Lanka 24.5 percent over the same period.

     The savings behavior of economic agents is a complex phenomenon and is an outcome of the
     interaction of many social and economic factors. The key determinants of the savings rate are (i) income
     level, (ii) inﬂation, and (iii) the rate of return on savings. While past trends in the savings rate as well as its
     recent fall can be explained by real GDP growth, inﬂation, and the real interest rate, we still need to
     understand the structural factors that have kept savings historically low in Pakistan. The empirical
     literature on the determinants of savings behavior ﬁnds that education, ﬁnancial deepening, culture,
     religion, and demographic factors (such as the labor force participation rate and dependency ratio) affect
     the private sector savings rate, while political stability is a key determinant of the public savings rate.24

     Low level of savings is one aspect of the problem. An equally important issue is the efﬁcient allocation
     of savings toward investment through the ﬁnancial sector. Less than 50 percent of national savings ﬁnds
     its way into the ﬁnancial sector in Pakistan. The rest is used in real estate or other forms of capital
     formation via informal channels. Interestingly, ﬁnancial savings (i.e., savings in the form of ﬁnancial
     instruments)25declined sharply to 22 percent of the total national savings during 2000–05 – a period of
     real estate boom. Incidentally, interest rates were also very low during this period.

    2. Fiscal Accounts
Pakistan's hard-won          Pakistan registered a consolidated 26 ﬁscal deﬁcit (excluding grants) of 5.8 percent of
ﬁscal consolidation          GDP in FY17 (Table 1) – 2.0 percentage points higher than the target set at the start of
appears to be                the year and 1.2 percentage points higher than that of the previous year. At this level,
eroding away                 FY17 saw a reversal of the gains in ﬁscal consolidation witnessed since FY13. This is
                             particularly true for FY17 as the primary deﬁcit (excluding grants) increased to 1.6
                             percent of GDP, up from 0.3 percent in FY16.

                             23 Loans and grants include project aid, food aid, and non-food aid. There is no conclusive evidence in the literature on
                               the impact of foreign aid on capital formation as there are always questions on the uses of aid. However, in the case of
                               Pakistan, such foreign inﬂows together with remittances seem to have a positive relationship with growth.

                             25 Financial savings include bank savings and ﬁxed deposits, NSS deposits, and postal saving deposits. Demand deposits
                                and currency in circulation are not included as they are kept by the public primarily for transaction purposes. Some
                                households keep cash with the intention to save, but such amounts may not be very signiﬁcant.

Large increases           Total revenues during FY17 recorded a lower growth of 11.0 percent despite healthy
in development            collection in federal non-tax revenues. This was due, primarily, to timid growth in
spending coupled          federal tax collection (responsible for 90 percent of total tax revenues). On the other
with decelerating         hand, total expenditure registered a sizeable jump of 17.3 percent. Recurrent spending
tax revenues led          played its part to some extent, but the main driver was a 30 percent increase in
to the slippage           development expenditure. To put this in perspective, provincial development spending
                          increased by 44 percent over the previous year – the highest increase in Pakistan's
                          history.
Tax performance
remained far from         The total revenue of the consolidated government slowed down in FY17 due to the
satisfactory              weak performance of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). FBR revenue grew by 8
                          percent during FY17, compared with the budgeted growth of 17 percent (Table 2).
                          FBR collection amounted to Rs. 3,361 billion, equal to 93 percent of the FY17 revenue
                          target. 27 The shortfall was broad-based 28 and equaled almost Rs. 260 billion (or 0.8
                          percent of GDP). The lower collection is, in part, a result of relief measures and tax
                          incentives 29 introduced through the federal budget for FY17 to boost investment,
                          exports, and domestic production in the economy. 30 On the other hand, the taxes
                          collected by the provincial governments grew by 13.6 percent during FY17, although
                          this was lower than the 37.6 percent growth seen in FY16.


                          27 The target for FY17 was set at Rs. 3,621 billion.
                          28 Except for customs duties, the collection of which surpassed the budget target by Rs. 83 billion.
                          29
                             For instance, the government allowed sales tax exemptions/concessions on agricultural inputs (fertilizer and
                             pesticides) to reduce the cost of production for farmers. Similarly, it announced incentives such as zero-rating,
                             exemptions of sales tax on imports of new machinery and raw material for textiles, and duty drawbacks to registered
                             exporters to revive exports. The government also offered tax incentives to ﬁrms investing in energy projects. (The State

                          30
                             Despite these incentives, investment inched up by only 0.2 percent of GDP, merchandise exports contracted
                             further by 1.3 percent, and LSM grew by 5.6 percent (as opposed to a target of 5.9 percent) in FY17.

Most of the FBR           During FY17, collections from direct and indirect taxes grew by 12.7 percent and 5.1
collection continues      percent, respectively. Growth in direct taxes, when compared to last year, slowed down
to come from              because of a sustained reduction in corporate taxes. 31 More importantly, the bulk of
customs duties            direct taxes – about 70 percent on average over the last three years – is collected as
and direct taxes…         withholding tax (WHT), which become a form of indirect taxes when treated as ﬁnal
                          tax and passed onto the consumer. For instance, contracts alone comprise a fourth of
                          the collection through WHT. If only this source is classiﬁed as an indirect tax, the share
                          of direct taxation would go down from 40 percent of total FBR collection to
                          approximately 30 percent. This level is abysmally low compared to other developing
                          countries, where direct taxes amount to 55 percent of total tax revenues. 32 Within
                          indirect taxes, customs and federal excise duty (FED) grew by 22 percent and 4 percent,
                          respectively, in FY17. The robustness of customs duties can be attributed to an increase
                          in imports (particularly in transport, food, and machinery) 33 while FED lost its
                          momentum primarily due to the increase in the rate on cigarettes (which comprise a
                          third of total FED collection), eventually affecting the commodity's local production.34
                                                                                                                                                    35

collection stagnated      Interestingly, the collection in FY17 stayed at the level observed in FY16. This ﬂat
                          growth can be traced to the relief measures aimed at supporting export sectors and
                                     36
                          agriculture announced in the federal budget for FY17 (as mentioned before).
                          Furthermore, sales tax revenues were affected by plummeting petroleum revenues due
                          to lower prices and changes to the tax regime.37 The decline in cigarette production
                          following the increase in excise duty also reduced sales tax revenues.




                          31 The government has, in a bid to promote corporatization, been reducing corporate tax rates consistently by 1 percent
                             each year, from 35 percent in FY13 to 30 percent in FY18.

Non-tax revenues           Non-tax revenues increased by 23 percent to Rs. 967 billion after a contraction of 14
largely made up            percent in FY16. However, to put this strong performance in perspective, it is worth
for the slippage           noting that non-tax collection was dwindling till Q3FY17, contracting by 6.2 percent
in tax collection          compared to same period last year. These inﬂows strengthened only in the last quarter
                           of the ﬁscal year and amounted to more than the cumulative collection of the previous
                           three quarters (Rs. 516 billion in Q4 versus Rs. 451 billion till Q3) (Figure 5). Despite
                           the drying up of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) receipts,38 the recovery in Q4FY17 has
                           largely been driven by three categories: (i) interest income in FY17 almost doubled
                           compared to last year, (ii) the recovery of SBP proﬁts in the last quarter,39 and (iii) the
                                                                                              40
                           'others' category witnessed a signiﬁcant increase, mostly in Q4, amounting to Rs. 306
                           billion (Table 3). The latter was due mostly to one-off receipts. For instance, the
                           government sold a portion of its stakes in the printing corporation 41 and Pakistan
                           Development Fund proceeds worth Rs. 64 billion were booked as the sale proceeds of
                           two LNG power plants. Furthermore, Rs. 20 billion was recorded under this category
                           following an amendment to the rules governing 'dead accounts' (dormant plus lapse to
                           the government) under the NSS. 42 On the ﬂip side, dividends from state-owned
                           enterprises (SOEs) have declined substantially. Moreover, royalties on gas and oil
                           declined due to prevailing low domestic petroleum prices. During FY17, provincial
                           non-tax revenue collection contracted by 15 percent in contrast to a healthy growth of
                           23 percent last year.

                           38 Pakistan received CSF ﬂows of just US$550 million in Feb–Mar FY17.
                           39 The proﬁts amounted to Rs. 228 billion during FY17, almost the same level witnessed in FY16.
                           40 The government received Rs. 219 billion alone in Q4FY17.
                           41
                              The SBP acquired the banknotes and prize bonds printing functions of the Pakistan Security Printing Corporation
                              from the federal government. The SBP paid the government a consideration of Rs. 100.149 billion in June 2017 for
                              transfer of ownership and control (State Bank of Pakistan, Press Release No. ERD/M&PRD/PR/01/2017-68).
                           42
                              The original rule under the Savings Account Rules, Government Savings Bank Act 1873, stipulated marking inactive
                              accounts as dormant. Under the amended rule, time limits have been prescribed for these dormant accounts and the
                              scope has been expanded to include all instruments. Moreover, after a certain period, the investment in these accounts
                              is treated as lapsed and booked as the government's non-tax revenue. However, these accounts can be revived any time
                              subject to due diligence of the claims. This move aims to minimize the misuse of dead accounts, but the treatment of
                              recoveries is against the principles of ﬁnancial reporting. NSS ﬂows are categorized as unfunded debt and any
                              recoveries associated with NSS should, ideally, be adjusted in the debt accounts.

The highlight of             Both the federal and provincial governments increased their development expenditure
F Y 17 has been              to record levels. Spending under the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) by
historically high            both tiers of the government amounted to Rs. 1,578 billion,44 surpassing the revised
                                       45
development                  estimates by Rs. 39 billion for the ﬁrst time since FY14. 46 In addition, other
spending                     development expenditure (of which the Benazir Income Support Program is the main
                             component) maintained the same level of Rs. 116 billion during FY17. The federal
                             PSDP grew by 22 percent during FY17 – almost at the same level of growth seen last
                             year. However, the uptake was more pronounced in the last quarter. Moreover, the
                             provincial governments increased their PSDP spending by 44 percent in FY17
                             compared to 19 percent last year. The provincial spending levels in Q4FY17 of about
                             Rs. 430 billion are slightly higher than the development expenditure of Rs. 423 billion
                             spent by the provinces in the ﬁrst three quarters collectively. Acceleration of this
                             magnitude in the last quarter raises questions regarding the quality, efﬁciency, and
                             effectiveness of such spending.
Extraordinary
development                  The federal government's ﬁscal deﬁcit of 5.3 percent of GDP this year was not helped
spending amid                by the provincial governments' performance, which registered a combined deﬁcit of
lower federal                0.5 percent of GDP during FY17. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Sindh contributed
                                                                                                47,48
transfers suggests           the most by running deﬁcits worth Rs. 76 billion and Rs. 63 billion, respectively. This is
the provinces ran a          surprising, given that the provinces face, in principle, hard budget constraints and
sizeable deﬁcit              require the explicit consent of the federal government to initiate any form of deﬁcit
                             44 With a 46/54 federal-provincial composition.
                             45 Revised estimates are based on nine months' actual data and three months' projections for the reference year.
                             46 When the actual spending was higher by Rs. 51 billion from the revised estimates.
                             47 Against an overdraft limit of Rs. 22.5 billion for the Government of Sindh. The               province's request to include the
                                remaining Rs. 40 billion (= Rs. 63 billion – Rs. 22.5 billion) in this limit is still pending with the federal government. The
                                case for KP would also be similar.
                             48
                                These numbers differ from the overall balance reported for the respective provinces as per the ﬁscal operations data
                                released by the Ministry of Finance. The difference arises on account of adjusting the overall balance with
                                development grants to arrive at a provincial deﬁcit (excluding grants) number.

                                                  ﬁnancing beyond a balanced budget stance. Furthermore, the budgeted assumption of
                                                  provincial surpluses (0.9 percentage of GDP for FY17) by the federal government at
                                                  the start of the year did not hold. This situation has become a norm, particularly after
                                                  the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) Award period (Figure 6). Given this
                                                  trend, the assumption of a provincial surplus beyond a certain level is overly optimistic
                                                  in the federal budget without a prior agreement with the provinces. To this end,
                                                  emphasis could be placed on better incentives, coordination in tax revenue
                                                  mobilization, and the overall ﬁscal stance across all layers of government, either in the
                                                  context of the NFC Award or as subject matter for the Council of Common Interests
                                                  (CCI). However, achieving a broad consensus on speciﬁc improvements and modalities
                                                  for strengthening the ﬁscal framework will require extensive dialogue to balance the
                                                  provinces' concerns about preserving their autonomy on the one hand and the need for
                                                  more coordination and ﬂexibility to improve overall economic outcomes on the other.
                                                  In this context, closer alignment of provincial and federal economic objectives could
                                                  help deliver common strategies and coordination mechanisms over time.49

However, the                                      A statistical discrepancy arises from errors or unrecorded transactions in measuring
large reduction in                                ﬁscal account transactions. The discrepancy, in general, is relatively small. However,

                                                  FY17 the statistical discrepancy fell considerably to 0.2 percent of GDP. Adjusting the
                                                  expenditure for this discrepancy, it appears the realized ﬁscal deﬁcit has increased by 0.7

                                                  from the trend in the reported ﬁscal deﬁcit. As far as ﬁscal transparency is concerned,
                                                  this is a step in the right direction.

  3. Debt and its Dynamics

Public debt stayed            As of end-June 2017, the total public debt stood at 68.1 percent of GDP – 0.5
at almost the same            percentage point lower than the June 30, 2016 stock of 68.6 percent 51 (Figure 8). This
level                         slight decline has occurred at a time when the ﬁscal deﬁcit has swelled by 1.2 percent of
                              GDP. 52 The improvement stems primarily from the fact that the growth in nominal
                              GDP has slightly outpaced the growth in nominal public debt stock. There are two
                              other underlying factors at play. First, in a positive development, the government drew
                              down deposits held with the banking sector (including the SBP)53during FY17, primarily
                              to retire some of the in-year borrowings from the SBP. 54 Second, favorable currency
                              movements led to a decrease in the foreign currency public debt-to-GDP ratio (by 0.3
                              percentage point) despite substantial borrowings. These pertain to (i) a largely stable
                              Pakistani rupee against the US dollar 55 and (ii) revaluation gains 56 accruing from an
                              appreciating US dollar against the Japanese yen.57

                              51 Public   debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated by the World Bank as per the Government Financial Statistics Manual 2014,
                                 and is the deﬁnition used in this report. This results in the inclusion of external debt of public enterprises
                                 not included in the debt stock as deﬁned by the Government of Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan ofﬁcial
                                 statistics show public debt-to-GDP ratio of 67.2 percent as of June 30, 2017, compared to 67.6 percent of GDP in
                                 FY16.
                              52 This is the opposite of the previous year (FY16) when public debt increased by 4.4 percent despite the decline in the
                                 ﬁscal deﬁcit by 0.7 percent of GDP.
                              53 Government deposits contracted by Rs. 80 billion during FY17, as opposed to an accumulation of Rs. 459 billion
                                 during FY16.
                              54 Owing to the slow mobilization of market funding (particularly during Q1), the government borrowed heavily from
                                 the central bank to repay the heavy maturities due in that period.
                              55
                                 During FY17, the Pakistani rupee depreciated by only 0.1 percent against the US dollar (point-to-point).
                              56 A revaluation gain/loss implies the appreciation/depreciation of the US dollar against major currencies. In Pakistan,
                                 external loans are contracted in various currencies, but disbursements are effectively converted into Pakistani rupees.
                                 Since the rupee is not an internationally traded currency, other currencies are bought and sold by selling and buying US
                                 dollars. Hence, the currency exposure of foreign debt originates from two sources: US dollar/other foreign currencies
                                 and Pakistani rupee/US dollar. The former exchange rate movement is termed a revaluation gain/loss.
                              57 More than 95 percent of Pakistan's outstanding public external debt is concentrated in three major currencies: the US
                                 dollar (60 percent), the euro (20 percent), and the Japanese yen (16 percent). During FY17, the US dollar appreciated
                                 by almost 8 percent against the yen (stock valuation).

Commercial loans        Pakistan received record-high gross disbursements amounting to US$10.1 billion in
dominated public        FY17 under public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt (Table 5).
external debt           Furthermore, disbursements during June 2017 alone touched US$2.7 billion for the
disbursements…          ﬁrst time in Pakistan. In totality, some 43 percent came from commercial banks during
                                                                                                             58
                        FY17. Chinese banks dominated this category, lending to the tune of US$2.3 billion.
                        To put this in perspective, commercial borrowing has only gathered pace since FY16
                        when the country received US$1.4 billion. However, the magnitude in FY17 is more
                        than three times that in FY16. The government deems this instrument a diversiﬁcation
                        of its existing funding avenues. However, these bullet facilities of relatively short
                        horizons 59can create repayment issues in the future. Furthermore, in FY17 ﬁnancing
                        from China (both bilateral and commercial) became as important as ﬂows from
                        multilaterals. In October 2016, Pakistan successfully issued an international sukuk
                                                 60
                        bond of US$1.0 billion with a maturity of ﬁve years. The proﬁt rate was 5.5 percent –
                        the lowest ever in Pakistan's history and 125 bps lower than that on the same-maturity
                        sukuk bond issued in November 2014.

                        (versus 37 percent last year). Interestingly, the share of permanent debt 62 mirrored this
                        trend in the opposite direction, falling from 44 percent in FY16 to 37 percent in FY17.
                        This implies that the government substituted medium-to-long-term debt with short-
                        term debt to meet its ﬁnancing needs during FY17. Such a ﬁnancing strategy is not in
                        line with the strategic guideline of lengthening the maturity proﬁle of domestic debt,

                           Among these are US$1 billion and US$700 million single-tranche facility agreements contracted with the China
                           Development Bank. Moreover, two similar agreements worth US$300 million were signed and fully disbursed by the
                           Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China during FY17. These are medium-term loans meant
                           for balance-of-payments support with an in-built bullet repayment feature, a maturity of two to three years and a
                           ﬂoating rate based on the LIBOR.
                        59 However, in June 2017, two World Bank guarantees (US$630 million) helped Pakistan secure over US$1 billion in
                           international commercial ﬁnancing. In both cases, the tenor was extended to 10 years.

                        62 This is the medium-to-long-term arm of domestic debt. Notable instruments include prize bonds, Pakistan

but mainly in        accepted a slightly higher volume than the target set for FY17. 66 In aggregate,
shorter tenors       commercial banks exhibited the most interest in the shortest tenor throughout the year
                     (Figure 9). The 12-month paper did not generate much interest, reﬂecting the market's
                     short-term view, 67 speciﬁcally from Q2FY17 onwards. Similarly, banks offered more
                     than twice the target announced for Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) over FY17.
                     Given this response, the government could tap little higher than the target 68 and
                     accepted half the offers in all. However, it rejected all the bids in PIB auctions held
                     during Q2FY17 (Figure 10) as the banks were bidding for higher rates. Nevertheless,
                     there was a mismatch between the yearly target (Rs. 800 billion) and the maturity due in
                     FY17 (Rs1.93 trillion) in this instrument. This prompted the government to meet the
                     rest of its ﬁnancing needs by resorting heavily to the SBP. Thus, market-related treasury
                     bills (MRTBs) witnessed an addition of Rs. 912 billion to the stock in the ﬁrst quarter.
                     The remaining quarters, however, were marked by sizeable net retirements under
                     MRTBs. In aggregate, MRTBs worth Rs. 451 billion were added during FY17 to the
                     outstanding stock of June 30, 2016.

                        Reﬁnancing risk refers to the risk that debt may be reﬁnanced at an unusually high cost or, in extreme cases, cannot be
                        reﬁnanced at all. Repricing risk refers to the risk of increases in the cost of the debt arising from changes in interest
                        rates.
                     64 The last available public debt risk report (of December 2016) already points toward a slight deterioration in key
                        indicators. For instance, domestic debt re-ﬁxing and maturing in one year increased from 52.8 percent and 51.9 percent
                        as of end-June 2016 to 53.6 percent and 52.7 percent as of end-December 2016, respectively. (Source: Public Debt

Despite these                              Nonetheless, Pakistan's public debt is expected to fall to 66.4 percent by FY19 (Table
vulnerabilities,                           6). This projected declining trajectory (based on the medium-term projections for
the public debt                            FY18–19; see section on Outlook) is due mainly to the nominal growth in GDP
continues to                               outpacing the nominal growth in public debt over the projection horizon. However,
decline…                                   this downward trajectory assumes ﬁscal tightening post-election (2018) and any
                                           deviation from the expected path of ﬁscal consolidation may lead to an upward trend in
                                           the public debt.

of the amended       is reduced to 60 percent of GDP. The legislation further stipulates that, within a period

 4. Balance of Payments

Pakistan's           Pakistan's external account position experienced a considerable slide in FY17 due to a
international        substantial widening of the current account deﬁcit, which has resulted in the decline of
reserves are under   international reserves. Despite this decline, the ofﬁcial exchange rate remained stable in
stress because of    FY17. The current account dynamics deteriorated on the back of a large trade deﬁcit
a high and           driven by a rapid increase in imports, coupled with another year of weak export
widening trade       performance. The increase in imports came on the back of higher fuel, food,
deﬁcit               machinery, and transport group imports driven by strong domestic demand. However,
                     limited exchange rate ﬂexibility may have contributed to higher imports and the
                     widening trade deﬁcit (see Box 2 for a discussion of exchange rate dynamics in
                     Pakistan). A decline in remittances for the ﬁrst time in a decade also aggravated the
                     current account deﬁcit. The external ﬁnancing gap increased in FY17 compared to
                     FY16, which resulted in a decline in ofﬁcial reserves to US$16.2 billion by end-June
                     2017, compared to US$18.2 billion at end-June 2016.

                     70 Circular debt is estimated to have crossed Rs. 400 billion (or 1.3 percent of GDP) as of end-June 2017. As per World
                        Bank staff estimates, some Rs. 350 billion will be added to the existing stock by FY20 if the underlying causes of non-
                        collection and high losses are not addressed.
                     71 IMF staff estimate an overvaluation in the 10–18 percent range for the Pakistani rupee based on an IMF-wide external
                        balance assessment (EBA). At the same time, the REER-based EBA-lite method, explicitly accounting for factors
                        such as remittances and aid ﬂows, suggests a slightly larger overvaluation of about 20 percent. The REER gap is
                        therefore estimated to be in the 10–20 percent range (IMF Country Report No. 17/212).
                     72 This is one of the standard sensitivity tests to the baseline scenario under the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability
                        Framework for Middle-Income Countries. A one-time 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation shock corresponds
                        approximately to a two-standard-deviation shock to the US$ value of the GDP deﬂator growth.

The current account       The current account deﬁcit for FY17 swelled to 4.1 percent of GDP (US$12.4 billion),
deﬁcit swelled to         compared to 1.7 percent of GDP in the last year – the highest level since FY08. A large
4.1 percent of GDP,       trade deﬁcit proved to be the key driver of this imbalance, which jumped to US$26.6
its highest level in      billion (8.7 percent of GDP) compared to US$19.3 billion (6.9 percent of GDP) last
nearly a decade           year, on the back of declining exports and high import growth. Declining remittances
                          and CSF inﬂows exacerbated the current account deﬁcit (Table 7).

The fall in exports,      Exports continued to shrink for a third consecutive year in FY17, albeit at a much lower
remittances, and          pace of 0.2 percent (y-o-y). Imports, after slowing down in FY16, accelerated in FY17,
CSF inﬂows,               growing by 17.6 percent (y-o-y). This resulted in a substantial widening of the trade
coupled with high         deﬁcit from 6.9 percent in FY16 to 8.7 percent in FY17. In addition, remittances

despite some                                    percent in 2016. The impact of this recovery was felt in merchandise exports in South
uplift in the                                   Asia, which recovered in 2017. Despite this recovery in regional exports, Pakistan's

prices of textiles                              decline in the previous year. While exports declined in FY16 as a result of lower prices,
and rice, along                                 the quantum effect caused a marginal decline in export earnings in FY17. The decline
with global                                     was broad-based: its major contributors were food and textiles, which constitute about
demand                                          75 percent of Pakistan's exports. Food group exports declined by 3.0 percent, whereas
                                                the textiles group declined by 2.4 percent in FY17. The latter's poor performance is a

Pakistan's exports                              The disaggregated data reveals that the decline in textile exports was mostly driven by
continued to lose                               the weak performance of low-value-added sectors, which include cotton yarn, cotton

competitiveness                                 of export competitiveness). The country's weak export performance is an outcome of
                                                poor trade facilitation, logistics, and infrastructure; a worsening investment climate; and

Growth


Imports grew                      Imports increased by 17.6 percent during FY17 in contrast to a decline of 0.2 percent in
strongly, partly due              the previous ﬁscal year. This is the highest y-o-y import growth since FY08. While the
to CPEC projects,                 capital goods imports linked with CPEC projects contributed partly to this increase
but mainly on the                 (Figure 12), a signiﬁcant contribution to this growth came from consumer goods and
back of fuel imports              petroleum group imports.

Petroleum imports                 Petroleum group imports, which touched US$10.6 billion in FY17 compared to US$8.4
jumped on the                     billion in FY16, were largely driven by higher imports of crude and petroleum products
back of strong                    (Figure 13). Relatively stable domestic oil prices, complemented by a stable exchange
domestic demand                   rate, led to higher domestic demand for petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL). High-
and stable fuel                   speed diesel (HSD) and petroleum product (excluding furnace oil) sales recorded
prices                            growth rates of 26.2 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively, as per OCAC. HSD sales
                                  slowed down in H2FY17 as domestic HSD prices were hiked initially by Rs. 5.8 and
                                  then by Rs. 5.6 per liter.

Food group and                    The non-POL segment also contributed to import growth, with sharp growth recorded
capital goods                     in food items and machinery (17.8 percent and 11.5 percent y-o-y, respectively). The
imports also                      increase in non-oil imports came on the back of (i) the continued implementation of
increased                         CPEC projects, (ii) a decline in the domestic production of pulses, and (iii) an increase
                                  in international palm oil prices.

High ﬁnancial             Financial inﬂows from steady FDI and loan receipts from commercial and international
ﬂows hedged the           ﬁnancial institutions partially eased the growing pressure on the external sector (Figure
external sector gap       15). Pakistan's gross general government disbursements touched US$10 billion during
to a large extent         FY17, which was a ﬁrst in the country's history. Commercial borrowing touched
                          US$4.4 billion compared to US$1.4 billion in FY16. Bilateral disbursements increased
                          to US$1.8 billion in FY17, up from US$1.2 billion in FY16. This healthy inﬂow
                          contained Pakistan's external sector ﬁnancing gap to a large extent (Figure 16). Despite
                          this, its foreign exchange reserves declined from US$18.2 billion at end-June 2016 to
                          US$16.2 billion by end-June 2017, which was sufﬁcient for 3.1 months' import

Despite a decline                               Despite a substantial decline in international reserves, the nominal exchange rate

Pakistani rupee to                              resulted in the REER appreciating by 3.4 percent during FY17. This appreciation
US dollar exchange                              contributed to the widening external ﬁnancing gap and the decline in international
rate remained                                   reserves. Cumulatively, the REER has appreciated by 13 percent over the last three

          allowed to ﬂoat on July 21, 2000.81 However, the country seems to have followed a managed ﬂoat regime.
          Pakistan is not the only country that has followed this policy path in exchange rate management: a
          signiﬁcant number of countries with a ﬂexible exchange rate de jure or de facto manage their exchange
          rates to avoid excessive volatility.83Over the past few years, the Pakistani rupee has been relatively stable
          against an appreciating US dollar, which has resulted in a strong Pakistani rupee compared to many other
          currencies in Asia. Recent analysis suggests that the Pakistani rupee is overvalued.84 Such misalignment
          can contribute to the buildup of external account pressures and a loss in export competitiveness, leading
          to a decline in exports (Figure 2A).
                                                                                                               85
          Exchange rate volatility in emerging market economies can affect investment and growth.

   correct for the estimated overvaluation should have limited economic costs, while helping narrow the
   trade balance in the medium term, reducing pressure on the external accounts. This is in line with
   empirical evidence that suggests that moderate and gradual adjustments tend to have a positive impact on

   Exchange rate ﬂexibility is a key part of the macroeconomic adjustment process for open economies with
   liberalized capital accounts. Experience shows that countries with limited capital ﬂows, such as Pakistan,
   are better able to use a ﬂexible exchange rate as a tool to address emerging imbalances. In the medium
   term, this would support the external balance through improved competitiveness.

                                     Interestingly, the last meeting of FY17 (held on May 20, 2017) concluded with a unanimous decision to maintain the

Credit to the                      As a result of the net retirement of government borrowing to scheduled banks and low
private sector                     real interest rates, private sector credit in FY17 has grown faster than a year ago. Credit
picked up                          to the private sector (mostly businesses) expanded by Rs. 748 billion, i.e., 16.8 percent
                                   (y-o-y). The improvement in credit off-take was concentrated in the manufacturing
                                   sector91,92 (food products and beverages, and textiles).93 Moreover, the growth was visible
                                   across all categories: working capital, ﬁxed investment, and trade ﬁnance. Credit to

                                   PSEs almost trebled during FY17 compared to the level observed last year. This strong
                                   growth was driven largely by energy sector PSEs. These loans generally feature inherent
                                   government guarantees, thereby allowing the scheduled banks to lend comfortably to

Inﬂation rose                      Domestic demand experienced further recovery in FY17 due to the increase in
moderately…                        domestic consumption. Despite this increase in domestic demand, headline inﬂation
                                   rose moderately to 4.2 percent over the year, staying below the target of 6 percent for
                                   the third consecutive year. This also reﬂects the better domestic supply situation,

                                             which helped keep headline inﬂation in check. Recovery in domestic demand is also
                                             evident from the gradually increasing non-food-non-energy (NFNE) inﬂation in
                                             FY17. However, it too remained well below levels of recent years. The increase in
                                             headline inﬂation was broad-based in FY17 as around 80 percent of the items in the
                                             consumer price index (CPI) basket recorded an increase over FY16 price levels. This
                                             translated into a 3.8 percent increase in food inﬂation and 4.4 percent non-food
                                             inﬂation in FY17 (Figure 17).

…mainly due to                               The slight increase in headline inﬂation toward the end of FY17 was driven by a
recovering                                   recovery in international oil and commodity prices. The ﬂuctuation in global oil prices
international oil                            in H2FY17 resulted in frequent changes in HSD and petrol prices domestically. This
and commodity                                pushed y-o-y inﬂation to 5 percent in May 2017 before it dipped in June 2017 due to a
prices                                       downward revision in petrol prices. Despite better domestic supply, food inﬂation
                                             increased to 3.8 percent in FY17 compared to 2.1 percent last year, mainly on the back
                                             of an increase in international prices of pulses. Nonetheless, Pakistan's headline
                                             inﬂation remains well below historical levels – enabled by low but rising underlying
                                             (core) inﬂation (see Figure 18). The stability of the Pakistani rupee, despite growing
                                             external account pressure in FY17, helped curtail the pass-through of mildly
                                             recovering international oil and commodity prices to domestic consumers.

 1. Outlook
GDP growth is           Despite an increase in macroeconomic imbalances during FY17, GDP growth is
projected to increase   projected to increase moderately and touch 5.8 percent by FY19 (Table 9 and Figure
moderately, provided    19). This outlook is contingent on maintaining macroeconomic stability as well as
macroeconomic           steady progress in implementing the main pillars of the government's medium-term
risks are managed       reform program, which targets key constraints to growth. The outlook assumes that oil
                        prices will increase slightly but remain low, and that political and security risks are
                        managed. On the demand side, acceleration will be driven by public and private
                        consumption, aided by a moderate increase in investment. Aggregate consumption is
                        expected to grow due to a marginal recovery in remittances and higher government
                        expenditure during the election cycle. Investment is expected to grow moderately due
                        to higher capital expenditures by the government and an increase in FDI and external
                        loans for CPEC projects (Figure 20 and 21).

                       over the past ﬁscal year. This was accompanied by a signiﬁcant widening of the ﬁscal
                       deﬁcit after several years of successful ﬁscal tightening. The worsening external and
                       ﬁscal balances coincided with the end of the IMF program. Policy adjustments will be

Recent tax reforms     In recent years, Pakistan's tax revenues have grown signiﬁcantly (from 9.5 percent of

crucial                revenue reached 0.9 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, to sustain these gains, the next level
                       of reforms needs to be implemented. The objectives of such reforms should include
                       the broadening of the tax base, increased tax compliance, and reduced administrative
                       and taxpayer compliance costs. To achieve these, a comprehensive review of tax policy
                       is required, assessing it against the key principles of neutrality, fairness, and
                       transparency. In addition, a fully automated and able tax administration is imperative to
                       take advantage of modern IT infrastructure that uses the available data to reduce
                       chances of tax evasion. Finally, post-18th Constitutional Amendment, the lack of
                       coordination among different tax authorities has increased the compliance cost of
                       taxpayers. There is a need to establish a coordination mechanism to resolve taxation
                       issues between the federal government and the provinces, and among the provinces.

                       signiﬁcant potential of FDI in Pakistan.

                       Pushing the boundaries of transparency by making key ﬁscal data readily available in
                       user-friendly formats through open government data portals will provide a platform
                       for holding the government accountable for the use of public funds. Improving SOE
                       compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance for PSEs will instill conﬁdence
                       among citizens and stakeholders, complemented by efforts to improve the ﬁnancial
                       reporting framework, oversight by the Ministry of Finance, and improved
                       transparency through availability of audited ﬁnancial statements. Together, these
                       reforms will result in a stronger, more transparent PFM and procurement systems that

                       only country in South Asia to do so. However, into 2018 it declined to 147 out of 190
                       economies, compared to 144 into 2017. Pakistan's recent DB reforms include
                       improvements relating to: business registrations, transparency in land records
                       management and property registration, access to credit information, an electronic
                       customs platform for easier trading across borders, and protection of minority
                       investors. Regulatory authorities continue to develop electronic tools for improving

                    Box 3: Doing Business Reforms in Pakistan
     Jumpstarting investment has proved difﬁcult for Pakistan. Its investment-to-GDP ratio has stagnated
     since the 1990s, hovering around 15 percent. A combination of factors has contributed to this lackluster
     performance, one of which is the challenging operating environment for businesses. This is reﬂected in
                            97
     Pakistan's DB ranking – 147 out of 190 economies (DB Report 2018). Furthermore, an analysis of the
                                   98
     country's distance-to-frontier score has decreased in recent years: from 52.9 in 2011 to 51.6 in 2018.
     This is well below most South Asian economies and Pakistan fares poorly when compared to the steady
     progress made by other regional economies such as India, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka.99

     The worsening DB rankings galvanized the Government of Pakistan to launch a three-year DB Reform
     Strategy in 2017, with the goal of achieving an overall DB ranking below 100. Pakistan's wide-ranging
     and deep-seated investment climate constraints involve both federal and provincial jurisdictions. The
     strategy thus takes a 'whole-of-government' approach, involving both tiers of the state. Key areas where
     signiﬁcant progress has been made include: improvements in land records management and property
     transfers in Punjab, enhanced access to credit information systems through expansion of coverage and
     strengthening borrowers' rights, and the launch of electronic customs platforms in Lahore and Karachi
     to increase ease of cross-border trade. These reforms led to Pakistan being recognized as one of the 10
     economies 100 that had made the biggest improvements in business regulations in DB 2017.

     The following major reforms are recognized in the DB Report 2018:

      a. improved minority investor protection, by making it easier to sue directors in case of prejudicial
          transactions with interested parties;
      b. improved transparency of the land registration process, by publishing online the fee schedule and list
          of documents necessary to complete any property registration in Karachi;
      c. improved starting-a-business arrangements, achieved by replacing the need to obtain a digital
         signature for company incorporation with a less costly personal identiﬁcation number; and
      d. importing and exporting (trading across borders) made easier through a new container terminal and
          enhanced customs platform for electronic document submission.

     The DB Report 2018 shows that Pakistan has made further progress in improving its business regulations
     over last year. But the pace of reforms is slower than regional and global competitors. Economies that
     have substantially improved their DB performance ensured highest level commitment and leadership as
     well as robust coordination between national and provincial authorities to drive such investment climate
     reforms. These factors can greatly beneﬁt Pakistan in strengthening the existing momentum of reforms.




                           97 The  DB ranking highlights an economy's performance in business regulation relative to the performance of other
                              economies for the year concerned.
                           98
                              This score shows the average extent to which an economy's regulatory performance has progressed toward
                              international best practice against each of the 10 DB areas. It is measured on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents the
                              worst performance and 100 the best practice (frontier), and shows the distance each economy has moved toward the
                              frontier.
                           99
                              The methodology for computation of countries’ performance on the 10 DB indicators has undergone revision several
                              times during the period examined (2006-2018); as a result, the rankings on the DB index as published in respective
                              reports are not directly comparable.
                          100 The 10 economies showing the most notable improvements in DB 2017 were: Brunei Darussalam, Kazakhstan,
                              Kenya, Belarus, Indonesia, Serbia, Georgia, Pakistan, the UAE, and Bahrain.

                       annually through to 2025. Meanwhile, employment has been growing at a slower rate
                       since 2008, with new job creation unable to keep up with labor force growth. Economic
                       development requires both accelerated growth enabling the accumulation of capital and the
                       enhancement of human capital among the workforce to be productive in the labor market.
                       Pakistan's human development base is poor. Some positive signs are starting to emerge
                       in human development indicators, but much more needs to be done to increase and
                       consolidate these gains.

School participation   Although only 4 out of 10 children in the pre-primary age group (aged 4–5) are enrolled
in early years is      in school, this number has increased by 7 percentage points for boys and 6 percentage
increasing…            points for girls since 2010.103 It is worth noting that school participation for this age
                       cohort is low even among the richest wealth quintile – with only 69 percent of children
                       enrolled in school. School participation in the early years is essential to ensure that
                       children are off to the right start, and pre-school participation is fundamental for school
                       preparedness (see Indicator 1 in Annex 1).

                       age cohort. All the provinces have experienced an increase in SPR for 6–10 year olds,
                       with the largest gains in school participation taking place in Balochistan and KP over
                       this period. Punjab has the highest proportion of children enrolled in school (83
                       percent), followed by KP (80 percent).104 In the 11–15 age cohort, KP has the highest
                       share of children enrolled in school, with a 6 percentage point increase in school
                       participation since 2010. School participation for 11–15 year olds in Sindh has remained
                       unchanged since 2010 (see Indicator 2 and 3 in Annex 1).

                       for women aged 15–49 years (from 221 to 178 during the same period). KP has

                       lowest in Balochistan – less than 38 percent (see Indicator 6 in Annex 1).

                           available for some provinces: in Punjab, the SPR for children aged 5–9, derived from the Nielsen household survey
                           data, is reported as 90 percent as per the latest round in January 2017. In 2014, the SPR for children aged 5–9 in
                           Punjab, based on the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and PSLM, was 81 and 80 percent, respectively, while
                           the Nielsen SPR ﬁgure for 2014 was 89 percent. In Sindh, the SPR for children aged 5–9 in 2014 was 63 percent as
                           reported by the MICS and 62 percent according to the PSLM.

                      declined in more recent years. Between 2010 and 2013, the shared prosperity premium –
                      the difference between the growth in average consumption of the bottom 40 percent
                      of the distribution and the distribution average – was negative, indicating an uptick in
                      inequality. Similar patterns emerge when looking at changes in the distribution of
                      consumption in each province. The consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent of

                       male participation in the labor force is approximately 82 percent, while female
                       participation remains very low at 25 percent 112 (see Indicator 17 in Annex 1).

…and women's           Gaps in women's access to ﬁnance in Pakistan are still very large. Gender discriminatory

                       enterprise (SME) loans. Studies indicate that 50–70 percent of the loans made to female
                       clients may be used by their male relatives. Less than 5 percent of women have bank
                       accounts and 2 percent of women use digital ﬁnancial services. It is vital to reduce the
                       barriers that women entrepreneurs, including women involved in agriculture, face in
                       access to ﬁnance and digital ﬁnancing to enhance women's economic empowerment

                       category of women in ministerial positions.113 The adolescent fertility rate is declining
                       gradually, but will require concerted multi-sector efforts and improvements in social
                       norms if it is to fall further. The maternal mortality ratio has also fallen since 2010 and
                       stands at 178 per 100,000 live births, calculated for women aged 15–49 in 2015. This can
                       be attributed, in part, to women's improved access to birth attendants and an increase in
                       prenatal consultations in the country. However, provincial variations are stark (see
                       Indicator 16 and 18 through 20 in Annex 1).



 The Way Forward

Human capital          Human development is a lifelong process – beginning from early childhood
accumulation is a      development (through the right nutrition, stimulation, and parenting) and
key driver of growth   encompassing formal learning (early childhood education, schools, training institutions,
                       universities); non-formal learning (apprenticeships, on-the-job training, second-chance
                       education 114 ); labor intermediation services; and entrepreneurship and innovation.
                       Further, it requires a healthy and well-nourished population. In moving forward, it is
                       essential for Pakistan to focus on policies and interventions that can improve human
                       development indicators quickly.

  a. The State of Entrepreneurship in Pakistan

Self-employment                  More than a third of those participating in the labor force are self-employed (own-
and entrepreneurship             account workers and employers) and every second household owns a small business
provide livelihood               (informal household enterprises). 116 These household enterprises employ family
opportunities to a               workers, many of whom are unpaid.117A higher share of rural males are involved in self-
large share of the               employment in agriculture, while a higher share of urban males are involved in self-
workforce                        employment in non-agriculture sector. Women, on the other hand, are grossly
                                 underrepresented in self-employment, whether in agriculture or non-agriculture, and
                                 overrepresented among unpaid family workers, pointing to the signiﬁcant constraints
                                 to female entrepreneurship. Youth also appear to face additional challenges: the share
                                 of self-employed youth (aged 15–24 years) is 18 percent compared to 41 percent for
                                 adults.

Most                             The share of 'growth-oriented' entrepreneurship is still low. Growth-oriented
entrepreneurship                 entrepreneurship, deﬁned as businesses with the potential to grow and generate
is driven by                     employment, contrasts with 'necessity' entrepreneurship, which provides livelihoods to
necessity rather                 those who opt for self-employment for lack of other opportunities and do not
than opportunity                 necessarily have the skills or aspirations to grow their business. While there is no perfect
                                 metric for deﬁning growth entrepreneurs vis-à-vis necessity entrepreneurs, only 1
                                 percent of the employed are employers, e.g., those entrepreneurs who employ others
                                 (Figure 25). This share is only slightly higher in urban areas (3 percent). Women
                                 represent just 2 percent of all employers – a negligible share – and only 14 percent of
                                 own-account workers (Figure 26).

                                       working females (LFS FY15).

Opportunity                             Employers are very different from own-account workers in many respects, with
entrepreneurs tend                      different needs. Controlling for other characteristics, employers tend to be more
to be more educated                     educated than own-account workers and even more so than wage workers (Figure 27).
and more likely to                      They also tend to be older than those who are self-employed without employees, which

formal sector                           capital requirements for setting up a business which, in the presence of limited access to
                                        credit, only better-educated and older individuals may be able to accumulate. Employers
                                        are more likely to work in manufacturing and services, as opposed to own-account
                                        workers, almost half of whom work in agriculture (Figure 28). Employers are also
                                        more likely to operate in the formal sector: 44 percent of employers report having
                                        written accounts, relative to only 12 percent of own-account workers.

Pakistan's formal              The low prevalence of employers among the self-employed is consistent with the low
private sector is              entry of ﬁrms, especially in the formal private sector, which is very small, accounting
quite small…                   for only 6 percent of all employed. Entry into the formal private sector appears to be
                               limited, with just 4,830 new limited liability companies established in 2014. This
                               corresponds to a rate of just 0.04 new companies per 100,000 people – the lowest
                               among comparator countries (Figure 29). The peak entry rate was achieved in 2006 at
                               the height of economic growth and structural reforms, but has dropped dramatically in
                               the years that followed and not fully recovered since 2009 (Figure 30). While this
                               statistic underestimates entry by considering only formal companies, it nevertheless
                               points to signiﬁcant barriers to growth-oriented entrepreneurship – the kind that can
                               provide more and better employment opportunities to a growing workforce.

…with signiﬁcant               There are signiﬁcant barriers to growth for SMEs. While information on private sector
 barriers facing               ﬁrms in Pakistan is very limited, the existing data suggests that there are substantial
growth-oriented                constraints to the ability of entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. In the
entrepreneurship…              manufacturing sector, for which data tends to be more easily available and more
                               reliable, the transition matrices indicate that very few ﬁrms are able to grow (Table 10).
                               Almost all (99 percent) small ﬁrms with fewer than 20 employees are unable to increase
                               employment within the ﬁrst 10 years of operation and 54 percent remain in this
                               category even after. While small and young ﬁrms may be underrepresented in this data,
                               the results suggest that, even in formal manufacturing, there is very little growth in the
                               SME sector.

…as reﬂected in                Pakistan's low ranking on the DB index suggests that the lack of entry and dynamism
the deteriorating              among SMEs is driven by deﬁciencies in the investment climate. Moreover, its ranking
DB rankings of                 against DB indicators has fallen substantially in recent years. As of 2006, Pakistan's
the country                    business climate was considered generally more favorable than those of India,
                               Indonesia, Turkey, or Vietnam, but the most recent rankings suggest that deﬁciencies in
                               Pakistan's investment climate now inhibit ﬁrm growth – not just more than in any of
                               these four countries, but (with a ranking of 147 out of 190 economies) also in most of
                               the world (Figure 31). Of the 10 constituent indices that determine the overall ranking,
                               Pakistan scores relatively well in protecting minority investors, getting credit, and
                               resolving insolvency, but falls behind in starting a business, dealing with construction
                               permits, getting electricity, registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders,
                               and enforcing contracts.

                                   thereby often inhibited from operating businesses outside their homes, which means

sufﬁcient jobs for     a bigger role in meeting these challenges: through more productive self-employment, a
a growing labor        more vibrant SME sector, and greater opportunities for women and youth. The
force                  challenge is to help those self-employed or potential entrepreneurs who aspire to grow
                       by helping them overcome the barriers to entry and subsequent growth. The SME
                       sector also needs support to address barriers to growth. Some of the current self-
                       employed could beneﬁt from comprehensive entrepreneurship or personal initiative
                       training121as well as access to ﬁnance to improve the productivity of their activities and
                       earnings. At least some may be better off if they had other job opportunities, including
                       in the wage sector, and could beneﬁt from complementary support to access those jobs.
                       Women and youth face additional constraints that require tailored solutions and
                       support. New and existing ﬁrms could beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from an improved business
                       environment and overall investment climate.

 2. Pakistan's Startup Ecosystem: A 360-Degree Analysis

Startups have the    Startups are an important aspect of opportunity entrepreneurship, which contributes
potential to         globally to job creation and economic growth, introduces innovation, and addresses key
stimulate job        market gaps. Studies ﬁnd that opportunity entrepreneurs who are part of the formal
creation, drive      economy are more likely to grow their businesses faster, hire more people, and ﬁll
innovation, and      market gaps with their innovations 122 than necessity entrepreneurs. 'Startups', or
contribute to        businesses in their ﬁrst stage of operations, are an important component of
growth...            opportunity entrepreneurship because they can introduce new, innovative, and
                     potentially high-growth ideas into the market. Well-known companies such as
                     Facebook, Uber, Google, and Airbnb were once startups that introduced ideas with the
                     potential to disrupt various industries. However, because the global failure rate of early-
                     stage businesses is quite high (in Silicon Valley, 9 out of 10 startups fail123 ), it is critical to
                     equip startups with the support they need to grow and become larger and more
                     established businesses that are engines for job creation and economic growth.

…and a healthy       A strong startup 'ecosystem' plays a critical role in determining the success of startup
ecosystem can        businesses. While nascent businesses, i.e., 'startups', may not have an immediate impact
improve their        on job creation, market gaps, and the economy, the provision of ﬁnancial, business, and
probability of       policy support to entrepreneurs can improve their survival and enable their transition to
success              more established high-growth ﬁrms. The players and factors that make up such support
                     – incubators, accelerators, public policy, human capital, investors – are referred to as the
                     entrepreneurship 'ecosystem'. The health of such an ecosystem correlates to better
                     success outcomes for startups, their growth, and subsequent impact on the economy.
                     While different frameworks have been used to evaluate the strength and 'health' of a
                     startup ecosystem, three parameters are commonly considered to be key: 'support',
                     'ﬁnance' and 'policy'.124 If a startup space performs well in these domains, the ecosystem
                     is considered healthy or more conducive to the growth of startups. A strong
                     entrepreneurial ecosystem, for example, would be South Korea, which has become a
                     leader in patent activity, boasts the highest broadband activity in the world, and provides
                     strong policy support for businesses in the country.125 The strength of this ecosystem is
                     a major reason that South Korea continues to be ranked ﬁrst in the world on the
                     Bloomberg global innovation index.126

…and is dominated      Startup entrepreneurs in Pakistan can be characterized as young and technology-
by young               enabled. Studies ﬁnd that entrepreneurs are increasingly more global – spread across
entrepreneurs          both developed and developing economies – but are also increasingly young, with
interested in          nearly half of all entrepreneurs globally being between 25 and 44.128 This trend is even
leveraging             more prevalent in emerging market countries experiencing a youth bulge, such as
technology             Pakistan. This youth demographic is also increasingly connected. In Pakistan, Internet
                       penetration overall has increased from 10 percent in 2012 to 17.8 percent in 2016. As of
                       March 2017, the number of annual cellular subscribers is more than 139 million
                       (approximately 67 percent penetration) 129 and 17 million new unique subscribers will be
                       added by 2020.130 These statistics, coupled with the fact that the country's youth
                       unemployment rate is 10.8 percent,131 mean that Pakistan's population is not only
                       disproportionately young, but is also more connected, particularly via mobile
                       telephones, and seeks to create opportunities for itself. This is reﬂected in the country's
                       startup ecosystem, which is dominated by young entrepreneurs building technology-
                       enabled solutions.

More players do        While the increased activity since 2012 is encouraging, more players does not always
not always translate   mean better programs or outcomes, with some initiatives failing to create value for
into high-quality      entrepreneurs. Standardized monitoring and evaluation guidelines and impact
and appropriate        measurements are critical as the ecosystem continues to grow. For example, while
support for startups   incubation centers may measure success by the number of graduates, this merely
                       focuses on an output and does not necessarily imply that the business is more equipped
                       to survive once the program ends. Incubators and accelerators need to measure impact
                       and success by outcome indicators such as the average percentage revenue growth of a
                       company, the amount of funding raised, and the number of startups that continue to be
                       operational after they leave a support program. These programs need to continue
                       strengthening their curriculum and offerings to improve their outcomes and provide
                       value to startups.

large cities           The strength of an entrepreneurial ecosystem is also measured by how inclusive its
                       programs and support are. There is, therefore, a need to expand support, launch
                       initiatives, and build the capacity of young entrepreneurs in other urban areas of the
                       country that have a large number of universities and technical schools, such as

                              ecosystems. In a survey conducted by Invest2Innovate in 2014, 84 percent of
                              respondents said it was either 'difﬁcult' or 'somewhat difﬁcult' to raise investment for
                              startups (Figure 35). Issues such as double and triple books and the lack of industry-

                              choose to invest in businesses that are at a slightly later stage versus startups. The
                              regulatory challenges and risk perception of Pakistan also dissuade international
                              investors from entering the market. For example, all foreign investors and shareholders
                              must obtain approval from Pakistan's Ministry of Interior prior to investing – an
                              arduous process that can take upward of six months – and apply for a Proceeds

                              These barriers and associated risks have exacerbated the early-stage capital gap in the
                              country, with many startups struggling to raise investment that would allow them to
                              grow their businesses.

 3. Catalyzing Women's Growth Entrepreneurship in Pakistan's
    Cities: Data from Karachi and Lahore
Enabling women's        Pakistan has the lowest rate of women's entrepreneurship in the world – only 1 percent

enter the labor force   own businesses can play an important role in boosting growth, creating jobs, and
                        encouraging more women to enter the workforce.140 This is particularly relevant in the
                        case of Pakistan where more than 2 million people are expected to join the labor force
                        every year over the next 20 years with 1 million women expected to join the labor force
                        every three years 141 – thereby accentuating the need to stimulate entrepreneurship that
                        can provide labor force entrants with viable job opportunities.

In Pakistan,            Gender disparities in entrepreneurship are stark in Pakistan. According to the 2012
however, women’s        Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Women's Entrepreneurship Report (the last
entrepreneurship        GEM gender report to include Pakistan), women are about 60 percent less likely to

                        themselves capable of starting a business compared to 61 percent of men. This
                        situation persists despite the relatively high participation of women in higher education
                        in Pakistan, with more than 45 percent of tertiary students being women.142 Moreover,
                        72 percent of the women who engage in entrepreneurship have done so due to
                        'necessity' motivations 143 compared to 52 percent of men. This is much larger than the
                        regional ﬁgure, where 43 percent of women report 'necessity' motivations. Women are
                        almost three times less likely to know an entrepreneur compared to men,144 pointing to a
                        glaring disparity in women's networks and, consequently, their ability to gain access to
                        information and business networks – considered crucial for entrepreneurial success.
                        Women entrepreneurs also tend to have smaller businesses, with 89 percent of new
                        women-led businesses reporting no employees compared to 26 percent of the
                        businesses led by men. Even among established businesses,145 48 percent of women-led
                        businesses have no employees compared to 24 percent led by men.

…due to the             The gender disparity in entrepreneurship is not surprising when one considers the

                    in 2015 and 2016 respectively. The objective was to better understand the

Even in             The city-wide survey in Karachi ﬁnds that the entrepreneurship rate is very low among
metropolises such   women and there is signiﬁcant geographic variation in the rates across the city. As
as Karachi and      Figure 36 illustrates, women's entrepreneurial activities vary signiﬁcantly across

own business        Moreover, women-led businesses are concentrated in the services sector (e.g., beauty,
                    business support), with around 66 percent of the women-owned businesses in the
                    sample located in this sector. About 10 percent operate in the retail/sales sector. The
                    remaining 24 percent are in manufacturing. On average, 5 percent of women are
                    engaged in entrepreneurship of some kind, but only 3.2 percent ﬁt the proxy criteria for
                    growth-potential entrepreneurs (in business for at least 18 months and employing two
                    full time employees).




                    148   The methodology used in both city surveys was similar, but not identical. In total, 626 interviews were conducted in
                          Karachi in 2015 and 423 interviews were conducted in Lahore in 2016/17, with both surveys seeking to survey a
                          representative stratiﬁed sample of women entrepreneurs from the various districts and towns of Karachi and Lahore,
                          using 1998 census information. The survey was administered in Karachi to women entrepreneurs already in business
                          for a minimum of 18 months and employing at least two full-time employees, while in Lahore the survey was
                          administered to women entrepreneurs in business for a minimum of 12 months. Both surveys employed additional
                          sampling strategies to account for security considerations, the growth and change of both cities since the 1998 census,
                          and the low incidence of women's entrepreneurship experienced (2.72 percent in Lahore, 5 percent in Karachi, with
                          even lower rates emerging when factoring in the additional respondent selection criteria). Despite these
                          methodological challenges, the survey provides revealing information about the characteristics and challenges of
                          growth-potential women entrepreneurs in Pakistan's two largest cities.

Women-owned                      The rate of women's entrepreneurship is lower in Lahore, at 2.72 percent. Almost three
businesses are                   quarters of the surveyed entrepreneurs are concentrated in education, salons, and
concentrated in                  apparel. Within the education sector, home-based tuition centers and medium-to-large
traditional sectors              schools are most prominent, with an average of four employees, followed by beauty
associated with                  salons, which tend to be smaller with an average of two employees. The apparel sector
women…                           constitutes 18 percent of the sample and the primary motivation to enter the sector is
                                 the ability to earn while working from home. Overall, services far outweigh 'buying and
                                 selling' and 'retail', with over 75 percent of Lahore’s female entrepreneurs in this
                                 category.

                    degree. Only 7 percent of respondents in Lahore had no formal education, or primary
                    and secondary schooling. This result contrasts with the overall educational attainment
                    levels in Pakistan: according to the Barro-Lee educational attainment database 149 , 59.2
                    percent of women over 15 in Pakistan have no formal education, 11.2 percent have
                    primary education, 14.6 percent have secondary education, and 3.5 percent have
                    attained tertiary education.150 The data also shows that most women in both cities have
                    little work or business experience before starting their businesses and that gaining
                    independence and entrepreneurial motivation are important reasons for starting a
                    business.

Encouragingly,      Women entrepreneurs in both cities follow some management practices, but there are
basic management    other practices that are not followed widely. The Karachi survey reveals that best
practices are in    managerial practices are far from being adopted, and both the quality of managerial
place in such       practices and education levels are strong predictors of business performance in the
businesses…         sample. The Karachi and Lahore entrepreneurs in the sample tended to follow good
                    bookkeeping practices, including records of sales (79 percent Karachi, 94 percent
                    Lahore) and of what is owed (71 percent Karachi, 94 percent Lahore); examined and
                    assessed their business at least monthly (70 percent Karachi, 75 percent Lahore); and
                    had business plans (54 percent Karachi, 89 percent Lahore). There is room for
                    improvement in several other commonly regarded good practices, such as keeping
                    good documentation appropriate for loan applications (52 percent Karachi, 19 percent
                    Lahore), gathering information on competitors' prices (12 percent in Karachi, 8
                    percent in Lahore), implementing special offers (15 percent in Karachi, 10 percent in
                    Lahore), and using formal accountancy services (11 percent Karachi, 8 percent
                    Lahore).

…but women          However, the women entrepreneurs surveyed lacked autonomy. Entrepreneurial
entrepreneurs       attitudes such as self-efﬁcacy, autonomy, and self-conﬁdence are crucial aspects of
often lack          entrepreneurial success. The survey reveals that lack of autonomy does not emerge in
autonomy            terms of the time available for the business, but in the choice of business premises
                    (probably because about 61 percent of the Karachi respondents and 80 percent of the
                    Lahore respondents had businesses located at home) and, above all, in the ability to
                    make key business decisions (for example, 80 percent of the respondents in the Karachi
                    services sector required permission from their families to start a business, as did 85
                    percent of respondents in Lahore). However, a related dimension of lack of autonomy
                    is heavy family involvement in the business (for example, around two thirds of Karachi
                    women, 65 percent in manufacturing and 70 percent in other sectors, had family
                    support to start their businesses). This limited autonomy explains differences in ﬁrm
                    performance, with the need for family permission negatively correlated with business
                    performance (sales and employment). In Lahore, family involvement had the positive
                    element of translating into tangible ﬁnancial support that women entrepreneurs
                    received from family and friends, with nearly 30 percent borrowing money from family
                    and friends. However, this presumably is accompanied by the ability of lenders to
                    interfere in the operation of the business.

Most women start    Most entrepreneurs appear to have 'necessity' aspirations or a mixture of both
a business out of   'necessity' and 'opportunity' aspirations, although these differing motivations do not
necessity rather    seem to affect ﬁrm performance. In Lahore, almost 80 percent cited income generation
than opportunity…   as their primary motivation for starting a business (potentially implying necessity

                              motivations). Only 19 percent cited the desire to be independent or to capitalize on
                              business opportunities as the impetus for starting a business. The most commonly cited
                              reason for engaging in the current business were its perceived proﬁtability, followed by
                              the desire to work from home, and the availability of business opportunities. This
                              potentially implies that, even though women-led businesses are concentrated in the
                              typically low-productivity services sector, women entrepreneurs perceive these as being
                              high-proﬁtability ventures – pointing to an information gap.

…but they remain              Women entrepreneurs in both cities are largely informal, which undermines their
informal                      potential to grow, and tend to operate in isolation from associations or chambers of
                              commerce. For example, 89 percent of women-owned businesses in Lahore were not
                              registered with any ofﬁcial authority.

…and struggle to              Access to ﬁnance and social constraints were identiﬁed as the main challenges for
access appropriate            women entrepreneurs in Karachi and Lahore. As Figure 37 illustrates, social
ﬁnancial services             constraints, including family restrictions and domestic obligations, were identiﬁed as
                              the main constraints by most Karachi women,151 followed by access to ﬁnance. A
                              signiﬁcant proportion of entrepreneurs found access to ﬁnance to be the main
                              constraint to their business and had never applied for credit. Family loans were the most
                              common source of business ﬁnance. Figures 38 and 39 illustrate the situation in
                              Lahore, where lack of ﬁnance also dominates as a constraint (respondents were asked
                              to identify three main constraints), followed by family responsibilities and ﬁnding new
                              markets. This is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding, given Karachi and Lahore's status as the largest
                              commercial centers in the country, where presumably there would be greater availability
                              of ﬁnance and a culture more open to women's entrepreneurial activities. These
                              challenges are likely to be more intense in smaller urban centers.

  b. Looking Ahead: How Can Pakistani Women Entrepreneurs
     Best Be Supported?

Tailored approaches                     What is of concern is that, even in the largest commercial centers of the country,
are required to ensure                  entrepreneurship rates remain low among women. This implies that not many women
that programs for                       enter entrepreneurship despite the relatively high proportion of women in higher
women entrepreneurs                     education. Bringing more women toward entrepreneurship, therefore, is a key area of
meet their needs                        focus. This data, along with program implementation experience from Pakistan and
                                        elsewhere, suggests some key areas for future support delivered to women
                                        entrepreneurs:


                                                       . Improving the business-enabling environment for women is key
                                                         to incentivizing their participation in entrepreneurship and their
                                                         economic participation more generally. Also, legislation to make
                                                         work places safe and policies and programs to boost women’s access to
                                                         infrastructure, like public transport, improves the overall conditions for
                                                         women’s economic participation.

                                                   ii. Peer networking and learning is the most useful form of support,
                                                       according to women entrepreneurs. Women entrepreneurs report
                                                       isolation from peers and mainstream business networks, which directly
                                                       affects their access to information, markets, and growth opportunities.

                        iii. Women's entrepreneurship support programs in Pakistan need to
                             enhance the managerial capacity of participants. As the baseline
                             surveys show, management practices in women-led enterprises have
                             considerable room for improvement. High-quality training curricula,
                             leveraging easily accessible delivery channels (in-class and/or digital), is
                             key to scaled-up capacity building.

                         iv. Support strategies to enhance women's autonomy and reduce
                             social constraints need to be an explicit focus. With lack of
                             autonomy being a consistent characteristic of women's reported
                             interactions, from when and where to start a business to the time
                             allocated to business activities and growth planning, women
                             entrepreneurs are forced to navigate complex, competing demands on
                             their time. In Pakistan, women's economic participation and role in
                             public life is circumscribed by norms that restrict their mobility and
                             access to male-dominated spaces (such as markets and trading places).
                             Opening up these places to women's role and presence requires
                             facilitating networks and mentoring. Social norms that constrain
                             women will take longer to change and increasing women's domestic
                             autonomy is likely to be an iterative, incremental process, helped along
                             by strategies that engage with communities, families, and men. These
                             strategies may potentially include public awareness campaigns to
                             positively inﬂuence social norms related to women’s access to public
                             spaces such as transportation; decision making roles; and unpaid care
                             work.

                         v. The role of ﬁnance needs to be better understood and designed in
                            a way that best suits women. While access to ﬁnance was one of the
                            most commonly cited challenges among women entrepreneurs in the
                            sample, they did not consider formal ﬁnance to be a viable option, given
                            their aversion to paying interest, lack of knowledge about the
                            implications of taking on debt, and the perception that their ﬁnancing
                            needs were well met by personal sources such as family and friends.
                            Financial products more closely tailored to the needs of women
                            entrepreneurs may thus be needed.

                         vi. Customizing entrepreneurship support programs for women.
                             First, one of the main challenges of existing support programs is to
                             screen 'necessity' from 'opportunity' entrepreneurs. The results from
                             the surveys suggest that managerial practices and education can be
                             important predictors of opportunity entrepreneurship among women.
                             Second, outreach is a problem. Most women-led businesses do not
                             belong to any networks and operate in isolation. Even where groups
                             exist, such as the Women's Chambers of Commerce, they are perceived
                             as inhospitable by most women entrepreneurs. The creation of
                             women's networks, not only for participants to programs, but more
                             generally, such as via chambers, accelerators, SME development

                           agencies, trade associations and universities, needs to be a priority.
                           Third, trainings need to move beyond technical issues and focus on
                           managerial practices and soft skills. Fourth, and most important, the
                           content of these programs needs to aim, in addition to improving the
                           quality of managerial practices, at increasing the autonomy of women
                           in business decision-making, possibly by including male and older
                           family members in programs to address social norms around control
                           over assets and decision-making.

 4. Export Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation

Pakistan's trade    Trade has not been fully leveraged to catalyze growth in Pakistan. Over the period
performance since   2005–16, Pakistan's exports of goods rose from US$16.05 billion to US$20.4 billion –
2000 has been       an increase of only 27.3 percent compared to an increase of 276 percent in Bangladesh,
disappointing…      445 percent in Vietnam, and 165 percent in India. Similarly, Pakistan's trade-to-GDP
                    (T/GDP) ratio was close to that of Bangladesh at 28.1 percent in 2000. Over the past
                    decade, Bangladesh's T/GDP ratio has increased to 42.1 percent, while Pakistan's
                    T/GDP has remained almost unchanged at 28.1 percent. In the last six years alone
                    (FY11–17), export earnings have declined by approximately 20 percent.

…as exports have    Pakistan's poor trade performance in recent years is an outcome of diminishing export
lost their          competitiveness. Export competitiveness, as indicated by the country's market share of
competitiveness     global exports, has been declining over the years, while market shares of peer
                    economies such as Malaysia, Mexico, and Thailand have doubled. Pakistan has lost 1.5
                    percent annually in export market share over the past decade. This number is put in
                    perspective when broken down by markets and products. Over the period 2013–15,
                    Pakistan only managed to increase its export share in 9 out of its 20 biggest export
                    markets. World exports to China dropped by 5.4 percent over the period 2013–15, while
                    Pakistan's exports to China dropped by a higher rate of almost 10 percent. Similarly,
                    world exports to the UAE dropped by 2.9 percent over the period 2013–15, while
                    Pakistan's exports dropped by 20.2 percent. Pakistan's higher 'decay' rate,153 as opposed
                    to the world decay rate for China and the UAE, points to the existence of barriers to
                    trade that have hindered growth in exports.

Entrepreneurship    Declining export competitiveness has discouraged entrepreneurship and innovation in
and innovation in   the export sector, as evident from Pakistan's export dynamics in recent years. The
export-oriented     World Bank Group's Enterprise Survey for 2013 shows that trade policy, trade
sectors have been   facilitation, logistics and infrastructure, and the broader investment climate, all of
dampened…           which are parameters for gauging export competitiveness, are not homogeneous in
                    their impact when impact is disaggregated by ﬁrm size. The Enterprise Survey shows
                    that only 5.5 percent of ﬁrms classiﬁed as small (5–19 employees) directly export their
                    output as opposed to 36.6 percent of large ﬁrms (100+ employees). While this disparity
                    might be attributed to fundamental differences in outward orientation grounded in ﬁrm
                    size, the disparity holds in comparison to other countries and regions. Globally, an
                    average of 8 percent of all small ﬁrms directly export their output. Similarly, only 12.3
                    percent of small ﬁrms in Pakistan used material/inputs or supplies of foreign origin in
                    their production processes as opposed to a global average of 55 percent, indicating
                    barriers and informational asymmetries that prevent small ﬁrms from accessing quality
                    inputs at globally competitive prices. This number is in sharp contrast to that of large
                    ﬁrms in Pakistan, 44.9 percent of which use foreign inputs. Pakistan's export base and
                    its evolution – or lack thereof – over the years also alludes to dampened
                    entrepreneurship and innovation. Its exports are heavily dependent on intensive
                    margins, and lack sophistication and dynamism, while exporters have difﬁculty
                    retaining export relationships.

…and the                                   Pakistan's export basket is relatively concentrated in terms of both products and
country's export                           markets, leaving the country exposed to price- and partner-speciﬁc shocks (Figures 40
basket remains                             and 41). Just one product category, cotton manufactures, has over the past decade
undiversiﬁed                               accounted for approximately 55 percent of Pakistan's export basket. Its three largest
                                           exports – cotton manufactures, leather, and rice – together amount to over 70 percent
                                           of total exports. This share has remained unchanged for over a decade. Pakistan's
                                           export market base and penetration, much like its product base, has also remained
                                           stagnant over the past decade. Five markets have historically accounted for over 60
                                           percent of Pakistan's exports. Geographically, the European Union and the US
                                           represent the most important destinations of Pakistani exports, with the US absorbing
                                           17 percent and the European Union 22 percent of all exports.

intensive margins                          from deepening existing relationships – along intensive margins. During 2010–15,
                                           growth along extensive margins accounted for only 18.4 percent of growth along

                         Pakistan's exporters account for 45 percent of the country's exports. In contrast,
                         smaller ﬁrms rely primarily on extensive margins. This reliance is reﬂected in the higher
                         turnover among ﬁrms with lower export values. Each year, 16–37 percent of ﬁrms exit
                         and 19–37 percent enter the export market. Most of the churning in the market takes
                         place at the lower end of the export value distribution; similarly, most of the churning

                         advantage. Of the 53 textile export relationships in 2010, only 27 remained in 2015.

 What is Needed to Revive Export Competitiveness?

Holistic reforms     Reviving export competitiveness – and therefore dynamism, sophistication, and
are required…        entrepreneurship and innovation – requires reforms in three areas: (i) trade policy; (ii)
                     trade facilitation, logistics, and infrastructure; and (iii) the overarching investment
                     climate.

…starting from       Pakistan needs to commit to a simple and transparent tariff structure with low average
the tariff regime…   tariffs, minimum dispersion, and minimal use of para-tariffs. Its current tariff policy
                     has been shaped more by revenue and protectionist considerations than long-term
                     competitiveness-enhancing measures. Pakistan's tariffs are almost twice as high as the
                     world average and three times higher than those in Southeast Asia. Tariff rates in
                     Pakistan are also considerably higher than in other countries in South Asia. Pakistan's
                     simple average tariff rate was 13.6 percent in 2014, compared to an average of 11.7
                     percent in South Asia – this measure excludes the impact of para-tariffs such as
                     regulatory duties. Pakistan also imposes high import duties on intermediate inputs and
                     raw materials used by exporters, thereby compromising the competitiveness of its
                     exports. High tariffs on imports for exports (for example, intermediates) and high tariff
                     rate differentials between primary, intermediate, and consumer goods have led to rising
                     production costs, which has eroded processing margins. High tariff differentials and
                     other complexity-enhancing ad-hoc policy measures are especially harmful to smaller
                     companies: not only do they add to the cost of doing business, but they also introduce
                     uncertainty.

…a differentiated    Trade policy needs to be sensitized to the differences in ﬁrms' requirements by size,
trade policy that    location, and sector. Exemptions granted to importers and exporters through different
accounts for the     government schemes shed light on the need for disaggregating policy measures based
requirements of      on speciﬁc ﬁrm characteristics. Although duty exemptions reduce the effective
different ﬁrm        customs duty paid by exporters, they do not beneﬁt all ﬁrms in Pakistan and their
categories…          impact is skewed toward larger ﬁrms. Exporters need to import their own intermediate
                     inputs to beneﬁt from the main customs duty exemptions; less than a third of exporters
                     (31 percent) did so in FY16. Furthermore, smaller exporters are less likely to import.
                     Only 19.2 percent of micro-exporters and 31.5 percent of small exporters imported
                     goods and services, compared to 84.1 percent of large ﬁrms in FY16. Larger ﬁrms have
                     also beneﬁted the most from duty exemption schemes. The top 100 ﬁrms in Pakistan
                     accounted for roughly three quarters of duty-exempted value, and only ﬁve ﬁrms
                     accounted for about a third of that total.

…investment in       Pakistan needs to invest in its logistics and transportation infrastructure to improve
infrastructure to    trade facilitation. Reducing trade costs, upgrading service quality, and improving
reduce costs and     connectivity between domestic and foreign markets can play a decisive role in attaining
improve              export competitiveness by allowing countries to trade goods and services on a timely
connectivity…        basis and with lower transaction costs, in addition to enabling integration with global
                     value chains. Costs associated with logistics – both monetary costs and costs associated
                     with processing times – despite having fallen overall and over time, are still considerably
                     higher in Pakistan than in peer group comparators and the region. As of 2015, border
                     and documentary compliance to export from Karachi took 141 hours, compared to 20

…and broad-based     Investment climate-related constraints need to be removed to promote investment in
measures to          Pakistan's productive sectors. It has not been able to capitalize on international
improve the          investors' appetite for high-return investments in developing countries. While other
investment climate   countries in the region have used FDI as seed capital to support high-potential, high-
                     growth, and entrepreneurial industries within their export sector, Pakistan has failed to
                     draw meaningful long-term FDI to revitalize its lagging export sector. Net foreign
                     investment was negative in Pakistan in three of the last ﬁve years. Foreign investment
                     has also been more volatile compared to other countries in the region. Pakistan drew
                     US$842 million in FDI in 2015, down US$902 million from 2014 (it received US$1.7
                     billion in FDI in 2014). This is considerably lower than the US$2.1 billion drawn by
                     Bangladesh and the US$10.7 billion drawn by Vietnam in the same year. Low levels of
                     FDI, in addition to low domestic investment (as embodied in the ratio of private sector
                     investment to GDP, which has declined from a high of approximately 16 percent in
                     2006 to less than 10 percent in 2015), and limited access to ﬁnance (as per the Enterprise
                     Survey, one fourth of small ﬁrms surveyed had their recent loan applications rejected)
                     have all contributed to a decrease in the ﬁnancial capital available for entrepreneurs to
                     start a business in Pakistan.

                           Customs clearance time for small exporters is less than that for large exporters. The difference suggests that trade
                           facilitation and logistics are less of an issue for small ﬁrms as compared to trade policy, investment climate etc.
