About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                         Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Regional Technical O ce (Genio Civile)

      Under the Lazio Regional Regulation no. 2 of February 7, 2012, since January
      1, 2013, the application to obtain the seismic authorization shall be done
      online by using the so-called SITAS system. The applications delivered by
      hand are not accepted.
      The Regional O ce “Genio Civile” checks for the compliance of the project
      with the technical provisions set forth by the competent administration
      through an internal control committee and issues the seismic authorization.
      This authorization is mandatory for the building permit to be valid.


      Structural projects are randomly selected for control in the rst ten days of
      the month following application. Projects that are not selected are
      automatically authorized. However, the applicant must wait until a formal
      letter of seismic approval is received. The letter arrives approximately within
      two weeks.


      For projects selected for control, the procedure lasts at least 60 days.

      Agency : Private licensed company

      A soil test is a necessary step for development of the project. The soil
      investigation helps to determine the bearing capacity of the land, which
      helps to determine the load capability, the type and depth of foundation, in
      order to make sure to select a suitable construction technique.

  3   Obtain topographic survey of the land plot                                            15 days                  EUR 1,000

      A topographic survey of the land plot must be obtained prior to developing
      the architectural plans of the warehouse.

      Agency : Municipal Agency

      The application for a building permit is led with the Sportello Unico
      dell'Edilizia (one-stop shop). BuildCo must le proof of title of ownership to
      the property for which the building permit is requested, as well as the
      project design drawings signed by an engineer or an architect, including the
      drawings relating to electric utilities, air conditioning systems, and re
      protection devices. The SUE will also request project clearance from the Fire
      Department and from the Public Health Agency. The minimum term
      required for the issue of the building permit is 90 days (where the applicant
      has submitted all the correct documents and the competent agency has not
      asked for integration of documents and/or small variations to the project). In
      practice, if there are requests for variation/integration, the Municipality
      Agency takes more days to issue the building permit.


      The fees for the issuance of the building permit are calculated based on the
      building value and on the urbanization costs sustained by the municipality.
      The fee based on building value must be paid no later than 60 days after the
      completion of the building; the fee based on urbanization costs must be paid
      upon issuance of the building permit.                                                                                         Page 14

       The Law Decree no. 70 of May 13, 2011 has introduced the "consent by silent"
       for issuing of building permits.
       Speci cally, in case of silence by the Municipality Agency to reply within the
       deadline indicated by law, the entrepreneur is entitled to start construction
       activities (unless there are restrictions on the land/building for historical,
       landscape or cultural reasons). For complex projects, the Municipality
       Agency must reply within 150 days from the receipt of the application (such
       time does not consider any extension of time necessary for any request of
       integration or changes to the project by the competent o ce).

       Agency : Authorized Independent Engineer

       The structure tests must be performed by an engineer or an architect who
       was not directly involved in the project. In addition to the nal test on
       completed structures, the work site director must provide test results for
       the structural material used to build the structure. In the case of reinforced
       concrete, the testing must be done on three samples taken on each day that
       concrete is poured and on one sample for each steel per le used in the
       structure. The testing is based on per les traction and compression
       resistance and must be done by an authorized testing lab.

If the minimum outage time considered for SAIDI/SAIFI is over 5 minutes, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.




    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       a warehouse used for commercial purposes, sold by a company that is not in
       the construction business the cadastral tax is equal to 1% of sale price,
       according to the law 248 of 2006, and the transcription tax is equal to 3% of
       sale price. Italian VAT law applicable to commercial properties states that the
       sale of a commercial property is generally VAT exempt, unless (i) in the cases
       mandatorily provided for by the Italian tax law (ii) if the seller has elected for
       the VAT regime. In any case, the transfer of a commercial property where
       both the seller and the purchaser are Italian companies is subject to a xed
       registration tax rate. The Land registry and cadastre are 2 di erent
       databases, but managed by the same government agency since 2008-2009.
       The Land Registry has the purpose of rendering deeds enforceable towards
       all third parties. Until a deed has been registered in the Land Registry, it is
       only enforceable between the parties thereto. The Italian Land Registry
       system is based on the principle of continuity of the registrations
       ("continuità delle trascrizioni"). This means that an individual or an entity
       may sell a property only if the relative deed of purchase has been registered
       beforehand in the Land Registry.

      Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                       procedure will be converted into the “fallimento” - a liquidation procedure. The aim of the
                                       fallimento is to satisfy the creditors’ rights and to remove the insolvent enterprise from the
                                       market. The fallimento starts when the company is deemed to be insolvent. A receiver is
                                       appointed by the competent court to manage the liquidation proceedings. The receiver
                                       must collect and sell the debtor’s assets under the judge’s direction and the creditors'
                                       surveillance. The competent bankruptcy court also appoints a judge who will be entitled to
                                       direct the proceeding and to resolve upon creditor’s claims. Insolvency proceedings will not
                                       take less than 1.8 years because of the large number of procedural steps required.
                                       Additionally, due to the financial crisis, the number of insolvency cases filed in Italy has
                                       increased, which put an additional burden on the courts.
