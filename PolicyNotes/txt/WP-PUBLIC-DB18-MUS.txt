About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      It is mandatory to obtain a building sewerage clearance before requesting a
      building and land-use permit. Two sets of building plans must be submitted
      to either the Port-Louis Sewerage o ce for buildings in Port-Louis and in the
      northern parts of the island or Beau-Bassin sewerage o ce for buildings in
      upper and lower Plaines-Wilhems and the southern parts of the island.


      An acknowledgement is issued upon receipt of the documents and a
      clearance will be issued within 15 days. Since this procedure is processed in
      a di erent institution as the previous one, it can be a simultaneous one.

      The procedure of obtaining the plan approval consists of a noti cation and a
      check that all the requirements have been met, rather than an approval per
      se. Approvals from the utility companies and the Fire Department are a
      prerequisite for the building and land-use permit. Since this procedure is
      processed in a di erent institution as the previous one, it can be a
      simultaneous one.

      Agency : Local Authority (Municipality)

      As of October 1, 2006, a single permit, the building and land-use permit (BLP),
      has replaced both the development permit and the building permit. The
      authority for execution and enforcement of the Building Act and of the Town
      and Country Planning Act is the local authority of the town or district where
      the relevant establishment is to be built or the land to be developed.


      Every application for a building and land-use permit must be in accordance
      with provisions of the Building Act, the Town and Country Planning Act, and
      the Planning and Development Act of 2004. The following documents are
      required in addition to the application:                                                                                     Page 13

       neighboring constructions is less than 1 meter for one-story buildings and
       1.5 meters for two-story buildings.
       • PER/environmental impact assessment (EIA) license for scheduled
       undertakings: The PER is for small projects, while the EIA is for larger ones
       with a potential environmental impact. Neither applies to the warehouse
       assessed in the Doing Business case study.
       • All plans must be signed by the draughtsman for buildings of less than 250
       sq. m. in oor area and must include the name and address. The total oor

       sites, including the Web sites of the agencies mentioned above.

       In accordance with the Local Government Act 2011, applications for the
       building and land-use permit that are in accordance with the act and
       guidelines should be reviewed within 14 working days of the date of receipt
       of the application. Upon approval of the Executive Committee, the building
       and land use permit is issued.

       The costs associated with the application for the dual permit include an
       application fee of MUR 500, plus charges computed based on land area as
       follows:
       • MUR 10.00 per sq. m. for areas of 250 sq. m. or less
       • MUR 20.00 per sq. m. for areas ranging from 251 to 500 sq. m.

      A random inspection is carried out without any notice at any time.
      This procedure is processed at the same institution as the previous one, and
      can only be requested, upon construction is already started, for that reason
      it cannot be a simultaneous one.

      After completion of construction and before starting up business
      operations, BuildCo informs the Fire Department, which sends out
      inspectors and issues a re certi cate immediately after the inspection has
      been completed. This procedure is processed at the same institution as the

      Municipality. A clearance certi cate signed by the principal agent must be
      submitted when applying for the certi cate of compliance. The Municipality
      will then inspect the building although a representative of BuildCo does not
      need to be present. Since this procedure is processed in a di erent

Note:

If the duration and frequency of outages is 100 or less, the economy is eligible to score on the Reliability of supply and transparency
of tari index.

If the duration and frequency of outages is not available, or is over 100, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.

If the minimum outage time considered for SAIDI/SAIFI is over 5 minutes, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.




    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       Agency : Registrar General                                                                                 duty)

       The notary will deliver the signed deed + one copy of the deed to the
       Registrar-General for registration.
       The notary will pay the registration fee, the stamp duty and the transfer tax
       on behalf of the seller when applying for registration at the Registrar
       General’s o ce.


       It is now also possible to submit documents, pay fees and receive the
       registered deed online through the eRegistry system which was launched on
       30 June, 2015.

       Once stamp duty is paid, the Conservator of Mortgages will enter the
       transaction in the book and will give a Transcription Number (TN) to the
       notary. Once this TN number is available at the Registrar General, the
       property is opposable to third parties. The notary will then issue the "Copie
       authentique" to the buyer. There is a statutory time of 48 hours for the
       Registrar General to complete the transcription and give the Transcription
       Number (TN) to the notary.

       After the TN has been issued, the Land registry will verify and re-assess the
       transaction through internal processes. The Notary will subsequently pick up
       the registered deed and will keep the document for 40 years and then
       transmit it to the Chief Archivist, National Archives Department for safe
       keeping. If this time limit is not respected, there is a penalty of 50% to be
       paid.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                       Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest        registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population        secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                     In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit         only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set

                                                           Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender

                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                           largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                           second largest business city.
                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                           The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                           a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating
                                                           charge or any charge that gives BizBank a security interest over ABC’s

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding           receivership     BizBank has a floating charge on all assets of Mirage, in addition to the hotel itself as security
                                      for the loan. BizBank, in its capacity of chargee, can appoint a receiver if the charge
                                      document allows it to do so, or alternatively, make an application for the court to appoint a
                                      receiver over the assets of Mirage (Sections 185 and 186 of the Insolvency Act). Under
                                      section 204 of the Insolvency Act, BizBank, as secured creditor, will be reimbursed after
                                      payment of receiver's fees. The receiver has the power, as per section 190 of the Insolvency

                                      of the Insolvency Act). It is worth noting that liquidation is not in the interest of BizBank

                                      creditors would be paid according to their rank. BizBank would be paid 5th.

Outcome              going concern    According to the Eighth Schedule of the Insolvency Act (section 1), further to the recovery of
                                      the hotel by the receiver, the latter may sell the asset in order to reimburse Bizbank and the
                                      buyer will be able to continue operating the business.

Time (in years)      1.7              According to our estimations, it takes 20 months to complete the receivership procedure in
                                      Port Louis. The main steps are as follows: (i) The receiver will communicate its appointment
                                      through the press 7 days after its appointment and inform the regulators; (ii) The directors
                                      are required to submit to the receiver the statement of accounts of Mirage 14 days after the
                                      notice by the receiver. Within 28 days after receipt of the above statement of accounts, the
                                      receiver will submit a copy of the statement of accounts to the Director of the Insolvency
                                      Service; (iii) The receiver prepares its first report 2 months after its appointment. Then, it will
                                      submit the report to the regulator; (iv) Within 2 months after his appointment, the receiver
                                      prepares his report on the state of affairs with respect to the property in receivership; (v)
                                      Every 6 months, the receiver will prepare a further report after the first report stating the
                                      revenues and payments as well as other steps undertaken during the period; (vi) The
                                      receiver will find a buyer and negotiate the sale. It must also agree with the buyer to take
                                      over the employees; (vii) The sale of the business as a going concern will take place; (viii) At
                                      the end of the receivership, the receiver shall notify in writing to the regulator and the
                                      Director of the Insolvency Service that the receivership has ceased, not later than 10 working
                                      days after the receivership ceases.

Cost (% of           14.5             According to our estimations, the receivership procedure will cost 4,247,000 MUR (15% of the
estate)                               value of Mirage´s estate). Major expenses include: fees of lawyers (5%), fees of the receiver
                                      (5%), fees of auctioneers, accountants and other professionals (4%), and other costs –
                                      notification and publication costs, court fees – (1%).
