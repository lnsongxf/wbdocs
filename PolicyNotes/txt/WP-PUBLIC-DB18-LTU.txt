About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      the following steps are carried out by the Utility:
      - preparation of the design of the external electricity network;
      - assignment of the work order to the annual contractor. In most of the
      cases, annual contractors are selected once a year by the public tender and
      no addition procurements are carried out after the customer signs The New
      Connection Service Agreement;
      - construction work for the electricity network of AB ESO. All the necessary
      material is provided by the Utility and Customer does not need to buy any
      material for the construction of external electricity network.

      Inspection
      Agency : State Energy Inspection

      An internal inspection can be done in parallel with AB Lesto works (the
      external connection works). The customer must apply to the State Energy
      Inspection, a Division of the Ministry of Economy, and request a Certi cate of
      Completion. The customer can request the internal inspection already when
      the Construction Permit is obtained. The internal wiring is the responsibility
      of the customer and someone from the customer's party is requested to be
      present during the inspection. The State Inspection examines the
      constructed warehouse and its documentation and signs the certi cate
      “Completion of Works”.

      The meter is installed after the electricity supply agreement has been signed
      and after the utility receives the Certi cate from the State Energy Inspection
      which indicates that the internal wiring is successfully completed and that
      the utility works up to the meter are completed as well. The meter is installed
      by AB Lesto and by the same department that is doing the connection works.                                              Page 21

       building's average market value and EUR 232,000
       More than EUR 870,000 = EUR 496,70 + 0,05% di erence between building's
       average market value and 870,000, but not more than EUR 1448,10 (the
       ultimate cap fee for registration
       Average market value of land plot - registration fee:
       Up to EUR 2,900 = EUR 23.17
       From EUR 2,901 to EUR 29,000 = EUR 23.17 + 0.3% of the di erence between
       land plot's average market value and EUR 2,900
       From EUR 29,001 to EUR 290,000 = EUR 101.37 + 0.3% of the di erence
       between land plot's average market value and EUR 29,000

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                      Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest       registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population       secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                    In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit        only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set
  registry as a percentage of adult population            of legal provisions relating to the use of movable collateral.

                                                          Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating
                                                          charge or any charge that gives BizBank a security interest over ABC’s

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Outcome             piecemeal sale     Upon declaring the enterprise bankrupt and adopting a resolution to put the enterprise into
                                       liquidation by reason of bankruptcy, the court shall confirm the amount of revised claims of
                                       each creditor, the procedure of liquidation, other orders and instructions necessary for
                                       carrying out the liquidation procedure. In this stage pledged assets – the real estate - shall
                                       be sold at an auction.

Time (in years)     2.3                Mirage management will file a petition for commencement of reorganization proceedings
                                       and send a notice of it to the creditors and to the Authority of Audit, Accounting, Property
                                       valuation and Insolvency Management under the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of
                                       Lithuania. The court will decide whether to initiate reorganization proceedings within 1
                                       month of receiving the petition. Decision of the court to initiate reorganization proceedings
                                       stays all other enforcement actions against the debtor. An administrator will be appointed
                                       and creditors must submit their claims within specified period (usually 30 to 45 days). The
                                       claims must be approved by the court in order for the creditors to vote on the
                                       reorganization plan. A creditors' meeting will be held 30 days after the creditors' claims are
                                       approved, creditors will elect a creditors' committee. Mirage management must submit a
                                       reorganization plan within 6 months of the date when the decision on the opening of
                                       reorganization proceedings is made. Creditors representing at least 2/3 of the aggregate
                                       amount of certified claims must vote in favor of the plan, in order for it to be approved. If the
                                       creditors fail to approve the plan, reorganization proceedings will be terminated. After
                                       reorganization proceedings are terminated, there is no automatic conversion of
                                       proceedings into liquidation. However, BizBank will be able to petition the court to open
                                       liquidation proceedings. The court will issue a liquidation order and liquidation proceedings
                                       will commence. A bankruptcy administrator will be appointed, who must sell the assets to
                                       satisfy the creditors' claims. Immovable property must be sold at a public auction. Movable
                                       property and immovables not sold at an auction will be sold in accordance with the decision
                                       of the creditors. Claims of secured creditors have priority over all other claims, including
                                       employment and tax claims, and will be paid first from the proceedings of the sale.

Cost (% of          10.0               Major expenses will include remuneration of the administrator (around 5%), attorneys' fees
estate)                                (up to 5%), and fees of other professionals involved in the insolvency proceedings, such as
                                       accountants and assessors (up to 5%).
