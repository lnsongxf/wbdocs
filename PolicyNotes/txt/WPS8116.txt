1.     Introduction

       There is broad agreement in the literature that the stock of human capital is a key driver of
economic growth and prosperity, as well as poverty reduction. The stock of human capital is a
concept that involves not only the overall available labor force, but also skills education and health.
Thus, for the government of a country to ensure growth and economic development, it must invest
in education and health. Good health and well-being, together with quality education, are part of
the major development policy agenda as set in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
       Improving access to and demand for education and health are key policy goals for Uganda,
because the lack of a qualified and healthy labor force is a constraint to growth, inclusive growth
and poverty reduction. As pointed-out by Fox and Pimhidzai (2011), educational attainment is the
most important predictor of income and welfare in Uganda. The Government of Uganda (GoU) is
aware of this fact, and as evidence for this, education, health as well as physical infrastructure are
among the investment priorities of the National Development Plan (NDP). In line with the NDP
and in order to provide the environment for economic growth and prosperity, the GoU and its
development partners have agreed that education, health and four other sectors (namely
Agriculture; Energy; Works and Transport; Water and Sanitation) should get priority in the budget.
        Since 1997, the GoU has implemented a series of policies as well as investment in order to
improve both the supply and the demand for education and health services. On the supply side, a
set of policies has been implemented during the past decades in order to improve access. These
policies include among others building and renovation of schools and health centers, purchase of
adequate instructional materials, training, hiring and retaining teachers and health workers, drugs
policy under the national medical store, fight against teachers’ and health workers’ absenteeism,
hard to reach hard to say strategy, curriculum change, and decentralization. On the demand side, a
series of policies and actions have been implemented as well. The most notable ones include the
Universal Primary Education (UPE), the Universal Secondary Education (USE), School Feeding
programs, Tuition programs, mama kits programs, and National immunization days, among others.
Although there has been a big improvement over the past decade, all these inventions have yet to
materialize into fully satisfactory performance of these keys sectors.
        The reforms that were implemented by the government were very successful in increasing
access. Nevertheless, the supply systems were not ready to accommodate the increasing demand.
Moreover, financial and human resources have not kept pace with the increase in demand which
led to overcrowding and overstretched of physical infrastructure. As a consequence, it is believed
that the increase in access was achieved at the expenses of good quality. In recent years, quality of
service delivery has become a serious concern for all stakeholders including government and
development partners. Yet, evidence suggest that beyond simple access/attainment, the quality of
service delivery is very important for economic growth (Hanushek and Woessman, 2012).
        There is little evidence to support the policy debate on quality of service delivery in
Uganda, especially for the education and health sectors. The few available data cover the education
sectors only and are from Uwezo, the Uganda National Examination Board (UNEB) through the
National Assessment of Progress in Education (NAPE). These data already provide evidence of


                                                                                                     2
the quality deterioration. But they all lack the robustness and the specificity that is needed to
properly study quality.
        In line with this concern, and in order to fill the data gap, the World Bank jointly with the
African Economic Development Bank and the African Economic Research Consortium,
developed and conducted in 2013 an innovative survey on the quality of the education and the
health sector in Uganda: The Service Delivery Indicator (SDI) survey. The SDI survey applies a
rigorous methodology to collect robust evidence on the quality of primary education and basic
health services in a country. The availability of such survey made it possible to conduct an in-
depth study of service delivery quality in Uganda. The main report of this survey was published
by the World Bank and disseminate in Uganda widely (World Bank, 2013).
        This paper seeks to build on and extend the SDI study by further exploring issues related
to the quality of service delivery in Uganda. In particular, this paper aims at analyzing quality of
service from a poverty perspective. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the ongoing policy
debate on quality of service delivery in Uganda, especially in the education and health sectors. The
paper aims to build on the richness of the data that where collected to provide a profile of quality
of service along the welfare distribution. In addition, the paper shows the link between quality and
the user’s satisfaction profile, which allows to draw policy recommendations in terms of
community demand for results and accountability.
         This paper estimates the extent to which quality of service is positively correlated with
welfare, and satisfaction is negatively correlated with welfare in Uganda. Section 2 presents the
data sources used and the methods considered in the paper with a major focus on specific and
critical indicators (absenteeism, caseload, etc.). Section 3 looks at the quality of inputs at the school
and health center levels. Section 4 explores quality in terms of knowledge and behavior of the
workers (teachers and health workers). Section 5 looks at outcomes at the school level and how
this is correlated with teachers and school quality. Section 6 explores correlation between user’s
satisfaction, quality of services and poverty. A conclusion follows.
2.      Data

       This study draws heavily from two data sets: The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) survey
of 2013, and the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) of 2012/13. The SDI is used to
compute the indicators on the supply and quality of services. The UNHS is used to rank facilities
by welfare and to derive users’ satisfaction.
        The SDI is a survey that applies a rigorous methodology to collect robust evidence to gauge
the quality of service delivery in primary education and basic health services in a country. Focusing
on quality of service delivery, SDI surveys are standardized, allowing for data comparison across
countries as well as between regions of a country. The indicators that can be computed using this
survey can be ranked into three categories: (i) Provider competence and knowledge; (ii) Proxies
for effort; and (iii) Availability of key infrastructure and inputs. In addition, for education, the
survey captures information on service delivery outcomes, namely pupils’ knowledge.
       The SDI collects facility-based data from primary schools and health facilities. The sample
frame is the list of facilities in the country. The measurement of these indicators is based on survey
                                                                                                       3
instruments underpinned by rigorous research and embraces the latest innovations in measuring
provider competence and effort (World Bank, 2013). The sample design for the Service Delivery
Indicators is national and disaggregated by rural/urban locations and provider (education and
health) type. Tables 1 and 2 provide details on the sample size for education and health
respectively. Close to 400 schools and 400 health facilities across the country were selected and
visited. The enumerators noted the presence/absence of 3,783 teachers in the school (and also in
the classroom) during an unannounced visit to the facility; and 2,214 teachers were assessed on
knowledge of English, mathematics and pedagogy. In the health sector, in addition to noting the
presence/absence of 1,507 health workers, 736 providers were administered seven vignettes (also
called ‘patient case simulations’).
        The Uganda National Household Survey (2012/13), is a nationally representative survey
collected by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS, 2013). The UNHS employs a two-stage
sampling framework and it covers approximately 7,000 households. The socioeconomic module
provides information on household consumption, which is used to derive household welfare
indicator. Each district of the country is split into two parts: urban and rural. The average
household welfare is then attributed to the facilities in the SDI survey. Subsequently, this allows
to rank the facilities by quintile of welfare. The ultimate goal of the paper is to look at the quality
of service along the welfare distribution.
        The community module of the UNHS has a section on the availability of services in the
Local Council 1 (LC1).2 The questions in the module are as follows. First households are asked:
“Is service available to members of the LC1 (even if they must travel to use it?)” Four answer
options to choose from included: Yes, within LC1; Yes, outside LC1; No; and Not Applicable.
Next, if the service is available in the LC1 or outside the LC1 (the first two possible answers to
the previous question), households are asked six other questions: (1) “What is the name of the
provider to which community members most often go to use the service?” (this question is not used
in the analysis); (2) “What is the distance from village centre (i.e. geographical middle) to the
service?”; (3) “What is the distance from village centre to [SERVICE] in kms?” ; (4) “What is the
most common means of transport to the service?” (ten different modes of transportation are listed);
(5) “What is the time taken to get to [SERVICE] from village centre using common means of
transport? (in minutes)”; and finally (6) “How do you rate the quality of service offered by the
service?” (three grades are available: Good, Average, and Poor). In the current paper, those saying
that the quality is good are considered as satisfied with the service.

  There are six levels of Local Councils in Uganda. The lowest level is the Local Council I (LC 1 or LC I), and is
responsible for a village or, in the case of towns or cities, a neighborhood.

3.       The quality of inputs is lower in poor areas

Primary schools located in better-off areas have higher quality inputs
       The SDI survey collected information on quality of inputs in the education sector. Pupil
per classroom and the pupil to teacher ratios, teacher’s absenteeism, classroom environment,
functioning parent-teacher association (PTA), functioning School Management Committee
(SCM), and school inspection, are some of the indicators that can be derived from the survey.
        On various dimensions, quality of inputs seems to be of higher quality in better-off
locations. First, consider the pupil per classroom and the pupil to teacher ratios (figure 1 and table
3). The pupil per classroom ratio and the pupil to teacher ratio are much higher for the poorest
quintile compared to the richest. A typical classroom in the poorest quintile has 116 pupils, while
the corresponding figure for the richest quintile is 58 pupils. A teacher in the poorest quintile has
to attend to 58 pupils, while the teacher in richest quintile attends to 31 pupils. The overcrowding
of pupils in poorer areas will certainly have negative consequences on learning outcomes. Another
interesting finding is that the pupil to teacher and the pupil per classroom ratios are much higher
in public schools compared to private schools. In public schools, a classroom has 86 pupils. This
number is 35 pupils for private schools. The northern region, which also happens to be the poorest
region in Uganda, has the worst performance in terms of pupil per classroom and the pupil to
teacher ratios.
        Teacher absenteeism rates3 from the school or from the classroom (when teachers are in
the school) are negatively correlated with welfare. Teachers are more likely to be absent in poor
areas. For those in the poorest quintile, about four out of ten teachers are absent from school. The
corresponding figure for the richest quintile is two out of ten teachers. The two poorest regions
(Northern and Eastern) are also the regions with higher teacher’s absenteeism. Perhaps this
absenteeism may be driven the fact that most locations in these regions are hard to reach and hard
to stay.4 As illustrated in Table 3, field trip, salary retrieve, strike, and illness are the main reasons
for teacher’s absence. Teacher’s absenteeism is much lower in private schools compared to public
schools. In Uganda’s public schools, close to 60 percent of teachers were not in the classroom
teaching. The corresponding figure for private schools is 39.8 percent. Teacher’s absenteeism
induce inefficiency on public spending as they are paid, but not working for the equivalent amount
of time. In addition, teacher’s absenteeism can hurt pupils’ educational achievement. When that
teacher is repeatedly absent, pupils’ performance can be significantly impacted in a negative way.
The more days a teacher is out of the classroom, the more likely their pupils will achieve lower
scores in standardized tests (Mary Finlayson, 2009).

  SDI uses a standardized, internationally benchmarked methodology to measure absenteeism, namely unannounced
visits. SDI consists of two visits to each facility; the first is announced in advance so as to increase the likelihood of
being able to collect the data underlying most of the indicators. The second visit, which happens during the 7 days
following the first visit, is unannounced and its sole purpose is to ascertain the whereabouts of the providers. Providers
who are not in the facility because it is not their shift are not considered absent. Health workers who are not in the
facility because they are carrying out outreach activities are likewise not considered absent.

  In a sense that it is difficult to realize infrastructural development, such as roads, electricity, buildings, safe water,
etc. These areas are at times cut off from the rest of the district especially in rainy seasons. Because of these problems,
hard to reach and hard to stay areas often failed to attract better human resource.
                                                                                                                          6
        The SDI gathered information of the classroom environment for a primary 4 classroom,
and infrastructure availability and the school level. These include availability of library,
blackboard, electricity, etc. (see Table 3 for a detailed list).5 The learning environment in school
is much better in richer areas. For instance, schools in richer areas are more likely to have a library,
electricity, and work displayed on the walls. The classroom environment is of low standard in the
Northern region, with no library available, no displayed material, and only 3 percent of schools
have access to electricity. The classroom environment is much better in private schools compared
to public schools. Overall, serious challenges remain when it comes to classroom environment,
especially in line with the country’s ambition to become a middle-income country in the near
future. Indeed, availability of a library, electricity or displayed material is still very low. For
instance, only 8.8 percent of schools have a library. The corresponding figure for electricity is only
10.8 percent. Yet, connectivity to electricity will be important in operationalizing the “skilling
Uganda” agenda, towards ICT and more vocational training. Availability of electricity will be
crucial to achieve these goals that aim at leaning towards more operational and ready to be
employed students at all levels.
        At the national level, three out of five schools have a functioning Parent-Teacher
Association (PTA). Schools in poor areas are less likely to have a PTA. 46.6 percent of schools
in the poorest quintile have a functioning PTA. The corresponding figure for the richest quintile is
55.2 percent. In the poorest region, the Northern, only 46.3 percent of schools have a functioning
PTA. This finding is in line with previous studies that found that perception of the importance of
school is low among the poor (Tsimpo and Wodon, 2015). Seven out of ten schools have a
functioning School Management Committee (SMC). There is no apparent relation between welfare
and availability of SMC in a school. Both PTA and SMC are more present in public schools.
         The probability of a school receiving the visit of an inspector during the school year is
close to one for most schools. This is true across regions, regardless of wealth. The only exception
is the Western region where up to 11 percent of schools did not receive an inspector visit during
the year. The number of inspections carried at the school was found to be correlated to welfare.
Inspectors tend to often visit schools that are located in better-off areas. Here again, issues related
to the fact that poor areas are more likely to be hard to reach hard to stay areas, and transport issues
are clear factors limiting the work of inspectors (Office of the prime Minister, 2012).

 The factor on classroom environment is derived by running a factorial analysis on this list, all items are positively
correlated to the first factor. This factor is used as factor for classroom environment (Figure 1). This is weighted
average where the weight on each variable in the list is derived from the data.

Unlike education, there is little correlation between welfare and the quality of inputs in the
health sector
       The SDI survey gathered information on the quality of inputs in the health sector.
Caseload,6 absenteeism7 of health workers, availability of management structures, drugs
availability, availability of infrastructure and equipment are some of the indicators that can be
derived from the survey.
        There is a clear correlation between patient caseload and welfare, especially if one focuses
on the median (Table 4 and Figure 2). Here we focus on the median to avoid the possibility of
outliers driving the mean results. The poorer the area, the higher the patient caseload. Looking at
the median, a health provider in the poorest quintile consulted 6 outpatients per day, against only
3 outpatients for the richest quintile. As a consequence, sick people in poor areas are more likely
to face overcrowding and long queue while visiting their health centers. There is a lot of disparity
across provider types (public-private) and regions of health workers’ level of effort. Public health
providers’ caseload (6 outpatients per provider per day) was three times that of private providers
(2 outpatients). Rural health workers’ caseload was more than twice that of urban health workers’.
Health workers in the Northern region, were the busiest and received 6 outpatients on a daily basis.
The Eastern and Western regions also had high patient caseload with 5 health provider consulting
6 outpatients each on a daily basis.
        Unlike the education sector, there is no apparent correlation between health workers’
absenteeism and welfare. At the national level, it is estimated that close to half of health workers
were absent, including off duty workers. Excluding off duty, absenteeism rate remains high at 42
percent. The incidence of health workers’ absenteeism is quite similar across welfare quintile.
There are important disparities across regions. Health workers are more likely to be absent in the
Central region: close to six health workers out of ten where absent when including off-duty. Even
if those who were off-duty are excluded, the Central remains the region with the highest
absenteeism rate: 51 percent. Surprisingly, the absenteeism rate in the private health facilities is
almost as high as in the public sector. For private providers, four out of five health workers were
absent.
        On average about half of health facilities reported the presence of a functioning Health
Facility Management Committee (HFMC) with important variations across provider types and
regions. Notably, private facilities, especially private for profit tend not to have a HFMC. Only 29
percent of private health facilities have a HFMC, against 73.9 percent for public facilities. This is
the factor driven the lowest incidence of HFMC observed in Kampala and in the fourth quintile.
Most of the private for profit facilities are in Kampala and in the fourth quintile of welfare. Very
few health facilities have a procurement committee or an audit committee (only 5.9 and 6.2 percent
respectively). As a consequence, issues related to proper financial and resources management can

  Patient caseload is and indicator that measures health provider’s level of effort. It is defined as the average number
of outpatient visits a health provider attends to per working day. It is computed as the number of outpatient visits
recorded in outpatient records in the three months prior to the survey, divided by the number of days the facility was
open during the three-month period and the number of health workers who conduct patient consultations (i.e.
excluding any staff who do not see patients).

  See footnote 1 on how absenteeism is computed.
                                                                                                                    10
be an issue. Disciplinary Committees are available only in one out of five health facilities. The
share of health facilities with a quality assurance committee is also low (12.6 percent). Disciplinary
and quality assurance committees are more likely to be present in poor areas. Perhaps this is
because quality issues are more prevalent in poor areas. For example, as shown above, rural health
workers have twice the caseloads of urban health workers, and rural areas are more likely to be
poor.
        In Uganda, most of the public facilities (90 percent) are push facilities.8 While most of the
private ones are pull facilities. For public facilities, the drugs system is centralized under the
National Medical Store (NMS). Under this organization, the NMS purchase drugs in bulk and
handles the logistics of distribution across the country, as well as retrieving the expired drugs for
proper disposal. This dichotomy between public and private providers is driving the story behind
drugs. Facilities that are located in poor areas are mainly public facilities, and therefore fall under
the push system. Private facilities, especially the private for profit, are located in better-off areas,
as a consequence, facilities under the pull system are those located in better-off areas.
         The pull system seems to be effective. Availability of essential drugs is much higher in
public facilities that are under the push system from the NMS. The six tracer drugs9 were available
in 46 percent of public facilities. Availability of the tracer drugs falls to 15 percent for private
facilities. The business model is likely to be determinant on the behavior of private for profit firms.
They are there to make a profit, and will focus on drugs that patients will feel comfortable buying,
and not on the tracers as recommended by the Ministry of Health. The presence of private
pharmacies, and their comparative advantage in the drug business may be another factor explaining
the behavior of private for profit providers. Surprisingly, the Northern region is the region with
the highest availability of the tracer drugs. Efficiency of the NMS coupled with interventions of
NGO are probable reasons for this. Amount the six tracer drugs, measles vaccine registered the
highest out of stock. Thus acting on measles vaccine will increase the availability of tracers by a
big margin.
       The SDI collected information on availability of basic infrastructure and equipment
expected at a health facility. These include availability of electricity, piped water, toilets,
ambulance, microscope, weighing scale, blood pressure machine, thermometer, malaria test kit,
HIV test kit, etc. (see Table 4 for a detailed list10). In each case the equipment needed to be
observed by the enumerator and assessed as functioning. The availability of these inputs is highly

  Distribution from the main storage point to a lower level store or health facility may follow the push or pull system
or a combination of both. In the pull system medicines requests are sent from the lower level. Adequate human
resources are required to calculate medicines needs to last for a certain defined period of distribution. The push system
is used mainly in situation where there is no adequate storage space or personnel to manage a range of products. In
this case, a list of products is pushed from the higher level of warehouse to the health facilities during a defined time
frame. A combination approach is used in situations where the regional or district stores are subsidiary of the Central
Medical Store. In this case, the push system may be used to supply these subsidiary stores and the pull systems is used
to distribute stock to the health facilities (see WHO website for more information).

   The six major tracer drugs on Uganda’s essential medicines and health supplies (EMHS) list are: Artemisinin
combination therapy (ACT); Cotrimoxazole; Measles vaccine; Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS sachets);
Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera); and Fansidar.

   The index on infrastructure/equipment availability is derived by running a factorial analysis on this list, all items
are positively correlated to the first factor. This factor is used as index on infrastructure/equipment availability (figure
2). This is weighted average where the weight on each variable in the list is derived from the data.
                                                                                                                        11
and positively correlated with welfare. For example, health facilities in richer areas are more likely
to have electricity, and piped water. This is not surprising as electricity and piped water networks
are non-existent in poor areas, and alternatives are costly.11 Only one out of ten health facilities
has a functioning ambulance. Ambulances are more likely to be available in richer areas.
Surprisingly, availability of telephone (land line and cell phone) remains low in health facilities.
All health facilities in the richest quintile have an adult weighing scale, while the corresponding
figure for the poorest quintile is only 58 percent. Maternity waiting centers (antenatal rooms) are
available in only 23.9 percent of health centers. This probably explains the fact that a low
proportion of women delivered in formal health facilities under the attendance of a specialized
health worker, despite the high rate of attendance for antenatal care and the mama kit program
(Tsimpo and Wodon, 2015). The Northern and the Eastern regions, which happened to be the
poorest, are also those with very limited availability of infrastructure and equipment in health
facilities.

4.     Providers’ knowledge and attitudes

Teachers had significant knowledge gaps. Teachers’ knowledge of the subjects they teach
as well as pedagogical knowledge are very low, especially in poor areas
        The share of teachers with minimum content knowledge was observed based on the results
of a customized teacher test administered to Primary 4 mathematics/numeracy and English
teachers. The English test results were for teachers teaching English, and the mathematics test
results were for teachers teaching mathematics. The tests were based on items from the curricula
being taught in Uganda (World Bank, 2013). The objective of the teacher test is to examine
whether teachers have the basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills that lower primary students
need to have in order to progress further with their education. This is interpreted as the minimum
knowledge required for the teacher to be effective and is the basis for the “Share of Teachers with
minimum knowledge indicator”.
         The test results revealed that teachers’ knowledge of the subjects they teach was very low,
and the pedagogical skills to transform their knowledge into meaningful teaching were even lower.
On average, teachers scored 59 percent and 64 percent in the English and numeracy/mathematics
tests, respectively (Figure 3 and Table 5). There is little difference on teachers’ knowledge by
provider type. Performance of teachers in private schools is quite close to those of teachers in
public schools. There is a clear positive relationship between teachers’ knowledge and welfare.
Teachers’ knowledge increases with welfare of the location. For instance, teachers in the poorest
quintile scored 56 percent and 59 percent, in the English and numeracy/mathematics tests,
respectively. The corresponding figures for the richer quintile are 62 and 68 percent. As a
consequence of the positive correlation between teachers’ knowledge and welfare, the Northern
region which is also the poorest is the region where teachers’ scores are lowest for both the English
and mathematics tests.
        The SDI survey also assessed teaching ability through a test of pedagogical knowledge.
Survey estimation results suggest that pedagogy skills are disappointingly low, as reflected in the
average score of 25 percent on the pedagogy test, and only 7 percent of teachers scored above 50
percent. Pedagogical knowledge appears to be slightly lower in poor areas, in rural areas, and in
the Northern and Western regions, highlighting the positive correlation between educational
quality and welfare.

Only a small proportion of health workers were able to diagnose all five tracer conditions.
The accuracy of diagnoses is lower in poor areas
        Quality in the health sector was assessed using two indicators of process (adherence to
clinical guidelines in five tracer conditions and management of maternal and newborn
complications—as measured in the vignette interviews); and one indicator of outcomes (diagnostic
accuracy in the five tracer conditions at the end of the vignette interviews). Three of the tracer
conditions were childhood conditions (malaria with anemia, acute diarrhea with severe
dehydration, and pneumonia), and two were adult conditions (pulmonary tuberculosis and diabetes
mellitus). Two other conditions were included: post-partum hemorrhage, the most common cause
of maternal death during birth; and neonatal asphyxia, the most common cause of neonatal death
during birth (World Bank, 2013).
        Only a small proportion of health workers were able to diagnose all five tracer conditions.
Only one in four health workers were able to do this. Malaria with anemia is the disease for which
health workers exhibit a higher and very good knowledge of. Almost all of them (96.3 percent)
were able to properly diagnose this condition. Notably, all health workers (99.9 percent) in the
Central region were able to diagnose malaria and anemia. Providers in private facilities are slightly
more competent in the diagnostic of malaria and anemia compared to their counterparts in public
health facilities.
        The accuracy of diagnostics is lower in poor area, especially for acute diarrhea, pneumonia,
diabetes mellitus, and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The diagnostic assessment shows that health
workers perform very poorly on acute diarrhea. Less than half (47 percent) were able to properly
diagnose acute diarrhea. Performance on pneumonia and diabetes mellitus is also very low, with
only 60 percent able to accurately diagnose each of these diseases. For all the diseases, health
workers’ knowledge increases with welfare (figure 4, table 7). For those in the poorest quintile,
only 16 percent were able to accurately diagnose the 5 tracer conditions. The corresponding figure
for the richest quintile is 39.6 percent. The biggest knowledge gap across welfare quintiles is
revealed through diagnosis of pneumonia. 85.3 percent of health workers in the richest quintile
were able to properly diagnose pneumonia, against only 44.5 for those in the poorest quintile. The
knowledge gap across quintile is also big (double digit) for acute diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, and
PTB. Providers in private facilities are more competent in the diagnostic of pneumonia and
diabetes Mellitus. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher in Kampala and lower in the
Northern region. For example, in Kampala, 41 percent of providers were able to accurately
diagnose all the 5 tracer conditions. In the Northern region, only 11 percent of providers were able
to do so.
        Only half (54.3 percent) of providers were able to properly manage maternal and newborn
complications (post-partum hemorrhage and neonatal asphyxia). There is no clear correlation
between welfare and management of neonatal asphyxia. Proper management of post-partum
hemorrhage increases with welfare. For example, for the richest quintile, 84.6 percent of providers
were able to properly manage post-partum hemorrhage. The corresponding figure for the poorest
quintile is 67.6 percent. Regionally, the worst performance is registered in the Eastern and Western
regions where only 48.6 and 52 percent (respectively) of providers are able to properly manage
neonatal asphyxia. The knowledge gap between these two regions and other regions regarding
                                                                                                  19
neonatal asphyxia is very big. In other regions, at least 74 percent of providers were able to
properly deal with neonatal asphyxia.
        Health workers’ knowledge gaps can have significant repercussions on the overall health
sector outcomes, and ultimately economic development (Quote XXX). Moreover, because of
medical errors due to limited knowledge, the society might be paying for health service, but in
return is not getting value for money. As a result, the overall health status is not what it should be.
Expenditure while sick does not guarantee that one will recover the stock of physical heath.

5.     Outcomes

       Learning outcomes are highly correlated with poverty. Thanks to the UPE reform,
children in poor areas are more likely to attend school, but they are failing to learn
         As part of the collection of the SDI survey, learning outcomes were measured for grade 4
pupils. The objective of the pupil’s assessment was to assess basic reading, writing, and arithmetic
skills. The test was designed by experts in international pedagogy and based on a review of primary
curriculum materials from 13 African countries, including Uganda (see Cunningham and Dowling,
2012). The pupil’s assessment also measured non-verbal reasoning skills on the basis of Raven’s
matrices, a standard IQ measure that is designed to be valid across different cultures. This measure
complements the pupil test scores in English and numeracy and can be used as a rough measure to
control for innate student ability when comparing outcomes across different schools. Thus, the
pupil assessment consisted of three parts: English, numeracy and non‐ verbal reasoning (NVR).
        Overall, pupils answered 47 percent of questions on the test correctly. The average score
in English was 46 percent and the average score in numeracy was 43 percent. The average score
on the non‐ verbal reasoning part was 57 percent. There is a lot of variation in learning outcomes
across area of residence, regions as well as public-private schools. Performance of pupils in private
schools was significantly higher, especially for English and numeracy. In private schools, pupils
answered 65 percent of questions on the test correctly, against 43 percent for those in public
schools. Performance in urban were higher in urban areas. Pupils in Kampala are by far the best
performers. In Kampala, pupils answered 80 percent of the questions correctly. Conversely, the
two poorest regions (Northern and Eastern regions) are the ones with the worst performance.
        Finding that pupils in private schools performed significantly better than those in public
schools is consistent with the reasoning that the quality of inputs have implications on children
learning outcomes. It was shown earlier that private schools had better quality inputs than public
schools. For example, section 3 highlighted that private schools had better classroom environment,
much lower teacher’s absenteeism, and smaller pupil to teacher and the pupil per classroom ratios
- all of which can negatively affect pupils learning outcomes. Indeed, regression results below
confirm this.
        Learning outcomes are strongly and positively correlated to welfare. Pupils who are in the
richest quintile scored 66 percent overall while those in the poorest quintile scored only 34 percent
(table 8). The biggest pupil knowledge gap is observed in the English test. Pupils in the richest
quintile answered 69 percent of English questions correctly. For those in the poorest quintile, only
31 percent correctly answered English questions. The knowledge gap across the welfare
distribution is also important for numeracy. But there is no apparent correlation between welfare
and nonverbal reasoning.
        A wide range of factors can affect the ability of children to learn in school. Previous work
for Uganda suggest that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to fare well. But
school-level factors also play a role (Mulindwa and Marshall, 2013). Given that the SDI data
combined information on both inputs and outcomes at school level, we can check whether the
quality of input are in some ways related to outcomes. This is done using econometric approach.

                                                                                                  22
This econometric analysis looks at the performance of grade 4 primary school students on tests for
English, numeracy, nonverbal reasoning, and the student’s overall score. The explanatory factors
include school level variables (whether the school is public or private; whether it has a parent-
teacher association (PTA), whether it has a school management committee (SMC), the number of
inspections carried at the school, an index for the school facilities and the environment in the
classroom, and the pupil-teacher ratio), teacher-level variables (an index for teacher quality and
measures of teacher knowledge for English and numeracy), child-level variables (age, gender, and
whether the child had breakfast) and community-level variables (urban versus rural areas, regions,
and welfare quintiles for the community). Results from the regression analysis of the correlates of
student achievement are provided in Table 9.
        Performance in public schools is on average lower than in private schools. Schools with a
lower pupil-teacher ratio tend to do better than schools with a higher pupil-teacher ratio. In most
cases PTAs and SMC do not make much of a difference, but this could be because how, for
example, a SMC operates may be more important than its mere existence. More inspections are
associated with higher performance. Finally, better school/classroom facilities and to some extent
management are also associated with better student performance. Teacher absenteeism reduces
student performance, regardless of whether the teacher was absent from the school, or in school
but not in the classroom. Better teaching in the classroom as measured though an index of teacher
behavior leads to better student performance, as does a better score of the teacher on English and
numeracy tests. Older children tend to perform worse (this may be capturing children who
repeated previous grades). Girls also perform worse than boys. Children who had breakfast at
home perform better (this may denote a higher socio-economic status of the household, and also
point out to the importance of school feeding in disadvantaged areas). Children in urban areas
perform better than in rural areas for some subjects. Performance is higher for children in Kampala
and the Central region than in the Western, Northern, and Eastern regions. Children in poorer
communities do no perform as well as children in better off areas as measured by the community’s
welfare index.
         Generally speaking, these results are consistent with expectations, and have important
policy implications. For example, the results suggest that improvements in school facilities as well
as improvements in the quality of teaching and the knowledge base of teachers could bring
substantial gains in student performance, especially in poor areas. A reduction in pupil-teacher
ratio would also bring gains, although these are likely to be smaller, and may be costlier to achieve
in terms of budgetary resources. Although one should be careful not to infer causality, it could be
that strengthening the inspection regime would also bring gains, while by contrast PTAs and SMCs
seem to have less of a beneficial impact. As illustrated by Mulindwa and Marshall (2013),
members of PTAs and SMCs often lack the basics skills to properly play their role.
       Outcomes for the health sector are more complex to measure, thus the SDI did not collect
such information. It is therefore not possible to make a similar assessment for the health sector

6.     Implications for social accountability

The quality of services delivery, as well as social outcomes are very low in poor
communities, yet these communities are more satisfied with the services
       The community module of the 2012/13 UNHS ask questions on perceptions of the quality
of basics social services. Community members were asked to rank services according to their
appreciation of the quality. The possible answers were the quality of service is “good”, “average”
and “poor”. The top four rated services are private hospitals (by comparison government hospitals
are ranked 13th), NGOs, pharmacies, and banks and financial institutions. Apart from three types
of roads that are at the bottom of the ranking (community, feeder/district, and trunk roads),
government primary schools and government health centers are poorly rated (see Tsimpo and
Wodon, 2015b for more details).
        The perceived quality of service is negatively correlated with welfare. The poor are more
likely to be satisfied with the service that they are receiving, although objective measures from the
SDI survey suggest that it should be the opposite (Figures 6 and 7). In particular, for both education
and health, the poor are more likely to be satisfied with the public provider compared to the non-
poor. A phenomenon close to Inada conditions must be at play here. This means that the poor are
so deprived that their expectations are low, and they quickly tend to be happy with the little service
that they can get. On the contrary, the non-poor tend to have higher expectations, and therefore
will be more demanding in terms of quality, and less satisfied even if objectively they are getting
the best service in the country.
Poverty can be a barrier for citizens to properly engage in social accountability
       Lower expectations from the poor can be a problem for social accountability. Social
accountability is an approach towards building accountability that relies on civic engagement, in
which citizens participate directly or indirectly in demanding accountability from service providers
and public officials. Social accountability generally combines information on rights and service
delivery with collective action for change. In Uganda, Social accountability has emerged as an
important weapon in the fight for better governance and service delivery (Rosetti, 2002). Examples
include U-report, Barazas, and Uganda Participatory Poverty Assessment Process.
       Besides low expectations, there are several other hypotheses for this observation. First, it
could just be lack of information by the poor of what their options or choices are. For example,
the supply of private facilities may not be available for the poor. Second, poor people just cannot
hold providers accountable either because they cannot observe provider quality, or they do not
have the power. Third, there also exists the possibility that the poor could be threatened if they
engage in organizing themselves. Fourth and finally, the opportunity costs of organizing for a
sustained period of time could be really high for the poor.
        The contrast between the objective measure of quality from the SDI and the perceived
quality from the UNHS raises the question of the effectiveness/efficiency of community based
monitoring or demand for accountability. If the population has low expectations, or is not exposed
enough to know what quality to expect, how can it efficiently act or demand for quality service?
Thus, the implication is that for social accountability to be effective and efficient, mitigations
                                                                                                   26
actions must be taken to influence expectations of the citizens, especially the most disadvantaged
and the poor. There are other examples in the literature that questioned effectiveness of social
accountability. Empirical evidence of tangible impacts of social accountability initiatives is mixed
(Jonathan A. Fox, 2015). In Benin for example, Keefer and Stuti (2014) found that government
inputs into public education are no different in villages with greater access to community
radio/information. Moreover, it is claimed that social accountability can fail if the political
economy is not catered for (Anuradha Joshia et al., 2012). In a context where poverty and
expectations are a problem, more should be done for social accountability to be effective.

7.           Conclusion

        Building on the originality of the SDI survey, this paper has provided a descriptive analysis
of service delivery in Uganda, focusing on inputs (providers’ behavior and knowledge,
infrastructure) and learners’ outcomes. Moreover, combining the SDI and the UNHS surveys, the
paper shows a strong correlation between welfare and quality of service. Those living in poor areas
face the poorest quality of service. This also has implications for outcomes. Pupils in poor areas
perform poorly on a standardized test covering English, numeracy and nonverbal reasoning.
Increased access to education was not accompanied by improvement in learning outcomes.
        Econometric analysis suggests that improvements in school facilities as well as
improvements in the quality of teaching and the knowledge base of teachers could bring substantial
gains in students’ performance, especially in poor areas. By contrast PTAs and SMCs seem to have
less of a beneficial impact.
        The perceived quality of service is negatively correlated with welfare. Poorer communities
tend to have services of lower quality but are more satisfied with the services that they are
receiving. Low quality of inputs in poor communities negatively affects outcomes such as student
learning. The poor are more likely to be satisfied with the service that there are getting, although
objective measures from the SDI survey suggest that it should be the opposite. This implies that
the poor are so deprived that their expectations are low, and they tend to be happy with the little
service that they can get. Conversely, the non-poor tend to have higher expectations, and therefore
will be more demanding in terms of quality, and less satisfied even if objectively they are getting
the best service in the country.
       The contrast between the objective measure of quality and the perceived quality has
implications for social accountability mechanisms. If populations in poor areas have low
expectations, their ability to monitor quality is weakened. Apart from the demonstration of the
need to improve inputs for education and health facilities in Uganda, one of the implications of the

                                                                                                                                                                                                       28
analysis is that for social accountability mechanisms to be effective, additional measures must
probably be taken in order to enable populations in poor communities to ask for and obtain higher
quality services.
