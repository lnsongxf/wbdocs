About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Agency : Centre de Formalités des Entreprises (CFE)

        The Centre de Formalités des Entreprises (CFE) handles all formalities related
        to the trade register in the court (RCS, Tribunal de Commerce), statistics
        (INSEE), tax authorities (Centre des Impôts), social security (URSSAF), labor
        (Direction Departemental du Travail et de L’emploi), health insurance (Caisse
        regionale D’assurance Maladie), unemployment insurance, pension,
        Employment Pole (Pole Emploi), and similar bodies.

        The company's Articles of Association and bylaws, lease, attestation of
        receipt of funds, documents concerning the manager, ad hoc forms,
        evidence of publication, and so forth must be led in a single le. After
        receiving the request, the CFE must process the documents and transfer
        them to the respective o ces and authorities. If the request is incomplete,
        the CFE has 15 days to return the documents for completion. The CFE
        automatically enters the information in the Registre Nationale des
        Entreprise (Répertoire SIRENE) and obtains identi cation numbers from the
        RNE: SIRENE number (Systéme Informatique pour le Répertoire des
        Entreprises), SIRET number (Systéme Informatique pour le Répertoire des
        Etablissements), and NAF number (Nomenclature des Activitees Francaises).

       The SIRET is used, among other things, by the tax authorities.


       Since the Dutreil Law, the CFE or the Commercial Registry can deliver a
       receipt for company creation (récepissé de creation d’entreprise) as soon as
       they have received the documents, so that the company can start
       operations without having to wait for its RCS number.


       The registration process can be done online via the Guichet Unique portal or
       Infogre e web portal after creating a personal account to connect, unless
       there is a regulated activity (for example, hairdresser, butcher, Realtor or
       lawyer) requiring prior authorization not yet possible on the website for all
       regulated professions.


       Though the CFE does not charge the entrepreneurs for this procedure, 41.50
       euros must be paid at the CFE to register in the Commercial Court.

       must purchase the minutes of the records and the ledger and have these
       books initialed by the clerk of the Commercial Court.


       The books have numbered pages or numbered sheets, both of which must
       be certi ed by the Commercial Court. If a book with numbered pages is used,
       the certi cation is made only once (when the company is incorporated). If
       numbered sheets are used, the certi cation must be made for the minutes
       of shareholders’ meeting. If an accounting book is used, the certi cation
       must be made once each scal year. Therefore, for practical reasons books
       are often used.

       In theory, it is possible to have an electronic minute book provided that the
       procedure to draft the document is secured (to avoid document
       modi cation once it is drafted). Such a solution is rarely used because a

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      certi cate indicates if the land can be used for a project and the existing or
      planned state of public utilities (channels and networks) to serve or serve
      this land.

      A planning certi cate is valid for 18 months and can be renewed 2 months
      prior to its expiration. The request for a planning certi cate must be
      submitted at the City Hall where the lot is located using a form Cerfa N°
      13410*01. The average time to process the operational planning certi cate is
      2 months. If no answer is given within these 2 months, the silent-is-consent
      rule applies.

      Agency : Private Firm

      By law a bureau de controle (independent from the construction company)
      must conduct all technical inspections during construction. The Spinetta Act
      78-12 of January 4, 1978 established and provided a legal framework for the
      Controle Technique in construction in France.

  3   Obtain building permit                                                              90 days                    EUR 42,855
      Agency : City Hall (Mairie)

      To obtain a building permit, BuildCo must submit the following:
      • Location plan (orientation, access roads) and overall plan of the
      construction or renovation (dimensions, elevations, connections, access),
      drawn up on grounds of the Land Registry–based map, representing the plot
      • Front elevations
      • Views, cross sections, layout
      • Document with a detailed description of the project impact on the existing
      landscape to prove that it is environmentally friendly
      • Survey photographs (both near- and long-range), allowing for the easy
      identi cation of the site in relation to the surrounding areas


      To prepare this documentation, BuildCo must obtain the building permit
      forms from City Hall or on the Internet through the Booth for Forms (Guichet
      des formulaires) of the Equipment, Transport, and Housing Ministry
      (Ministère de l’ Equipment, des Transports et du Logement)
      (www.equipement.gouv.fr/). Four copies of the application are led at City
      Hall and a receipt is given in person or it may be sent by registered mail with
      acknowledgement of receipt. If one document is missing, claims must be
      made within 14 days after registration. Where the application is
      accompanied by all the required documents, the contractor will receive
      acknowledgment of receipt, indicating the date and registration number and
      the time needed for title investigation.

      The building permit will be issued within 3 months after registration of the                                                  Page 14

       To obtain a building permit, BuildCo must submit the following:
       • Location plan (orientation, access roads) and overall plan of the
       construction or renovation (dimensions, elevations, connections, access),

       landscape to prove that it is environmentally friendly
       • Survey photographs (both near- and long-range), allowing for the easy
       identi cation of the site in relation to the surrounding areas


       To prepare this documentation, BuildCo must obtain the building permit
       forms from City Hall or on the Internet through the Booth for Forms (Guichet
       des formulaires) of the Equipment, Transport, and Housing Ministry
       (Ministère de l’ Equipment, des Transports et du Logement)
       (www.equipement.gouv.fr/). Four copies of the application are led at City
       Hall and a receipt is given in person or it may be sent by registered mail with
       acknowledgement of receipt. If one document is missing, claims must be
       made within 14 days after registration. Where the application is
       accompanied by all the required documents, the contractor will receive
       acknowledgment of receipt, indicating the date and registration number and
       the time needed for title investigation.

       The building permit will be issued within 3 months after registration of the
       application (except where the plot is a classi ed site). The contractor shall
       deem the permit tacitly granted if no reply is received within the 3 month
       period. The building permit is valid for 2 years. The contractor must begin
       work (or apply for an extension) within that time; otherwise, the permit
       expires. Moreover, if the contractor halts work for over a year, the validity of
       the permit expires, even if the 2-year statutory period has not yet elapsed.
       The permit must be displayed at the construction site and must include all
       the requisite information: mandatory dimensions, building permit number
       and date of issue, name of permit holder, nature of the work, and the
       address of City Hall where construction documents are open to public
       scrutiny.


       A copy of the building permit must be available in City Hall for 2 months to
       enable any aggrieved third parties (i.e., adjacent property owners) to
       challenge it.


       The application form to connect to sewage is also included when requesting
       a building permit. The application is to the addressed to the Sanitation
       department of Ville de Paris.

   4   Apply for water connection                                                         0.5 days   no charge
       Agency : Eaux de Paris

       The water utility connection is typically a lengthy process. Thus, it is
       advisable to request it prior to beginning construction work.

      Agency : City Hall (Mairie)

      The declaration of the opening of construction site is a key step. This
      declaration can be done either by completing a form (Cerfa 46.0394)
      obtainable either at City Hall or on the Internet through the (Guichet des
      formulaires), located at the Equipment, Transport and Housing Ministry
      (Ministère de l’ Equipment, des Transports et du Logement) Web site
      (www.equipement.gouv.fr/) or online.


      If the applicant chooses to mail the form, then the completed forms must be
      sent to City Hall by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt.

  7   Obtain water connection                                                               30 days                    EUR 3,670

  8   Declare completion of construction                                                    1 day                      no charge
      Agency : City Hall (Mairie)

      Within 30 days of work completion, the contractor must send City Hall a
      notice -- by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt, through a
      letter signed by the contractor’s company, or by the rms that worked on
      the project -- in which the architect declares the completion of the
      construction. That document must be included in the building permit
      application le. Three copies of the forms must be completed.

  9   Receive visit by building inspectors and obtain compliance certi cate                 1 day                      no charge
      Agency : City Hall or Equipement Departmental Directorate

      The compliance certi cate attests that the completed project meets the
      building permit speci cations. Once the declaration of completion is led, an
      o cial from City Hall or the Equipment Departmental Directorate (Direction
      Départementale de l’Équipement, DDE) then visits the site to verify whether
      the structure conforms to building permit speci cations. The compliance
      certi cate is issued within 3 months of the application if the speci cations
      are met.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : ENEDIS

      The connection application form and the list of documents required for this
      application are available on the website of ENEDIS. The application (and
      supporting documents) can also be submitted directly online since the end
      of 2016.

      Along with the application, the client needs to submit the following
      documents:
      • Information about the company, the site, and the project contact people
      • The client’s needed capacity; capacities have to be provided in kVA for Low-
      Voltage (LV) connections and in kW for Medium-Voltage (MV) connections.
      • A list of the client’s electrical equipment so ENEDIS can determine the
      potential disruptions on their network.
      • The site plan of the land from the municipality (plan de situation du
      terrain), specifying the boundaries of the property,
      • Copy of the planning permission ("autorisation d’urbanisme du projet")
      • The "plan de masse", which presents the proposed development of the site
      in terms of access to public roads and connections to networks and speci es
      the location of the individual circuit box and, if applicable, the monitored
      power cabinet
      • The client’s date of nal connection (energization)


      Upon receipt of the complete le, ENEDIS then carries out a technical study
      and sends the customer a connection proposal. This document contains:
      - A description of the technical solution selected, detailing the work that the
      applicant must carry out before the intervention of ENEDIS
      - A provisional timetable for the execution of the works,
      - The contacts of an ENEDIS adviser, which will handle the case
      - The connection agreement, which details the technical, legal and nancial
      elements for the connection of the electrical installation and the operating
      rules of this facility.
      - The period of validity of the proposal is 3 months.

      Agency : ENEDIS

      After receiving the application, ENEDIS inspects the site to determine the
      material needed for the external works and nal connection. It then sends
      the client either an estimate of the connection fees or the requirements for
      the connection (both technical and nancial).

  3   Receive external works from ENEDIS                                                  47 calendar days         EUR 1,840.44
      Agency : ENEDIS

      For the works to start, the client needs to pay at least 50% of the estimate of
      fees. ENEDIS then generates an identi cation number that will be used in all
      its future communications with the client, and especially when the client will
      request the nal connection (energization) from their electricity supplier.
      ENEDIS will also indicate an expected date for the end of the external works
      and a date after which the service can be energized.

      As soon as clients receives this information, they can contact their electricity                                            Page 22

       As soon as clients receives this information, they can contact their electricity
       supplier to prepare the supply contract required for the nal connection.
       The connection process might also require works to be done in the public or
       private domain. In this case ENEDIS will obtain all necessary administrative
       permits.

       Once the works are completed, the client’s private electrical installation is
       connected to the public distribution network. The client should not wait for
       the external works to end in order to obtain a conformity certi cate of
       internal installation.

   4   Obtain compliance certi cate for internal wiring                                    20 calendar days   EUR 43.59
       Agency : CONSUEL

       The customer can choose any private electrician for the internal wiring. At
       the end of the works, they will need to request a conformity certi cate from
       a control body, such as CONSUEL, that may check the entire internal
       installation to make sure it is conforming to the regulation NF C 15-100. The
       type of Consuel certi cate needed in this case is an "Attestation de
       conformité "VERTE" ("Locaux à réglementations particulières").

       In order to obtain a copy of the form to ll out, the client will need to write to
       CONSUEL (http://www.consuel.com/visa.htm#1). The client will need to
       attach the establishing shot (« plan de situation ») to the application.


       CONSUEL may conduct an inspection based on a risk-assessment system. In
       any case, a certi cate will be issued which Electricité Réseau Distribution
       France will check when carrying out the nal connection.

   5   Sign supply contract and obtain meter installation and nal connection               4 calendar days    EUR 155.3
       Agency : ENEDIS

       The energy supplier will propose a supply contract to the client. Once the
       customer has signed the contract, the supplier will request the nal
       connection from ENEDIS on the client’s behalf, which is done if all payments
       of connection costs are made to ENEDIS and if the certi cate from CONSUEL
       is presented.

      As a result of the implementation of the Power Performance Diagnostic
      (“Diagnostic de performance énergétique”, loi du 12 juillet 2010), it is only for
      information, and can be obtained online in Paris. According to the “Loi
      Grenelle”, passed on July 12, 2010, under article 1 which modi es the code de
      la construction et de l'habitation, the DPE becomes mandatory for any
      property sold after January 1st, 2011. The seller can be held liable later if he
      does not submit these diagnostics.

  2   Obtain the waiver of preemption rights from the Municipality                        20 days                     no cost

      The notary writes to the city mayor to obtain the waiver of the city’s
                                                                                          5 and 6)
      preemption rights on the property. The notary informs about the
      transaction and the conditions agreed among the parties. It is common that
      many properties are subject to these requirements, since the Municipality
      may have the right to buy the property at the same price that it was agreed
      on the sale agreement. If the city does not answer in 2 months, then the
      preemption rights have been waived. It may be the case that the city informs
      the notary before the 2 months. There are some exemptions: if the building
      has been completed in the last 10 years or if the lot sold (used for residential
      purpose) is in a building where the co-ownership rules have been published
      at the land registry more than 10 years ago. Properties when the whole lot
      and building are sold will need the waiver for preemption rights. In practice it
      takes around 3 weeks on average to obtain this waiver.

       third parties after publication of the deed by the land registry o ce.


       On completion, the vendor’s creditors if any, must execute a deed of
       discharge or release of the existing mortgages bene ting to them.

       It is possible to make all transfer publication requests in France electronically
       (publication of the "acte authetique de vente" in order to make it opposable
       to third parties). The usage rate of the electronic system has been increasing
       consistently since 2009. The electronic system is faster and reduces the
       chances for errors, because the Property Registry employees do not have to
       input information manually into the system. Data is inserted electronically
       into the Fiji system automatically from Teleactes. Land registries are
       proactively inviting notaries to participate in the electronic system, with a
       positive response from notaries.

       At this point, rst the notary prepares the deed of sale with his own
       software, prints and has it signed by the parties. Then he inputs the
       information again in a separate screen of Teleactes to submit it to the
       Service de Publicite Fonciere for publication.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.



What the indicators measure                              Case study assumptions

Time required to enforce a contract through the          The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a sales contract
courts (calendar days)                                   between 2 domestic businesses. The case study assumes that the court
                                                         hears an expert on the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes

                                                         the case from simple debt enforcement.
  Time for trial and to obtain the judgment
                                                         To make the data comparable across economies, Doing Business uses
  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                         several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the          - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                      and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                          economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                         - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                         - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)               - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                         commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                         - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                  - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                 - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
                                                                                                                              Page 51

The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                         several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the          - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                      and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                          economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                         - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                         - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)               - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                         commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                         - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                  - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                 - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                   - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                         movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding          liquidation           In France, the legislator stresses preventive procedures that can benefit companies that are
                    (after an             not yet in insolvent. But, under the case study assumptions, Mirage is already insolvent
                    attempt at            because it cannot pay the money owed to BizBank. Therefore, there are two possibilities –

                                          procedure, (ii) request liquidation. Because Mirage’s managements want to continue the
                                          company operating, it will request the opening of reorganization proceedings. The standard
                                          to choose between judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation is the final capacity to
                                          overcome the difficulties. This explains why the reorganization procedure can be chosen in
                                          the case of Mirage. The opening of reorganization proceedings will stop payments of pre-
                                          commencement creditors and impose a moratorium during the observation period (12
                                          months and exceptionally 18). This would enable Mirage to obtain from Mirage, either a
                                          return of the outstanding debt, or more time to repay that would not last more than 10
                                          years. But it is likely that the procedure will be converted to liquidation if Mirage cannot
                                          respect the engagements fixed in its reorganization plan or if it is manifestly impossible to
                                          agree on a plan.

Outcome             going concern         If Mirage is liquidated, its activity could be provisionally continued to enable potential buyers
                                          to present offers to maintain all or part of the assets and activities. The activity will then be
                                          continued by the buyer.

Time (in years)     1.9                   According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted into
                                          liquidation takes approximately 23 months. The observation period would take six months, if
                                          it is not renewed. If the procedure is converted to liquidation, the court fixes the time after
                                          which the closure of the procedure must be decided and may extend this period by a
                                          reasoned decision. There is no maximum duration of a bankruptcy procedure but its closure
                                          may be requested at any time by the liquidator, the debtor, the prosecutor, the court ex
                                          officio or even after two years from the judgment opening liquidation proceedings, by a
                                          creditor.
