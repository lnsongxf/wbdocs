 A key strategy that Government of Uganda has pursued over the past decade has been to increase the amount of
 resources allocated to capital investments in order to address a binding constraint on growth, the huge infrastructure
 deficit. That notwithstanding, Uganda’s existing fiscal space has remained insufficient to meet its infrastructure needs,
 with an infrastructure financing gap estimated at US $ 0.4 million per annum. I am pleased to introduce the Ninth
 Uganda Economic Update, which discusses how Uganda can potentially nurture the public-private partnerships to
 address Uganda’s infrastructure deficit. As is increasingly being experienced by many other countries across the
 world, these arrangements can help mobilize resources to help fill the infrastructure gaps, with a possibility of such
 arrangements bringing in private financing and facilitating the achievement of higher levels of efficiency in infrastructure
 investments. Yet, these arrangements may also carry risks, with a potential to drive significant deviations of the
 outcomes from their expectations. In line with the structure of earlier editions of the Uganda Economic Update, the
 report first discusses the general status of the economy, before discussing the PPP specific topic in greater depth.

 At present, Uganda’s rate of economic growth is at its lowest level for the past two decades, largely due to the impact
 of factors related to the upheavals in Uganda’s banking system, the ongoing impact of the drought on agriculture, the
 civil strife in South Sudan, and the increasingly volatile external environment. While the authorities continue to pursue an
 ambitious public investment program intended to address Uganda’s long-standing physical infrastructure deficits and
 to prepare for the long-awaited extraction of oil, this program has not been implemented as fast as desired. In addition,
 so far, it has not been able to catalyze higher levels of private investment growth. Therefore, in the five-year period up
 to FY 2015/16, overall investments have been growing at the average annual rate of only 4.3 percent. At this rate, these
 investments have been able to generate only very modest overall economic growth. In the short-term future, economic
 growth also faces significant risks, including those related to the suboptimal sequencing, financing and management
 of the large infrastructure investment program and to the ongoing impact of the shocks that have constrained Uganda’s
 growth in the recent past.

 To mitigate the financing risk, the Government ought to explore non-traditional approaches to large infrastructure
 financing. Public-private partnerships have the potential to provide the resources and also to facilitate the achievement
 of higher levels of efficiency and thereby to improve the quality of infrastructure assets and services and to ensure
 greater coverage. However, they also have limitations. Therefore, for Uganda to maximize the value of such public-
 private partnerships, it will have to draw on the lessons learnt while implementing these arrangements and from global
 best experience. These lessons underlie the importance of building sufficiently strong institutions to appropriately
 design and implement these partnerships.

 I sincerely hope that this edition of the Uganda Economic Update will stimulate debate and motivate a comprehensive
 set of policy actions to champion more efficient management of investments implemented through public-private-
 partnerships, thereby promoting increased economic growth and supporting the achievement of Uganda’s development
 objectives.

 As a result of a number of internal and external                             presents an assessment of the current state of the
 shocks, Uganda’s economy is currently growing at the                         economy, while the second part addresses a specific
 lowest rate recorded over the past two decades. During                       theme related to Uganda’s development challenges
 the first nine months of FY 2016/17, the economy grew                        and the manner in which these may be addressed . This

 decline over the past five years is related partly to the                    in these arrangements, and by maximizing the economic

PART
State of the Ugandan
economy

By the end of March 2017, Uganda’s economy was growing at
the annualized rate of 2.5 percent, compared to 5.3 percent for the
corresponding year ending March 2016; this deceleration is the result of
the ongoing impact of the prolonged drought, to a slow recovery in the
provision of credit to the private sector by the banking system, and to
disruptions to trade with South Sudan.

Despite the impact of the drought on food prices, the inflation rate
has remained moderate. This enabled the authorities to continue
to ease their monetary policy stance, the effect of which gradually
became manifest, with the commercial banks slowly reducing
lending rates and accelerating the rate of expansion of credit to the
private sector and money supply during the six months to March
2017.

Uganda’s external current account deficit eased to a value equivalent
to 5.3 percent of GDP by the end of December 2016, with the import
bill being contained by low oil prices and exports increasing due to the
advent of refined gold exports and to the penetration of new markets in
South Asia. However, the overall external position remained weak due to
the failure to attract higher capital inflows.

On account of the huge under-execution of the budget during FY 2016/17,
the fiscal deficit is expected to reach only 3.5 percent of GDP, far lower than
the budget of 6 percent of GDP. With nearly 77 percent of this deficit funded
externally, the crowding out effect on the private sector is relatively insignificant.

The economy will grow at a rate below 4 percent this year, with this rate increasing to
around 5-6 percent in FY2017/18 and FY 2018/19, predicated on the effect of the drought
receding, the containment of the level of troubled assets within the banking sector, and
improvements to the execution of public projects.

With the performance of the private sector remaining subdued due to the ongoing impact of internal
and external shocks public investments will remain the key driver of growth, with their effect boosting
the construction sector in particular. The services sector is still the most significant contributor to total
value added in the economy.

With continued volatility posing challenges to long term finance and the financing of investments
in Uganda, the Government needs to ensure that its investment program is soundly financed and
generates real productivity improvements. To achieve this, the Government must address the
deficiencies within the domestic financial system, explore the use of blended financing options and
intensify efforts to tap into private sector capabilities through efficiently managing private public
partnerships.

the targeted level during this period was much smaller,
at 1.7 percent in the case of direct domestic taxes and
1.1 percent in the case of indirect taxes. Overall, the
total value of the gap between the revenues collected
and the targets stood at Shs 282 billion. With the shortfall
expected to persist to the end of the year, it is projected
that the total value of tax revenues collected will amount
to 13.3 percent of GDP in FY 2016/17. This is a higher
ratio than that recorded in FY 2015/16 (12.8 percent), but
it is lower than the budget target of 13.5 percent. The
external grants are also expected to reach 1.1 percent of
GDP by the end of the year, compared to the target of 1.8
percent in the budget. This implies that the total overall
value of resources available to the Government, can be
expected to reach an amount equivalent to 15.1 percent
of GDP, compared to the original budget target of 16.2
percent.

      Public Private Partnerships:
      A potential me ans
      to mobilize Uganda’s
      infrastructure finance

     Addressing Uganda’s infrastructure deficit would require a multi-
     pronged effort to raise capital to close the funding gap as well as
     to address inefficiencies to maximize value for money in these
     investments.
                                                    2
     The estimated level of investment required for Uganda to close
     the infrastructure gaps amounts to almost US$ 1.4 billion per
     year in the medium-term. This is about six percent of Uganda’s
     GDP per year. It is also estimated that a total of about US$300
     million is lost annually due to inefficiencies in infrastructure
     spending.

     If structured appropriately, public-private partnerships (PPPs)
     can help mobilize resources to help fill these infrastructure finance
     gaps, with a possibility of such arrangements bringing in private
     financing, development and management; as well as facilitating the
     achievement of higher levels of efficiency.

     Use of PPPs must be must be combined with a recognition of their
     limitations and the fiscal risks that may result in outcomes differing greatly
     from the forecasts or expectations. Therefore, it is important to have clear
     frameworks to assess, manage and backstop these risks.

     PPPs can be successful only if the Government is committed to building the right set
     of frameworks to provide the appropriate environment for private investments and adopting
     robust project identification, screening, procurement and contract management processes.

     PPPs can only be successful to the degree to which they can attract long term financing,
     especially given the availability of long-term financing is extremely limited in Uganda. The
     pension sector, representing the largest pool of long-term domestic capital in Uganda must be
     reformed so as to play the key role of providing long-term finance for PPPs in Uganda.

     Domestic currency financing is limited and financing for PPPs will require Uganda to work
     towards appropriate de-risking of projects in order to attract equity and debt financiers.

     incentivizes bidders to develop innovative solutions to
     meet contractual specifications.

       A PPP is defined as a long-term contract between a private party and a government entity, for providing a
       public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility, and
       responsibility is linked to performance. There can be several PPP contract types, with various combinations of
       the following broad parameters:

          (i) 	 Type of asset involved: PPPs can involve new assets (green-field projects) as has been the case for
               projects like Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Project. They can also be used to transfer responsibility for
               upgrading and managing existing assets to a private entity (brown field), with this mainly encountered
               during the privatization processes, as was the case of Nile Hotel and Conference Centre).

          (ii) 	 Responsibilities accorded to the private partner: A central characteristic of a PPP is that it bundles
               together multiple project phases. Nonetheless, the functions for which the private sector is responsible
               vary and can depend on the type of assets and service. Typical functions can include a combination of
               designing, constructing or rehabilitating, financing, maintaining and operating.

          (iii) Payment mechanism: The private party can be paid by collecting user fees from service users,
               by the government, or by a combination of the two, with the common defining characteristic being
               that payment is contingent upon performance. The payment mechanism usually depends upon a
               combination of factors including functional and risk allocation features of the contract.

          (iv) Financing mechanism: PPP financing may come from the public, private or development finance
               institutions, or a combination of various sources.

 Box 2 : Institutional Investors and Infrastructure Finance

 In Latin American countries such as Peru and Chile, the relatively developed capital markets and the presence of
 a number of institutional investors, such as pension funds, made it possible to issue project bonds or to structure
 other securitized instruments to meet these institutions’ needs (i.e. for investment grade instruments). Guarantees
 provided by monoline insurance companies assisted this model prior to the 2008 Global Financial crisis, but
 issuance has dried up since their subsequent demise. In Asia, the central provident funds, such as the EPF in
 Malaysia and the CPF in Singapore, have been active providers of long-term finance for infrastructure and other
 development projects. South Africa’s Public Investment Corporation is an example of an independent, specialist
 fund manager, with this entity making investments on behalf of other institutions, including pension funds, and
 including through the establishment of regional infrastructure funds. In regions with very limited capital markets
 and investors, governments and MDBs have had to act as the issuers or backers of instruments to provide the
 necessary investment quality, both in terms of credit levels and in terms of building the confidence of other
 investors.

     Box 4: Kampala-Jinja Expressway

     The Kampala-Jinja Expressway PPP is expected to be a 30-year greenfield design, build, finance, operate and
     maintain arrangement for a 77 km mainline from Kampala to Jinja and an 18km bypass to the south of Kampala
     city, costing about US$ 1 billion. As an alternative to the existing highway, it is expected to result in a high level
     of efficiency to both the national road network and to the East African transport corridor that provides the primary
     gateway for the flow of goods between Kenya and Uganda and neighboring Rwanda, DRC and South Sudan. A
     whole life arrangement to operate and maintain the expressway is being considered. In May 2014, the IFC was
     mandated by the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) as the transaction advisor for the development of the
     Kampala-Jinja Expressway under a PPP arrangement.

     The feasibility study considered the allocation of key project risks as follows:

       (i)	 The financing risk is expected to be shared between the Government and the private partner. The
            project will be financed through debt and equity. Three development partners, the European Union (EU),
            Agencie Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), will provide
            up to US$ 500 million to the Government to close a viability gap to buy down project capital costs. The
            residual funding needs for the project’s construction and operation will be provided by the private partner.
            The partner selected to design, build, finance, operate, maintain and transfer the expressway to the
            Government is expected to be procured through an international competitive bidding process.




36
  (ii)	 The delivery of the project’s right of way is a risk fully borne by the Government of Uganda. Access to land
       for such large projects is associated with a high degree of risk in the case of infrastructure projects in Uganda.
       Similarly, the scale and complexity of the land acquisition and resettlement program for the Kampala-Jinja
       Expressway makes land acquisition a major risk to this project. The Government, through UNRA, is committed to
       developing the Resettlement Action Plan in accordance with IFC Performance Standards.

  (iii)	 Construction could involve delays that would result into cost overruns and time delays. This risk is
       expected to be fully borne the private partner.

  (iv)	 The private partner will bear all risks associated with operating and maintaining the expressway in
       accordance with pre-agreed standards.

  (v)	 The Government will bear the demand risk. The project structure under consideration by the PPP Committee
       is an availability-based payment mechanism with all the collected tolls being used by the Government to meet
       availability payment obligations. Any shortfalls or surpluses related to the agreed availability payment are a risk
       borne by the Government. Revenues for the repayment of debt are based on a proposed toll road rate for which
       the value proposition to those willing to pay the road toll is time savings, vehicle operating cost savings and a
       safety premium.

  (vi)	 Forex risk is expected to be shared between the private party and the government . This is a key risk and
       irrespective of who bears it, it needs to be clearly assessed.

5. Creating the conditions necessary for Uganda
to maximize benefits from PPPs
The fore-going discussion underscored the challenge Uganda faces in closing the massive financing deficit. This
deficit arises from the need to provide infrastructure and social services crucial for the country’s social and economic
transformation. With the infrastructure deficit large and expected to increase in the medium term, the traditional
financing instruments are clearly insufficient to bridge the profound gap between existing public resources and
financing requirements. By leveraging synergies between the public and private sectors, PPPs can mobilize additional
sources of finance to fund the development of vitally needed infrastructure; to deliver on budget and on time to a
greater extent than in the case of publicly financed projects; and to deliver higher quality services than in the case of
publicly managed projects. Uganda has already started using PPPs and National Development Plan identifies PPPs as
a key instrument to attract new investment and to deliver infrastructure more efficiently. Uganda has also already put in
place an excellent legal and regulatory framework. The promulgation of the PPP Act in 2015 placed Uganda in the same
league as South Africa and Kenya in terms of the legal frameworks required to support PPPs. However, much still needs
to be done to ensure the appropriate and effective implementation of these frameworks. To implement a successful PPP
program, Uganda must constantly seek guidance from the lessons of her own experience with the various projects it
has implemented, combined with best practices from other countries. In summary, there are six key lessons that must
be at the forefront of action in facilitating changes necessary to implement successful PPPs 24.
