About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      BuildCo will request a soil test for the structural calculations for the
      foundation. Contractors ask for a soil test to ensure that the foundation of
      the building is solid. The engineer must understand the suitability of the soil
      for the proposed construction work. It allows to build a solid foundation and
      avoid structures to be damaged or collapsed or leaned. A soil test is
      required by law and conducted in practice.

      The plans for the System of Use by the client are also required, so that Luz
      de Sur can verify that the customer's installation will not cause a failure in
      the distribution network system. Similarly, the client has to mention the
      closest point of connection to con rm the exact location of the applicant's
      property -this is especially relevant because sometimes the addresses are
      just a lot number. The documents do not have to be notarized.
      After receiving the application Luz del Sur prepares the budget that indicates
      the technical-economic conditions to be ful lled and the execution of works
      to be performed by the electricity company. The budget is valid for 30 days.
      During this period the parties can sign the contract.

      The client pays the budget, then presents the project of "System of Use"
      which include plans, description of the project and technical speci cations
      and, when approved, he has to inform the utility when to initiate the
      construction. If the supply is regulated (the current limit is 2,500 KW ) Luz del
      Sur does the connection works. Luz del Sur does the external connection
      works from the existing network to the connection. The connection can be
      made to an existing substation or a new substation can be installed on the
      customer's property which is then to be connected to an existing medium
      voltage network. The time includes also the time to obtain the transformer.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      A Property Registry Certi cate (CRI, Certi cado Registral Inmobiliario) is
      obtained from the Property Registry to verify the existence and
      characteristics/description of the property (land and construction), the
      identity of the owner, and to check whether it is a clean title (free from
      attachments, mortgages, or any encumbrances of judicial or extra judicial
      nature).
      The notary will verify that the municipal taxes (Property Tax (Impuesto
      Predial) and Municipal services (public gardening, public parks, municipal
      police, garbage collection, other services)) have been paid. The information
      is obtained at the municipality by requesting a “cortado” at no cost and in 1
      day. The notary public must mention in the Public Deed related to the sale of
      real estate, the o cial document showing the cancelation of the Property
      Tax for all years.
      However, for the perfection of the transfer (Public Deed) it will require a
      Notary. The tax amounts to 1.61% of a Peruvian Tax Unit (T.U.). For Fiscal
      2017 (calendar year) the TU is PEN 4,050..



  2   The notary public executes the sale-purchase agreement                               1 day                 0.1-0.25% of property
      Agency : Notary Public                                                                                     value (Notary’s fees)

      The notary executes the sale-purchase agreement or 'minuta' and can
      deliver it for registration only through the public deed that the minuta and
      its legal attachments generate. Since the process to generate the public
      deed could take some time, principally for the obtaining of the di erent legal
      attachments, it is strongly recommended to le for a 'preliminary
      reservation' (bloqueo) on the property register. Known as the 'blocking' of
      the property registry, this measure protects the purchaser from any third
      party lings before the public deed is o cially led for registration, and can
      be requested by the Notary only with a copy of the minute while the public
      deed does not exist yet. The blocking of the Registry expires after 60 working
      days as of registration. Fees are subject to market values and conditions, the
      complexity of the transaction, promptness and availability of parties to
      comply with formalities and signing of the public deed, etc. a reasonably
      valid estimate could be:" 0.4-0.5% for transaction values of up to US$ 30,000.
      0.1-0.25% for transaction values above US$ 30,000 on a declining basis as
      transaction values increase. After paying the transfer tax (impuesto de
      alcabala) and verifying that the seller has made the last payment of
      municipal taxes, the Notary will prepare the o cial transcription of the
      minuta (Public Deed) in the Notarial Registry. The Notary veri es the identity
      of the parties, compliance with all mandatory formalities and as the case
      may be of corporate and civil Powers of Representation (powers of attorney)
      and proceeds to have the parties sign the Public Deed after which he himself
      signs thus authorizing the completion of the Public Deed as a public Notarial
      document. The document is ready for registration. It may be the same
      notary who takes the Deed to the Registry.

       (Servicio de Administración Tributaria, SAT). The tax agency SAT is connected
       with the notaries through the internet
       (https://www.sat.gob.pe/TF/default.asp) to facilitate the payment of
       municipal taxes (including the transfer tax called Alcabala). The payment can
       be made on behalf of a client by the notary instantaneously, and no physical
       visits or wait time is involved in this process. Nevertheless, the
       aforementioned payment may also be executed in Notaries with debit and
       credit card, or bank transfers since late 2008, due to notaries have been
       allowed to connect to SAT system through satellite connection. As soon as
       the transaction clears, the notary prints the receipt and hands it to the
       client.



       The payment can be made at:https://www.sat.gob.pe/TF/default.asp. This
       reform started back in 2005 under the name “NotarioSAT” with an objective
       of enabling the electronic payment and processing of Alcabala. In mid 2009,
       71 out of 104 notaries in Lima participated in this programme. The
       programme is web-based and easy to access.

       The transfer tax amounts to 3% of the highest value between the Municipal
       value of the property and the transfer value on the excess of 10 Tax Units
       (T.U.). The amount of 10 Tax Units (38,000 TU) shall be discounted from the
       tax basis. This tax is payable by the purchaser. Since January 2015, the TU is
       PES 3,950. Even if there is usually a di erence between the Municipal and the
       real value of the property, such di erences are not systematic.



       Since January 1st 2004, (non-juridical person) vendors must pay a capital
       gains tax levied on the di erence between the purchase price of the (non
       residence) property acquired as of January 1st, 2004 and the sales price of
       the same. The tax is 5% of the di erence in prices and it is an de nitive
       payment on the Income Tax (this only takes places if the property sold was
       acquired after 1/1/2004).

       According to the Regulation Public Registry Resolution N° 032-2010 of
       February 25, 2010, in the cases of simple transfers ("compra-venta simples")
       the Public Registry must record it in a maximum of 48 hours at no extra cost;
       according to the said Resolution in order to be considered as a simple
       transfer, the operation must ful lled the following requirements: (i) the
       operation must be related about a unique parcel properly registered, (ii) the
       procedure can only involves one electronic entry, and (iii) the seller must
       appear as owner in the Public Registry."



       When the client submits the transfer to SUNARP, SUNARP checks and veri es
       if the sale falls into this category. It then assigns the work to the relevant
       "seccion" (composed of one registrador, 2 assistants and one apprentice).
       Some "secciones" are speci cally assigned to this type of transactions. Also,
       standard minutes have been published in the website to promote their use.
       The legal framework of Peru does not allow providing incentives for
       employees. Regular registration of the public deed in the Property Registry
       takes a maximum of 35 working days, but during the rst 7 days of this term
       the Pubilc Registry is obliged to issue a notice regarding the situationof the

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding         liquidation         The Insolvency Law (Ley General del Sistema Concursal) regulates two types of proceedings:
                   (after an           the ordinary Insolvency proceeding (ordinary proceeding) and the preventive Insolvency
                   attempt at          proceeding (preventive proceeding). The ordinary Insolvency proceeding (ordinary
                   reorganization)     proceeding) is aimed at reorganizing the debtor's company, and once it commences, all
                                       individual enforcement actions against the debtor would be automatically suspended, a list
                                       of creditor’s claims is to be issued and a negotiation of a potential reorganization agreement
                                       will take place. However, because an agreement is rarely reached, the most probable
                                       scenario for the case at stake would be that the proceeding will be converted into a
                                       liquidation proceeding.

Outcome            piecemeal sale      Taking into consideration a that the reorganization proceeding will be converted into a
                                       liquidation proceeding, the hotel will cease operations and its assets will be sold separately

Time (in years)    3.1                 It would take about 3 years for a reorganization proceeding which is converted into
                                       liquidation in Peru. The negotiation stage will last 1.5 years, after which the liquidation
                                       proceeding will start, assuming that there won’t be an agreement with BizBank. After that a
                                       liquidator will be appointed and all measures will be observed in order to proceed with the
                                       judicial sale of the debtor’s assets. The liquidation stage will last an additional 1.5 years.

Cost (% of         7.0                 The costs associated with the reorganization proceeding which is then converted into a
estate)                                liquidation proceeding like in the case of Mirage would amount to approximately 7% of the
                                       value of the estate according to our estimate. The main component of this expenditure
                                       would be the attorney’s fees around 5%. The rest of the cost is represented by judicial and
                                       service fees and the fees of the insolvency administrator and the liquidator, which will
                                       amount 2% of the value of the debtor’s estate.
