About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                  leaves the domicile in the cases that are permitted by the legislature on the
                  grounds of custom or necessity. For example, she has the right to go out for

                  not con ict with the family’s interest, and her husband has not asked her to
                  abstain from going out to work. If it is established that her going out to work

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      The technicians review the request and determine which distribution
      network is closest to the warehouse. After the utility has determined the
      nearest network and paid the fees, the client will need to apply for an
      excavation permit at the district.

      Agency : South Cairo Electric Distribution Company (SCEDC)

      A SCEDC electrical engineer will inspect the site. The purpose of the
      inspection is to check whether there is enough capacity to provide the power
      needed and whether the property has any speci c requirements. The client
      does not have to be present at the inspection.
      Following that, the inspector prepares a report with an estimate of the
      connection fees.
      No inspection of the entire internal wiring is carried out during the process.
      The client must pay the estimated fees within one month, after which the
      estimate o er expires.

      The client needs to submit a copy of the building permit, a copy of the ID
      card, and a tax statement.

  4   Obtain external works from SCEDC                                                     17 calendar days         EGP 77,000
      Agency : South Cairo Electric Distribution Company (SCEDC)

      External works can start when the client has paid the connection fees at the
      utility’s cashier and submitted the excavation permit to the utility.
      For loads below 500 kVA, the customer does not need to buy or pay for any
      material required for the external works or connection. Thus, whether an
      upgrade of the system (transformer is replaced with one of higher capacity)
      is needed or not will not a ect the total cost. However, if a substation is
      needed, the customer will be asked to build the room.
      For the electricity connection considered in the case study, there is no need
      for a substation. The external works will consist of laying out underground
      cables to the closest point of supply

      Following negotiations and an agreement on all material terms of the
      contract, the buyer pays the seller the requested price, and the buyer
      subsequently goes to the Real Estate Registry to request registration. At this
      juncture, the buyer pays the 2.000 EGP registration fee for the property over
      300 m2. The request is subsequently internally transferred to the Egyptian
      Surveying Authority to complete a survey of the land.

      The Egyptian Surveying Authority inspects the property, conducts a survey,
      and prepares a report "Kashf El Tahdid" of its ndings. The report contains a
      description of the property, its boundaries and its surface area. The report is
      subsequently delivered to the Measurement Department.

      Following the Egyptian Surveying Authority’s inspection, the report produced
      (called Kashf Tahdeed) must be approved by the Measurement Department.
      Additionally, the notary public at the Real estate registry will review the
      measurement report. It is only after the second review that the notary will
      approve the document to allow the lawyer to prepare the contract. The
      entire report is then internally transferred to the Real Estate Registry for
      acceptance of
      (1) the inspection report and
      (2) the request for registration. The Real Estate Registry also conducts an
      engineering and legal review of the request and grants approval by stamping
      the documents “approved to be authenticated” (maqbul " ‫)" ﻣﻘﺒﻮﻝ ﻟﻠﺸﻬﺮ‬. The
      approved documents are then released to the parties. At this stage, the

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                           largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                           second largest business city.
                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                           The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                         several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the          - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                      and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                          economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                         - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                         - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)               - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                         commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                         - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                  - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                 - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                   - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                         movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
