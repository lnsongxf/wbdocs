       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the results of the Service Delivery Indicators in the education sector in
Niger in 2015. Survey implementation was preceded by extensive consultation with
Government and key stakeholders on survey design, sampling, and adaptation of survey
instruments. Pre-testing of the survey instruments took place in 2013, while training of
field staff and field work took place in 2015, and data entry, cleaning, and analysis took
place in 2016 and 2017.

Information was collected from 256 primary schools, 1,748 teachers, and 3,661 grade four
and five pupils in Niger. The results provide a representative snapshot of primary
education service delivery in Niger. The survey provides information on four elements of
service delivery: measures of (i) teacher effort; (ii) teacher knowledge and ability; (iii) the
availability of key inputs and infrastructure; and (iv) management, supervision, and
community engagement.

What providers know
Pupils cannot learn more from their teachers than what the teachers know. On average,
primary school teachers who taught fourth grade in 2015/16 or third grade the previous
school year mastered 41 percent of an exam set at the lower primary level and zero percent
of the current-year fourth grade or previous-year third grade scored 80 percent or higher.
For all teachers and directors, 0.4 percent reached the threshold. Teachers in private and
rural public schools did better than their public or urban public peers.

What providers do (teacher effort)
During an unannounced visit, 16.6 percent of teachers were not at their school during and a
further 10.4 percent were at their school, but not in their classroom. However, once in the
classroom, teachers taught the majority of the time, meaning that pupils receive 77.3
percent of the scheduled teaching time. This is the highest rate among countries that have
done an SDI.

What providers can use (availability of key inputs)
The observed pupil-teacher ratio in grade 4 averaged 38 pupils per teacher, slightly below
than the 40 pupils that is the norm in Niger. There are important input deficiencies that
make teaching more difficult. Approximately one in five schools (19.7 percent) had the
minimum infrastructure, primarily because one school in four (24.3 percent) has
functional, private, and accessible latrines. Similarly, 24.7 percent of schools have the
minimum teaching equipment, primarily because pupils lack exercise books (8.9 percent
availability). These are often cited as primary constraints to performance by public school
directors.

Ownership matters
Private schools offered better service delivery than public schools in all areas except
teachers meeting the minimum knowledge threshold (all had zero percent). Differentials
were highest in pupil outcomes, followed by teacher absence, and then input availability.
The private sector, which is small and concentrated in urban areas, offers a different

                                               vii
education than the public sector. Despite a disadvantage of being measured at the start of
fourth grade rather than later in the year, private school children perform on par with
those from Kenya, a middle-income country. Kenya has the highest average student
performance observed among SDI countries. However, public school children are worst
among those evaluated. Comparing the rising fifth graders to their fourth-grade peers from
other countries, they only surpass Nigeria and Mozambique.

Geographic and gender differences among public schools
Except for class size, rural pupils are at a disadvantage compared to their urban peers in all
areas. Combined with other factors, this translates into significantly lower scores on the
learning evaluation. Girls do worse than boys in the tests, and the effects are cumulative:
rural boys do worse than urban ones and rural girls do the worst. Among regions, students
in Niamey generally do the best on almost all French items and some in mathematics in
grade four. In French, Maradi region does the worst, while it is Dosso in mathematics. For
grade 5, the situation is somewhat different, but the same regions do worst in the same
areas.

Leadership and management
School directors are the ministry’s first supervision agents and are most directly able to
monitor teaching. However, there are important variations in supervision across private,
urban public, and rural public schools. Directors’ evaluation of teacher performance was
more likely to include direct teacher observation, teacher absence rates, and student
learning in private than in public schools. Within public schools, urban school directors pay
more attention to these aspects than rural school directors. When asked, teachers report
similar patterns of comments from their directors’ supervision.

Supervision
External supervision is similar to leadership and management in that the private and public
schools differ. In private, supervisors are more likely to use templates and to observe
teaching. However, public school supervision is more likely to meet with the community, to
check inventory, and to review the latest school management committee annual report. The
pattern across urban and rural public schools mirrors that of private and public schools.
Private schools were the most supervised in the 2014/15 school year and urban public
schools had nearly twice the supervision of rural public schools.

Community engagement
Almost all primary schools (96.9 percent) have a school management committee although
not all are functional. School management committees are 1.5 times as likely to have an
action plan and 1.7 times as likely to have evaluated the action plan in private relative to
public schools. Urban public schools are more likely to have a school management
committee, an action plan, and an annual report than rural public schools.

How does Niger compare with other countries?
Table 3, below, compares Niger with other countries for all schools and Table 4 compares
for the public sector. In terms of teacher effort, Niger has a relatively lower absence rate
than the average of the other countries. This, combined with teacher behavior in class,
means that Niger ranks highest in terms of instructional time per day. However, teacher
knowledge is particularly low; it is the greatest differential among all the indicators.

Schools in Niger have the fewest teachers who reach the minimum knowledge threshold,
low absence rates (fourth-best), the second-lowest classroom absence rate (behind
Nigeria), the best teaching time per day, the second-lowest textbook availability (above
Uganda), and the lowest availability of infrastructure and teaching equipment. As noted
above, generally, students in Niger have among of the worst learning outcomes of the SDI
surveys.

         INTRODUCTION
Niger is a large landlocked country with a territory of 1.27 million km2 of which more than
three-quarters is covered by desert. Niger is situated in the West-Central part of the African
continent, and located between Mali, Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, and Burkina Faso.
The country has a population of about 17.1 million (2012 census), which is growing rapidly
at 3.5 % per annum. Child mortality in Niger has started to decline, but the fertility rate is
still very high leading to significant population growth. The United Nations projects that the
population in Niger will increase to approximately 22 million in 2020. Most of the country
has low population density, and the majority of the population is concentrated in a third of
the territory, mainly in the southern and western regions of the country. The majority of the
population lives in rural areas (82%). Women make up 49.7% of the total population, and
almost half of the population (49%) is under the age of 15. According to official projections
(National Institute of Statistics, INS, 2010), the number of children aged 7 to 12 rose from
1.85 million in 2001 to 2.35 million in 2008, and is expected to reach 3.38 million in 2020.
The number of children of primary school age is thus expected to increase by 43% between
2008 and 2020 leading to a large increase in the demand for education services, which is
expected to put a significant pressure on the Niger educational system by 2020.

Niger is a poor country. In the latest available UNDP Human Development Index (2014), it
was ranked last, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$897 in 2015 in Parity
Purchasing Power ($2011) terms- one of the lowest in the world. The country remains
relatively fragile and continues to be affected by several adverse weather conditions 1 and
other factors, which represent real obstacles to its harmonious development (59.5% of its
population lives below the poverty threshold): (a) adverse weather conditions lead to
recurrent drought in the northwestern and western areas where for several years there have
been successive famines and an increase in vulnerability. This insecurity affects both the
supply and demand for schooling and limits potential learning achievements; (b) instability
in countries of the sub-region and in the Sudano-Sahelian strip affects the border areas
(exposure to violent incidents: conflicts and terrorism) and undermines the government
development efforts. Nonetheless, the exploitation of Niger‘s significant mineral and oil
resources could provide important economic opportunities, if well managed.

Economic growth is highly volatile due to the dependence on rain fed agriculture.
Agriculture and livestock, which contribute respectively to about 28% and 11% of GDP,
provide livelihood for the majority of the population. The high dependence on agriculture
contributes to fluctuations in Niger’s economic growth. Over the last five years the annual
growth of Niger’s GDP has been as low as 2.3 percent in 2011 and reached a high of 11.8
percent in 2012, with an average annual growth rate of 6 percent. Despite an average
economic growth above the population growth and thus overall economic growth per
capita, the distribution of income is likely to have resulted in a smaller effect on poverty
reduction than average growth would have justified. This is due to the uneven distribution
1 About 80 % of Niger’s population depends on rain-fed agriculture and livestock and only about 12 % of all its land is

arable.

                                                             3
of income, as the majority of the population relies on the agricultural sector, which has
experienced a more modest growth. Furthermore, population grows at a faster rate in rural
areas leading to significant lower income growth per capita in rural areas.

The education system in Niger consists of three years of pre-primary school, followed by six
years of primary education, then four years of lower secondary education, and three years
of upper secondary education, which ends with a baccalaureate. Graduates from lower
secondary school can chose to continue with technical and professional education, which is
divided into upper technical secondary education of three years and professional training of
two or three years. Graduates from upper secondary can continue to higher education
including university, where the number of years of education depends on the program.
Primary education is mandatory, and the school enrolment age is seven years. Gross primary
enrollment rates in Niger were at 72.5 percent in 2015, with boys (77.9 percent) fully 11.1
percentage points more likely to be enrolled than girls. 2 In its policy framework, the
Government considers the six years of primary education and the four years of lower
secondary education as basic education. The objective is to provide universal access to this
level and ensure that graduates from basic education have the required skills needed to
function as productive members of society.

Education is, for the most part, provided by the public sector. As is the case for most Sub-
Saharan African countries, the public sector provides most of the education in Niger. Only
3.3% of primary enrollment was in private schools in 2014. The Ministry of National
Education (Ministère de l’Education Nationale, de l’Alphabétisation et de la Promotion des
Langues Nationales - MEN) is responsible for preschool, primary education (public and
private), and literacy and non-formal education (literacy, Koranic schools), while the
Ministry of Professional Training and Employment (Ministère de la Formation Professionnelle
et de l’Emploi – MFPE) manages technical and vocational (public and private) education, and
the Ministry of Secondary and Tertiary Education, Research and Technology (Ministère des
Enseignements Moyens et Supérieur et de la Recherche Scientifique – MESSRT) manages
general secondary, university education, as well as national and international training and
research centers located in Niger. Each of the three ministries has a regional departmental
headquarter located in each of the eight regions of the country managing issues related to
the sector under their jurisdiction.

The education system in Niger faces a number of challenges. A high population growth rate,
low initial enrollment rates, and lack of retention are among the factors preventing Niger
from achieving universal primary education coverage and completion. In particular, Niger
faces challenges to increase access and completion among vulnerable groups including girls
in rural areas, children in nomadic areas, and children with disabilities. Other key related
issues are the poor quality of learning and management of the education system. In addition
to these structural issues, the country’s vulnerability to frequent weather shocks has impacts
on the education sector.

Despite significant increase in enrollment ratios, gross enrollment in primary education is

still low in Niger compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries. Implementation of the
previous ten-year strategy, i.e. the Programme Décennal de Développement du Secteur de
l’Education (PDDE), formulated by the Government at the beginning of the last decade and
covering 2003-2013, has resulted in increased enrollment at all levels of education. Over
the last decade, the gross enrollment rate for primary education doubled in Niger going
from 36% in 2001 to 76% in 2011. This significant growth has been supported by
increased priority to primary education in the budget, extensive construction and
rehabilitation of schools, and recruitment of teachers. However, despite the massive
enhancement, enrollment rates are still quite low compared to other countries in the
region, 3 due to a combination of low initial access for vulnerable populations, pointing to
important inequities in the system, and low overall retention (overall and more
particularly for vulnerable groups).

The report is structured as follows: Box 1, below, presents the analytical underpinnings of
the indicators and the way in which they are organized. Box 2 provides additional
information on the SDI program and a detailed description of each indicator. Section 2
covers implementation and the SDI education methodology. Results are presented and
analyzed in Section 3 and Section 4. The report concludes with analyses of implications for
Niger and a comparison between the Niger results and those of other countries that have
done SDI.

Box 1. Analytical Underpinnings
Service delivery outcomes are determined by the relationships of accountability between
policymakers, service providers, and citizens (Figure 2, World Bank 2004). Human development
outcomes are the result of the interaction between various actors in the multi‐step service delivery
system, and depend on the characteristics and behavior of individuals and households. While delivery
of quality education is contingent foremost on what happens in classrooms, a combination of several
basic elements have to be present in order for quality services to be accessible and produced by
teachers at the frontline, which depend on the overall service delivery system and supply chain.
Adequate financing, infrastructure, human resources, material, and equipment need to be made
available, while the institutions and governance structure provide incentives for the service providers
to perform.

policymakers




Service Delivery Production Function
Consider a service delivery production function, f, which maps physical inputs, x, the effort put in by
the service provider, e, as well as his/her type (or knowledge), θ, to deliver quality services into
individual level outcomes, y. The effort variable e could be thought of as multidimensional and thus
include effort (broadly defined) of other actors in the service delivery system. We can think of type as
the characteristic (knowledge) of the individuals who are selected for a specific task. Of course, as
noted above, outcomes of this production process are not just affected by the service delivery unit,
but also by the actions and behaviors of households, which we denote by ε. We can, therefore, write
                                               y = f(x,e,θ) +ε
To assess the quality of services provided, one should ideally measure f(x,e,θ). Of course, it is
notoriously difficult to measure all the arguments that enter the production, and would involve a huge
data collection effort. A more feasible approach is therefore to focus instead on proxies of the
arguments which, to a first‐order approximation, have the largest effects.

Indicator Categories and the Selection Criteria
There are a host of data sets available in education. To a large extent, these data sets measure inputs
and outcomes/outputs in the service delivery process, mostly from a household perspective. While
providing a wealth of information, existing data sources (like Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS), Welfare Monitoring Surveys (WMS), and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey
(CWIQ)) cover only a sub‐sample of countries and are, in many cases, outdated.

Box 1. Analytical Underpinnings (continued)
The proposed choice of indicators takes its starting point from the recent literature on the economics
of education and service delivery, more generally. Overall, this literature stresses the importance of
provider behavior and competence in the delivery of education services (as opposed to water and
sanitation services and housing that rely on very different service delivery models). Conditional on
service providers exerting effort, there is also some evidence that the provision of physical resources
and infrastructure has important effects on the quality of service delivery.

The somewhat weak relationship between resources and outcomes documented in the literature has
been associated with deficiencies in the incentive structure of school and education systems. Indeed,
most service delivery systems in developing countries present frontline providers with a set of
incentives that negate the impact of pure resource‐based policies. Therefore, while resources alone
appear to have a limited impact on the quality of education in developing countries, it is possible
inputs are complementary to changes in incentives, so coupling improvements in both may have large
and significant impacts (see Hanushek, 2006). As noted by Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2011), the fact
that budgets have not kept pace with enrollment, leading to large pupil‐teacher ratios, overstretched
physical infrastructure, and insufficient number of textbooks, etc., is problematic. However, simply
increasing the level of resources might not address the quality deficit in education without also taking
providers’ incentives into account.

SDI proposes three sets of indicators: (i) provider effort; (ii) knowledge of service providers and (iii)
availability of key infrastructure and inputs at the frontline service provider level. Providing countries
with detailed and comparable data on these important dimensions of service delivery is one of the
main innovations of the Service Delivery Indicators.

Additional considerations in the selection of indicators are (i) quantitative (to avoid problems of
perception biases that limit both cross‐country and longitudinal comparisons), (ii) ordinal in nature
(to allow within and cross‐country comparisons); (iii) robust (in the sense that the methodology used
to construct the indicators can be verified and replicated); (iv) actionable; and (v) cost effective to
collect.

 Box 2. The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) Program

 A significant share of public spending on education is transformed to produce good outcomes at
 schools. Understanding what takes place at these frontline service provision centers is the starting
 point in establishing where the relationship between public expenditure and outcomes is weak within
 the service delivery chain. Knowing whether spending is translating into inputs that teachers have to
 work with (e.g. textbooks in schools), or how much work effort is exerted by teachers (e.g. how likely
 are they to come to work), and their competency would reveal the weak links in the service delivery
 chain. Reliable and complete information on these measures is lacking, in general.

 To date, there is no robust, standardized set of indicators to measure the quality of services as
 experienced by the citizen in Africa. Existing indicators tend to be fragmented and focus either on final
 outcomes or inputs, rather than on the underlying systems that help generate the outcomes or make
 use of the inputs. In fact, no set of indicators is available for measuring constraints associated with
 service delivery and the behavior of frontline providers, both of which have a direct impact on the
 quality of services that citizens are able to access. Without consistent and accurate information on the
 quality of services, it is difficult for citizens or politicians (the principal) to assess how service
 providers (the agent) are performing and to take corrective action.

 The SDI provides a set of metrics to benchmark the performance of schools in Africa. The Indicators
 can be used to track progress within and across countries over time, and aim to enhance active
 monitoring of service delivery to increase public accountability and good governance. Ultimately, the
 goal of this effort is to help policymakers, citizens, service providers, donors, and other stakeholders
 enhance the quality of services and improve development outcomes.

 The perspective adopted by the Indicators is that of citizens accessing a service. The Indicators can
 thus be viewed as a service delivery report card on education. However, instead of using citizens’
 perceptions to assess performance, the Indicators assemble objective and quantitative information
 from a survey of frontline service delivery units, using modules from the Public Expenditure Tracking
 Survey (PETS), Quantitative Service Delivery Survey (QSDS), and Staff Absence Survey (SAS).

 The literature points to the importance of the functioning of schools and more generally, the quality of
 service delivery. The service delivery literature is, however, clear that, conditional on providers being
 appropriately skilled and exerting the necessary effort, increased resource flows for health can indeed
 have beneficial education outcomes.

 The SDI initiative is a partnership of the World Bank, the African Economic Research Consortium
 (AERC), and the African Development Bank to develop and institutionalize the collection of a set of
 indicators that would gauge the quality of service delivery within and across countries and over time.
 The ultimate goal is to sharply increase accountability for service delivery across Africa, by offering
 important advocacy tools for citizens, governments, and donors alike; to work toward the end goal of
 achieving rapid improvements in the responsiveness and effectiveness of service delivery.

       Methodology and Implementation
The SDI indicators draw information from a stratified random sample of 256 schools,
comprised of 223 public and 33 private schools. This sample provides a representative
snapshot of the learning environment in both public and private schools. The standard SDI

                                                       8
survey instruments were adapted to the Nigerien context through a participatory process
involving technical discussions, training, and piloting with the Ministry of Education and
the National Statistical Institute (Institut National de la Statistique; INS). The survey was
implemented by INS with support and supervision from the World Bank’s Service Delivery
Indicators (SDI) team. The modules of the survey instrument are shown in Table 6 below.

Table 6. Survey modules
          Module                    Description
 1.   School information            Administered to the director to collect information about school
                                    type, facilities, school governance, number of pupils, and school
                                    hours. Includes direct observations of school infrastructure by
                                    enumerators.
 2.   Teacher information and       Administered to director and individual teachers to obtain a list of
      absence                       all school teachers, to measure teacher absence and to collect
                                    information about teacher characteristics. Includes an
                                    unannounced visit (Module 2B) to evaluate absence using the
                                    best known method from research on the subject.
 3.   Governance,                   Administered to the director to collect information about school
      management, and               functioning and the role of the director.

 4.   Classroom observation         Information on teaching activities, classroom conditions;
                                    collected through direct observation in the classroom.
 5.   Pupil assessment              Test of randomly selected grade-four pupils to measure their
                                    learning outcomes in mathematics and language.
 6.   Teacher assessment            Evaluation of teachers’ subject knowledge (mathematics and
                                    language) and teaching skills.

In 2014, parents could send their students to public (96.4 percent of primary students),
private (3.3 percent), or community (0.2 percent) schools, and could choose between the
traditional (86.6 percent of students) and Koranic (médersa; 12 percent) curricula, with very
limited experimental (1.2 percent) or special-needs (0.2 percent) places. For reasons of
comparability across countries, the survey uses the schools teaching traditional curriculum,
which represents nearly 87 percent of students. The region of Diffa was declared to be in a
state of emergency by the Government of Niger, and was therefore removed from the sample
frame as were Tesker, Tassara, and Tillia (localized insecurity) and Bilma (few schools,
massive distances). The final sample frame contained all public and private primary schools
in Niger which taught a traditional curriculum and were neither experimental nor special-
needs. Further details on the sampling procedure are in Annex 1.

Table 7 provides details of the sample for the Education Service Delivery Indicators. The
survey involved 256 primary schools, of which 87 percent were public schools and the
remaining 13 percent either private for-profit or private not-for-profit schools. The survey
assessed the knowledge of 1,604 primary school teachers, surveyed 1,748 teachers as part
of the study of the absence rate, and observed 255 grade four lessons. In addition, learning
outcomes were measured for 1,938 grade four pupils.

        RESULTS
A. Teacher effort

Absence from school
 During the first announced visit, a maximum of ten teachers are randomly selected from the list of all
 teachers who are on the school roster. The whereabouts of these ten teachers are then verified in the
 second, unannounced, visit. Teachers found anywhere on the school premises are marked as present.

 The statistics are weighted, with the interpretation of the indicator being the percentage of teachers who
 are absent during an unannounced visit.


The indicators relating to teacher effort (Absence from school, Absence from class, and Time
spent teaching) and the differences in outcomes between public and private, and urban and
rural schools, respectively, are presented in Table 8. They are summarized in Figure 2,
which shows that out of 100 teachers approximately 64 percent of teachers were in class
teaching on a given day. Roughly one teacher in six (17 percent) is absent from school and
a further 10 percent were at school, but not in the classroom.

Table 8 shows that one teacher in six was absent on any given day in Niger. Private school
teachers are nearly 90 percent less likely to be absent from school and 57 percent less
likely to be absent from class than their public sector counterparts. Among public school
teachers, there is no notable difference between those in rural and urban areas. When the
head is absent, rural public school teachers are 6.68 times as likely to be absent, which is
similar to urban public school teachers (6.0 times). The finding that the head’s absence is
positively correlated higher teacher absence is consistent across countries that have done
SDI. When looking at absence rates, 54 percent of schools have all teachers present during
the unannounced visit.

strike (24 percent) and gone to collect salary (23 percent). Niger’s high fertility rate is also
reflected in teacher absences: 11 percent of those absent are on maternity leave. Cultural
considerations are observed as well; 3.8 percent of absent teachers have gone to funerals.
Figure 3. Reasons why teachers are absent from school (percent)




Absence from class

 The indicator is constructed in the same way as the school absence rate indicator, with the exception that
 now the numerator is the number of teachers who are either absent from school, or present at school but
 absent from the classroom. A small number of teachers may be found teaching outside, and these are
 marked as present for the purposes of the indicator. The interpretation of the indicator is the percentage
 of teachers who are absent during an unannounced visit.


On any given day, 27 percent of teachers are not in the classroom, with urban public school
teachers five percentage points more likely to be absent than their rural counterparts
(Table 8). Public school teachers are far more likely to be absent from school than their
private counterparts (p<0.01), but are relatively less likely to be at school and not teaching
(p<0.01 still). As Table 27 shows, compared to private school teachers, civil servants are
8.6 times more likely (p<0.01) to be absent from school and contractual teachers are 13.8
times more likely (p<0.01). Also, civil servants and contractual staff are more likely to be
absent from class than private school teachers (p<0.01). Niamey has the highest levels of
absence, but statistically only Agadez and Tahoua show differences for absent from class
and absent from class, at school (p<0.10 in all cases; Table 28).

The comparison of absence from school and absence from class shows that nearly two-thirds

                                                     12
of the absence rate of teachers from the classroom is driven by absence from the school.
Estimates for absence from school, absence from class, and absence from class, at school,
broken down by teacher type are in Table 27. Unsurprisingly, private school teachers are
statistically significantly more likely to be present than any other teacher category,
however their absence from the classroom is primarily due to teachers who are at school,
rather than those who do not show. 4

The primary education system in Niger creates teacher absence because they are not paid
into bank accounts, but rather at centralized locations. Once extrapolated to the population,
teachers in Niger require a day to collect their salaries, based upon their declarations.
While there should be a definite end-of-month pattern, the survey time period only gives
one end of month (November) and the pattern is not so clear in the data (Figure 4).
Likewise, a Wald test of the significance of the day dummies in the regressions reported
below shows they are jointly insignificant. Even the 27 November dummy has a p-value of
0.439.

Figure 4. Teacher absence rate by second visit date (%)




Note: data are weighted.

Table 31 reports regression models of absence from school and the classroom for teachers
in all schools. The information is shown graphically in Figure 5. These models demonstrate
correlations, rather than causations, but still offer information to be considered.

There are four broad categories of variables in the models: (i) teacher-specific variables,
(ii) school-specific variables, (iii) ministry supervision variables, and (iv) school

4   For more information on the characteristics and absence rates of teachers, see Table 30.

                                                              13
management committee variables. Looking at the results, items related to oversight and
personal incentives seem to be the most important aspects.

Frequent pay delays do not motivate someone to work and the regression results show that
an additional standard deviation in delays (1 month) is associated with seven percent of an
additional standard deviation of absence (1.06 percentage points; p<0.05). Other personal
variables, such as gender, contractual status, and school headship are not statistically
significantly related.

Among school-level variables, having an absent head means a teacher is 25 units more
likely to be absent from school (p<0.10) and 28 units more likely to be absent from the
classroom (p<0.01). Having teaching resources, in the SDI sense, is associated with a 4.8-
unit decrease in absence from school (p<0.10). Poverty, rural/urban breakdowns, school
ownership, and peers do not have a statistically-significant correlation in these models.

Supervision by the ministry has significant correlations with absence. Use of a supervision
worksheet, is associated with a five-unit drop in absence from school (p<0.05) and a nine-
unit drop in absence from class (p<0.01). When supervisors observed class, the correlation
with absence is positive, both for school (7 units, p<0.01) and class (8 units; p<0.01). While
this may seem paradoxical, if supervisors do not observe each time, teachers may expect
lower intensity in later visits and therefore take advantage.

Finally, the involvement of the community matters. Relative to an inactive committee, a
moderately active one, as defined by the principal, is associated with a 13.6-unit decrease
in absence from school (p<0.01) and a 9.8-unit decrease in absence from the classroom
(p<0.10). For the latter, a highly-active committee is also statistically significantly
correlated with a decrease in absence, by 7.9 units (p<0.10).

Note: estimates from weighted models are expressed in standard deviations of the dependent variable. The dot

30.


Time spent teaching per day
  This indicator combines data from the staff roster module (used to measure absence rate), the classroom
  observation module, and reported teaching hours. The teaching time is adjusted for the time teachers are
  absent from the classroom, on average, and for the time the teacher teaches while in classrooms based
  on classroom observations.

  While inside the classroom distinction is made between teaching and non-teaching activities. Teaching is
  defined very broadly, including actively interacting with pupils, correcting or grading pupil's work,
  asking questions, testing, using the blackboard, or having pupils working on a specific task, drilling, or
  memorization. Non-teaching activities is defined as work that is not related to teaching, including
  working on private matters, maintaining discipline in class, or doing nothing and thus leaving pupils not
  paying attention.

  The interpretation of the weighted indicator is the percentage of time taught in fourth-grade classrooms
  in an average day when accounting for absence from the classroom.


This indicator measures the amount of time a teacher spends teaching in a school during a
normal day. It is calculated by recording the reported scheduled time of a teaching day
from school records, i.e., five hours and 40 minutes after break times (Table 8). This

                                                            15
number is multiplied by the proportion of teachers absent from the classroom. The idea
being that if 10 teachers are supposed to teach five hours and 41 minutes per day, but
2.7 of them are absent from either the school or the class at any one time, then the
scheduled teaching time is reduced to four hours and 23 minutes (five hours and 40
minutes x 0.775).

On average in Niger, a teacher will teach for four hours and 23 minutes (Table 8). That is,
teachers teach approximately 77.5 percent of the scheduled time (the reported
scheduled time for grade four pupils is five hours and 40 minutes after break times).
Table 8 reports some intermediate inputs used in the calculation of the indicator. Even
when in the class, however, teachers may not necessarily be teaching. The percentage of
the lesson lost to non-teaching activities is measured through observation of a grade four
lesson. 5 The distributions of the underlying variables are shown in Figure 6. Taken
independently, it appears that there is a group of teachers who are frequently absent from
the classroom, but that most teachers provide instruction the majority of time they are in
the classroom.

Table 8 also shows significant variation between public and private schools in teacher
effort, whether measured in terms of classroom time taught or net teaching time for
students. Private school teachers teach 95.3 percent of the time they are in class, which is
fully 28.7 percent (p<0.01) more than their public school counterparts. Accounting for
teacher absence and use of classroom time, private school students receive, on average,
25.6 percent more instruction per day than public school students (p<0.01), which
represents an additional one hour and four minutes per day. There is no significant
variation in the use of classroom time or overall teaching time between public schools in
rural and urban areas.

The phenomenon of classrooms without teachers, called “orphaned classrooms”, 6 is more
common in public than in private and in urban public than in rural public schools, but the
differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels except in the
public/private space. Public schools, with an 8.6 percent rate, are nearly four times as likely
to have orphaned classrooms as private schools (p<0.01), which have a 2.2 percent rate.




5 This is most likely an upper bound on the time devoted to teaching during a lesson; since presumably a teacher is more
likely to teach when under direct observation (i.e. Hawthorne effects will bias the estimate upward). During the
observation, enumerators first had to judge whether the teacher was teaching or not. If they judged the teacher to be
teaching, they were supposed to indicate how much time the teacher spent on any of the following teaching activities:
teacher interacts with all children as a group; teacher interacts with small group of children; teacher interacts with
children one on one; teacher reads or lectures to the pupils; teacher supervises pupil(s) writing on the board; teacher
leads kinesthetic group learning activity; teacher writing on blackboard; teacher listening to pupils recite/read; teacher
waiting for pupils to complete task; teacher testing pupils in class; teacher maintaining discipline in class; teacher doing
paperwork.
6 This is measured by inspecting the school premises, counting the number of classrooms with pupils, and recording

whether a teacher is present in the classroom or not. The share of orphaned classrooms is then calculated by dividing the
number of classrooms with pupils but no teacher by the total number of classrooms that contained pupils.

 Box 3. Assessment of knowledge of teachers
 This indicator measures teacher's knowledge and is based on mathematics and language tests covering
 the primary curriculum administered at the school level to all mathematics or language teachers that
 taught grade 3 in the previous year or grade 4 in the year the survey was conducted. It is calculated as the
 percentage of teachers who score more than 80 percent on the language and mathematics portion of the
 test. Efforts were made to include all possible teachers in the evaluation and those results are reported in
 the last part of this section.

 The indicator is representative of the average teacher in the universe of teachers in the country rather
 than the average teacher at the average school.


B. Teachers with minimum knowledge

The objective of the teacher test is to both evaluate mastery of basic and more advanced
reading, writing, and mathematical skills and to evaluate mastery of pedagogical skills.
Taken together, these are critical elements in the pupils’ acquisition of subject knowledge.
The basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills that lower primary pupils need to have in
order to progress further with their education are interpreted as the minimum knowledge
required for the teacher to be effective and serve as the basis for the "Share of teachers
with minimum knowledge” indicator.

While in some Anglophone countries, primary school teachers were specialized in language
or mathematics, in Niger, teachers taught all subjects in primary school. The test was
validated against the primary school curriculum of Niger and 12 other Sub-Saharan

The minimum knowledge indicator was calculated as the percentage of teachers who
scored more than 80 percent on the lower primary part of the language and mathematics
test (Table 9). The test also contained more advanced questions in both subjects, as well as
a pedagogy section. Satisfactory mastery of content knowledge among teachers in Niger
was among the lowest recorded across all SDI countries as zero percent of teachers of
grade 4 (2015/16 school year) and grade 3 (2014/15 school year) achieved a score of 80
percent or higher in the combined French and mathematics sections. Private school
teachers are not more proficient than their public school counterparts at the levels deemed
sufficient for proficiency or higher and only outperform when the standard is set at 70
percent of the possible points. The results are generally similar when all evaluated teachers
are included, even though the average score rises to 35.4 percent from 33.5 percent, and
0.4 percent of teachers reach the proficiency level. As the cumulative density plots in A

French

Table 10 shows that teachers successfully completed roughly one-half of the French
content on the evaluation. Overall, there is no significant different along ownership or
rural/urban within public lines. Private school teachers did better in grammar and
composition than public school teachers and urban public teachers did worse than rural
public teachers in composition.

Mathematics

Teachers who taught grade 3 in the year prior to the survey or grade 4 in the year of the
survey, correctly completed 26.7 percent of the basic mathematics examination (Table 11).
Private school teachers performed better than their public school counterparts in all
evaluation areas (p<0.1 or better, except for Venn diagrams), particularly in “advanced”
mathematics, which tested concepts beyond the primary school level. Unlike French, where
urban public school teachers generally outperformed their rural counterparts, there is no
statistical difference in mathematics. Urban teachers also generally outperform their rural
counterparts, although more in basic than advanced math.

Pedagogy

Although this component is not included in the minimum knowledge variable, it does
provide some insight into teachers’ ability to prepare and deliver lessons and evaluate
students. As with the other evaluation sections, private-school teachers perform better
than those in public school by 5.6 percent (p<0.05), and particularly in more advanced
pedagogical skills and class preparation (p<0.01 in both cases). There are no significant
differences among public school teachers by school location or between rural and urban
teachers in general.

A broader look at teacher knowledge using all teachers evaluated by the survey

This section uses the information on all teachers and principals evaluated, which differs
from the SDI indicator, which focuses on those who taught fourth grade the year of the
survey or third grade the year preceding the survey. As Figure 7 shows, the majority of
teachers in Niger scored between 20 and 60 percent on the evaluation, which is still
relatively far from the 80 percent minimum level to be deemed to have a sufficient level of
the primary curriculum.




                                                                20
Figure 7. Teacher evaluation cumulative distribution (all teachers)




Table 29 presents various breakdowns of teacher performance for all teachers evaluated.
Panel A provides the same comparisons as discussed above. There are few deviations from
the conclusions above. Private school teachers score 11.3 percent higher than public school
teachers on the evaluation (p<0.01), but statistically their level of mastery is equivalent and
closer to zero than any positive number. On average, private-school teachers perform
better in French (7.8 percent; p<0.1), math (31.7 percent; p<0.05), and pedagogy (142.7
percent; p<0.01). However, in a pattern that is repeated throughout Panel A, the public
(rural public, rural) teachers perform better on composition (27.2 percent; p<0.01 for
public). This is the only statistically-significant exception to the rule that private-school
teachers perform better, on average, at any task than their public-school counterparts.

The major difference with the smaller sample discussed above is that the differences
among all teachers are statistically more significant among public school teachers or across
rural and urban when all information is used. Among public school teachers, 0.5 percent of
those in rural reach the proficiency threshold compared to zero percent in urban (p<0.05),
but this is still very low. However, urban public performs statistically better in pedagogy
(69.4 percent, p<0.05), math (35.6 percent; p<0.01), and French (9.3 percent; p<0.01). The
same pattern is observed when comparing rural and urban; while rural teachers are more
likely to reach the minimum knowledge (0.5 percent; p<0.1), urban teachers perform
statistically better in pedagogy (83.7 percent, p<0.01), math (37.0 percent; p<0.01), and

                                              21
French (9.5 percent; p<0.01).

Panel B compares the teachers’ performance by contractual status and shows a cost of the
heavy reliance on contractual teachers in Niger (69.8 percent of teachers) as they perform
worst among the three categories. Civil servants uniformly outperform the contractual
teachers including by 13.3 percent in French (p<0.01), 32.1 percent in math (p<0.01). and
46.5 percent in pedagogy (p<0.01). Private school teachers are weaker than civil servants
in French (11.3 percent; p<0.05) and pedagogy (17.2 percent; p<0.1), but have a nearly
identical mathematics sub-aggregate.

Panel C breaks down teachers by their level of academic achievement. Teachers who
completed more education score better, but the change from no high school to some high
school seems more important than that of some high school to completed high school.
Looking across the sub-aggregates, teachers with a high school degree performed between
13 percent (French; p<0.01) and 40 percent (pedagogy; p<0.01) better than teachers who
had not reached high school. Teachers who had at least some high school education
perform better, but are still worse than teachers who completed high school in nearly all
areas. In French, the difference is 7.1 percent (p<0.05) and in pedagogy it is 18.8 percent
(p<0.01).

Panel D shows that teacher performance is generally positively correlated with the grade
taught (aside from first grade). The most notable impacts are felt in mathematics and
pedagogy. The effect appears to be nonlinear and asymmetric: comparing grades three and
five, the effect is larger for grade three; comparing grades two and six, the effect is larger
for grade six.

Panels E and F present comparisons of the effect of attending teacher training college and
the level of professional training attained. As with academic progression, higher teacher
certifications are positively correlated with higher teacher performance. Interestingly,
among levels of certification, it is not clear that attending teacher training college has a
significantly positive impact on the teacher’s performance. The best example in Panel E is
the comparison between the “ENII” and “CAP” columns, both of which report on teachers
who have achieved the highest certificate for teaching primary school. Those who did not
attend ENI (“CAP”) generally do as well as those who did, and in a few cases (Grammar,
Venn diagrams, pedagogy, and basic pedagogy) actually do better. Panel F compares across
those who attended and those who did not and also shows that there is generally not a
statistically-significant difference among the two populations.

Panel G shows that recruitment, over time, has diluted the level of knowledge of teachers.
Teachers hired before 2000 score higher in all evaluation areas, particularly mathematics
and pedagogy (p<0.01 for all items but the Cloze task). Likewise, teachers hired before
2008 score better than those hired after on all items but the Cloze task with highly
significant differences (p<0.01). Figure 14 shows this graphically, with a globally negative
evaluation performance trend for teachers hired after 2000 until those hired in 2015.
When looking at the data, teachers hired before 2000 were more likely to have completed
high school (14 percent vs. six percent) or further education (17 percent vs. four percent;

                                              22
p<0.01 for the cross-tabulation). This likely also reflects the rapid expansion of the
education system in a context of insufficient human resources, which then repeats itself as
new generations of teachers are recruited from the system.

C. Availability of inputs at the school

 Functioning school infrastructure: minimum infrastructure resources is a binary 0-1 capturing
 availability of: (i) functioning toilets operationalized as being clean, private, and accessible; and (ii)
 sufficient light to read the blackboard from the back of the classroom.

 Functioning toilets: whether the toilets were functioning was verified by the enumerators as being
 accessible, clean, and private (enclosed and with gender separation).

 Electricity: functional availability of electricity is assessed by checking whether the light in the classroom
 works and gives minimum light quality. The enumerator places a printout on the board and checks
 (assisted by a mobile light meter) whether it was possible to read the printout from the back of the
 classroom.

 Availability of teaching resources: equipment availability is a binary variable equal to 1 if (i) the randomly
 selected grade 4 classroom has a functioning blackboard and chalk, (ii) the share of pupils with pens is
 equal to or above 90 percent, and (iii) the share of pupils with notebooks in that classroom is equal to or
 above 90 percent.

 Functioning blackboard and chalk: The enumerator assesses if there was a functioning blackboard in the
 classroom, measured as whether a text written on the blackboard could be read at the front and back of
 the classroom, and whether there was chalk available to write on the blackboard.

 Pencils/pens and notebooks: The enumerator counts the number of pupils with pencils or pens and
 notebooks, respectively. By dividing each count by the number of pupils in the classroom, one can then
 estimate the share of pupils with pencils or pens and the share of pupils with notebooks.

 Availability of textbooks: the indicator measures in one randomly selected grade 4 class the number of
 pupils with the relevant textbooks (mathematic or language conditional on which randomly selected class
 is observed), and divided by the number of pupils in the classroom.

 Pupil-teacher ratio: the indicator of teachers’ availability is measured as the number of pupils per teacher
 in one randomly selected grade 4 class at the school based on the Classroom Observation Module.



The indicators Availability of teaching resources, Functioning school infrastructure, Pupil-
teacher ratio, and Pupils per textbook are all constructed using data collected through
visual inspections of a grade four classroom and the school premises in each primary
school surveyed. Table 13 summarizes the findings.

set of indicators is in Table 26.

Functioning school infrastructure

 Minimum infrastructure resources is a binary variable capturing availability of: (i) functioning toilets
 operationalized as being clean, private, and accessible; and (ii) sufficient light to read the blackboard from
 the back of the classroom.

 Functioning toilets: Whether the toilets were functioning was verified by the enumerators as being
 accessible, clean, and private (enclosed and with gender separation).

 Electricity: Functional availability of electricity is assessed by checking whether the light in the classroom
 works and gives minimum light quality. The enumerator places a printout on the board and checks
 (assisted by a mobile light meter) whether it was possible to read the printout from the back of the
 classroom.


The minimum infrastructure indicator is four times more likely to be met in private than in
public schools (p<0.01). Despite this, only four in five private schools meet the
requirements for minimum infrastructure. This is driven primarily by the toilet, which is
not always private or functioning in public or private. However, private school pupils are
two to three times more likely to have a toilet that meets any condition (p<0.01). They are
also more likely to be able to read the board, whether measured by a lux meter or by the
interviewer’s perception. The differences between rural and urban public schools is less
pronounced for infrastructure, although urban schools are 16.7 percent more likely to have
minimum infrastructure than rural ones (p<0.01), primarily because they have more toilets
that are available (40.3 percent; p<0.01) or toilets that are clean (35.5 percent; p<0.01).
Even considering those factors, urban public schools are still 2.9 times less likely to meet
the minimum infrastructure indicator’s requirements than private schools.


                                                       24
Equipment availability is a binary variable equal to 1 if (i) the randomly selected grade four classroom
has a functioning blackboard and chalk, (ii) the share of pupils with pens is equal to or above 90
percent, and (iii) the share of pupils with notebooks in that classroom is equal to or above 90 percent.

Functioning blackboard and chalk: The enumerator assesses if there was a functioning blackboard in
the classroom, measured as whether a text written on the blackboard could be read at the front and
back of the classroom, and whether there was chalk available to write on the blackboard.

Pencils/pens and notebooks: The enumerator counts the number of pupils with pencils or pens and
notebooks, respectively. By dividing each count by the number of pupils in the classroom, one can
then estimate the share of pupils with pencils or pens and the share of pupils with notebooks.


Availability of teaching resources

SDI measures whether or not all elements of the minimum teaching resources are
simultaneously present in a given school rather than individual or average presence of the
elements. Minimum teaching resources is a pressing constraint. A visual presentation of
the co-availability of the inputs is in Figure 11.

The minimum teaching equipment indicator shows that private school pupils are 3.1 times
more likely to be in a school with all necessary elements (p<0.01), both because they are 10
percent more likely to have a pencil (p<0.01) and twice as likely to have an exercise book
(p<0.01), but also because the requirement to have those and a functional board
simultaneously are hard to meet in the public schools. Among public schools, there are
differences driven by the relative lack of pencils (-8.3 percent; p<0.01) and exercise books
(-30.8 percent; p<0.01) in rural areas. Interestingly, rural public classrooms were 28.3
percent more likely to have blackboards readable from the back of the class than urban
public classrooms (p<0.01).

Availability of textbooks
The indicator measures in one randomly selected grade 4 class the number of pupils with the relevant
textbooks (mathematic or language conditional on which randomly selected class is observed), and divided
by the number of pupils in the classroom.


At the end of the observation in French and mathematics classes, textbook availability was
directly measured by asking pupils to raise the textbook for the subject observed by the
field teams. In Niger, less than one in eleven pupils had the textbook for the class observed
(8.9 percent). Private school students fared better than public school students for both
subjects (p<0.05), but even they had a textbook only one-quarter of the time. Textbooks for
French were more available those for math in private and public irrespective of location.
Despite this, on average there are at least three children per book, even in the best case
(French in private schools). The general level of textbook availability is not significantly
different across public schools in rural and urban areas.

Pupil-teacher ratio
  The indicator of teachers’ availability is measured as the number of pupils per teacher in one randomly
  selected grade four class at the school based on the classroom observation module.


Fourth grade pupils in Niger have, on average and based upon direct observation, 37
classmates. Private school pupils are in larger classes than public school pupils (8.8
percent; p<0.01) as are urban public school pupils compared to their rural peers (12.2
percent; p<0.01). As Figure 8 shows, there is some variation in class size, but most schools
do not have the teaching resources and almost all schools do not have textbooks for their
pupils.

D. Assessment of pupil learning

It is instructive to think of the Service Delivery Indicators as measuring key inputs, with a
focus on what teachers do and know, in an education production function. These inputs
are actionable and are collected using objective and observational methods at the school
level. The outcome in such an education production function is pupil learning
achievement. While learning outcomes capture both school-specific inputs (for instance,
the quality and effort exerted by the teachers) and various child-specific factors (for
instance, innate ability) and household- specific factors (e.g. household welfare), and thus
provide, at best, reduced form evidence on service provision, it is still an important
measure to identify gaps and to track progress in the sector. Moreover, while the Service
Delivery Indicators measure inputs (learning outcomes are not part of the Indicators), in
the final instance we should be interested in inputs not in and of themselves, but only in as
far as they deliver the outcomes we care about. Therefore, as part of the collection of the
Service Delivery Indicators in Niger, learning outcomes were measured for grade four
pupils. This section reports on the findings.

The objective of the pupil assessment was to assess basic reading, writing, and arithmetic
skills. The test was designed by experts in international pedagogy and based on a review of
primary curriculum materials from 13 African countries. 8 The pupil assessment also
measured nonverbal reasoning skills on the basis of Raven’s matrices, a standard IQ
measure that is designed to be valid across different cultures. This measure complements
the pupil test scores in French and mathematics and can be used as a rough measure
to control for innate pupil ability when comparing outcomes across different schools. Thus,

8 For details on the design of the test, see Johnson, Cunningham, and Dowling (2012) “Draft Final Report, Teaching

Standards and Curriculum Review”.

the pupil assessment consisted of three parts: mathematics, French, and non-verbal
reasoning (NVR).

The test was examined by the Ministry of Education team for suitability in the local
context, judged acceptable after some minor modifications to maintain comparable
difficulty, and was administered to fourth- and fifth-grade pupils. The reason for the
choice of grade four pupils is threefold. First, there is no standardized national or
international evaluation of this level, although PASEC evaluates grades two and six
(previously: five). Second, the sample of children in school becomes more and more self-
selective as one goes higher up due to drop-out rates. Finally, there is growing evidence
that cognitive ability is most malleable at younger ages. It is therefore especially important
to get a snapshot of pupil’s learning and the quality of teaching provided at younger ages.

The test was designed as a one-on-one test with enumerators reading out instructions to
pupils in their mother tongue. This was done so as to build up a differentiated picture of
pupils’ cognitive skills, using oral one-to-one testing allows us to evaluate whether a child
can solve a mathematics problem even when her reading ability is so low that she would
not be able to attempt the problem independently. The French test consisted of a number
of different tasks including knowledge of the alphabet, word recognition, reading out loud,
and reading comprehension. The mathematics test contained tasks such as identifying and
sequencing numbers, addition of one- to three-digit numbers, one- and two-digit
subtraction, and single digit multiplication and divisions. The non-verbal reasoning section
consisted of four questions.

Fourth-grade pupils in Niger achieved an average score of 22.6 percent on the assessment
(Table 15), which means that children mastered, on average, one-fifth of the fourth grade
curriculum at the start of the year. While this may seem encouraging, the details are
sobering; one child in nine (11.2 percent) can read a simple sentence, less than one child in
two can do single-digit addition, two children out of five can do single-digit subtraction.
However, there are large differences between private and public school students and
between urban public and rural public school students. Generally speaking, private school
students do between twice and seven times as well as public school students in language
and mathematics until division (p<0.01 always). Likewise, urban public school students do
one-third to two-thirds better than rural public school students (p<0.01 for all except
double-digit subtraction and single-digit multiplication with p<0.05) through single-digit
multiplication. In terms of performance, there are three school systems: private, urban
public, and rural public.

When comparing across regions (Table 34), all regions do worse than Niamey (p<0.01
except Agadez, p<0.10). 9 All regions perform worse than Niamey in both language (p<0.01
uniformly) and mathematics (p<0.01 except for Tahoua). The differences are often large
and suggest that children in other regions are at a serious learning disadvantage compared
with those in Niamey.
9 For the rest of the section, Agadez will be ignored, since it has very few observations, which also corresponds to its

proportionally low student population. The regions were not strata for the sample, so there was no minimum count to ensure the
possibility of analyzing the data in this way.

Since the survey was done in the first few months of the 2015-16 school year, grade 5
students (CM1) were also evaluated with the same questionnaire. This allowed for a
comparison between new fourth graders and new fifth graders, who presumably had a
fourth-grade level. When comparisons are made, there are important gains from the fourth
grade year (pooling grades) as shown in Table 16. These gains are robust the way in which
the students are treated for analysis, indicating increased mastery of the material by
students a grade above their peers on average. However, even fifth graders do not perform
well on the evaluation, as shown in Table 33. After fourth grade, three children in five can
recognize a letter (61.1 percent), one in five (24.1 percent) can read a simple sentence,
three in five can do single-digit addition (57.1 percent), and one out of two can do single-
digit subtraction (49.8 percent). When comparing the results in Table 32 and Table 33, the
difference between public and private and rural and urban within public decreases over
time for language skills, but rises for mathematics which means that an extra grade of
instruction serves to reduce the language skills gap, but widens the mathematics skill gap.
Regional disparities follow similar patterns as for fourth grade (Table 35), but Tahoua and
Tillabéri are less different from Niamey in mathematics, rather than just Tahoua as was the
case in fourth grade.

Note: based upon 1,651 fourth-graders and 1,230 fifth-graders. The notation “SD” refers to a standard deviation and “Z-
score” is the standardized value, defined as (actual-mean)/SD. The gains from fourth grade compare the CM1 students
(new fifth graders) to the CE2 students (new fourth graders). The “split” columns treat each grade as a distinct population
and the Z-score is standardized with the grade 4 data. The “pooled” column treats all students as coming from the same
population and the standardization is relative to the pooled data. 10

The regressions reported in Table 36 (French) and Table 37 (math) and shown graphically
in Figure 9 provide some broadly suggestive results. Female pupils perform two (2.6)
standard deviations worse than their male peers in French (math) and the results are at
significant in math in all models (p<0,05). Completing grade 4 is associated with a
performance increase between eight and nine standard deviations in math and French
(p<0.01 in all models). For both subjects, a one-standard deviation increase in time on task
represents an eight-tenths of a standard deviation increase in learning (p<0.1). In French, a
one percent increase in poverty results in a three-tenths of a standard deviation decrease
in performance (p<0.05). In math, attending a private school is associated with a 36
standard deviation increase in the score (p<0.05). That is equivalent to 152 percent of the
mean student performance. The effect is language is also of a large magnitude, but is not
statistically significant.




10 When pooling, the variance estimates are generated using clusters at the school-grade level, which is accurate for the survey

design so long as there is only one class for each grade in the school. That is the case in 168 of the fourth grades and 101 of the
sixth grades. Not including the additional detail will likely overestimate the variance.

Note: the models are survey-weighted and the standard errors account for clustering by school and grade within the
school. Variables with an “(s)” are standardized; those with “(d)” are dummy (binary). The dummy for CE2 is relative to
CM1. The models are estimated in standard deviations of the dependent variables, language (1.24 points) and math (0.54
points). Poverty headcounts are from the poverty mapping results undertaken by the Institut National de la Statistique
and the World Bank (unpublished).


Table 17 presents breakdowns across gender and school location, while Table 18 breaks
down the data across gender and school ownership. Rural pupils, irrespective of gender,
perform significantly worse than urban boys (p<0.01 uniformly) and even urban girls
perform somewhat worse than their male classmates (p<0.1 for French). However, the
gender gap is smaller in rural than in urban. As highlighted in Figure 10, urban public
pupils have higher French and math skills than their rural counterparts. Comparing across
the various sub-items of the modules, urban public pupils score 50 percent better (average:
52 percent, median: 54 percent) on every evaluation sub-domain in French and
mathematics (p<0.01) except division, where the pupils are, on average, similar.
Controlling for school ownership, this represents a serious gap in learning outcomes for
rural pupils compared to urban ones.

When comparing public with private, the overall gaps are more pronounced, with private
school children scoring nearly three times more on any given learning evaluation module.
Looking at the ratio of private to public scores for a module, it is higher for girls in fourth
grade and for boys in fifth grade.

E. Incentives, leadership, and management

The Niger SDI survey tested a module on incentives, leadership, and management. The goal
of the module was to provide additional information on observed service delivery
strengths and weaknesses in the facilities. Work in education in Mozambique had showed
that directors’ knowledge of teacher absenteeism seemed unrelated to what was observed
in practice. However, work in a number of SDI surveys showed that the most significant
correlate of absenteeism, whether correlation or size, was the absence of the head of the
school or health facility. Therefore, this module was designed to gain additional knowledge
on the interplay of the formal institutional rules and the realities of the service delivery
units.

Leadership and management

School directors were asked, among other topics, about their management training, major
constraints, and teacher management. Nearly half of directors (42.7 percent) report having
received training in management, although nearly as many received it from teacher
training college (29.5 percent) as from peers and school inspectors (26.8 percent). Nearly
one in ten directors received such training during the 30 to 45-day training session for
teachers who did not go through the teacher training college. Private school directors (75
percent; p<0.01) were 1.8 times as likely as their public counterparts to have received
training although they were also 2.3 times as likely (58.3 percent; p<0.01) to have received
it from peers or education supervision missions than public school directors. Rural public
directors were 2.3 times more likely (40.3 percent; p<0.05) to have received their
management training from “other” than urban public directors.

Table 19 shows that there are clear differences in constraints across public and private.
Public schools cited infrastructure (p<0.01), teaching materials (p<0.01), and teachers;
private schools cited none (p<0.01), other, and autonomy (p<0.05). Within public schools,
the significant differences are equipment, which rural schools expressed more than three
times more than urban ones (p<0.10), and other which was more common for urban public
schools (p<0.01).

The school director and ministry are both responsible for the development of teachers. As
reported in Table 38, nationally, 33 percent of directors had individual performance
evaluation meetings with teachers and 22 percent of directors reported that supervision
missions had such meetings. Both for meetings organized by the director and those
organized by the external supervision, private schools emphasized more direct teacher
observation (p<0.05 director, p<0.01 external), teacher absence rate (p<0.01 director),
parent satisfaction (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), student learning (p<0.01 and p<0.05,
respectively), examination performance (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively), and teacher
willingness to improve (p<0.01 for directors). Among public schools, urban directors pay
more attention to student performance (p<0.05), but rural external supervisions pay more
attention to parent satisfaction (p<0.10) than urban ones. This is corroborated by what the
teachers say about the content of supervision by their directors: private school teachers
report higher comment rates on discipline in class (33.6 percent vs 9.9 percent; p<0.01), on
student evaluation (35.2 percent vs 7.8 percent; p<0.01), and on student attendance (22.7
percent vs. 6.5 percent; p<0.01). Among public schools, urban public school teachers report
higher frequencies of comments on discipline (14.8 percent vs 7.3 percent; p<0.01) and on
student evaluation (17.2 percent vs. 2.8 percent; p<0.01) than their rural counterparts.

The work done by school directors to supervise their teachers varies across ownership, but
not across location for public schools. As shown in Table 20, 30.9 percent of public school
teachers say they are supervised annually or less as compared to 10.1 percent of private
school teachers (p<0.01). At the other extreme, 64.4 percent of private school teachers say
they are supervised multiple times per week compared to 23.2 percent in public schools
(p<0.01). Interestingly, whether or not a director has teaching responsibilities does not
appear to influence the supervision outcomes statistically-speaking.

Supervision

These results are confirmed by the content of supervision visits, shown in Table 39. Private
schools were 33 percent more likely to have been supervised in 2014/15 (p<0.10) and
urban public schools had twice the number of supervision visits as rural public schools
(p<0.01). Compared to public schools, supervision in private schools is more likely to use a
template (46.4 percent; p<0.01), to observe teaching (80.6 percent; p<0.01), but less likely
to meet with the community (-89.1 percent; p<0.01), to check the inventory (-51 percent;
p<0.01), or to review the school management committee’s (SMC) latest annual report
(-38.3 percent; p<0.10). Among public schools, those in urban areas report higher template
usage (43.7 percent; p<0.01) and classroom observation (30.3 percent; p<0.10), but lower
rates of community meetings (-75.2 percent; p<0.01), verification of the SMC action plan (-
34.8 percent; p<0.05), reviewing the SMC’s latest annual report (-46.8 percent; p<0.01), or
debriefing the teachers (-18.3 percent; p<0.10).

The different training levels and constraints are also visible in how directors manage
challenges. Four questions were asked, each with four possible answers from which
directors had to select the one closest to what they would do. Table 21 shows the results,
which suggest that private school directors have more ability to take action and greater
resources than their public counterparts. Rural public directors face the greatest
challenges, but are firm when dealing with contractual teachers. Private school directors
are far less tolerant of school absences than their public school counterparts, whether it be
helping the teacher come to school (p<0.10) or tolerating it entirely (p<0.01). They are also
27 percent more likely to request a transfer for a contractual teacher (p<0.10) and will
again not tolerate the absence outright (p<0.01). They are also more likely to pay, or to
have teachers pay, for chalk or pens that the school requires (p<0.01) than to ask parents
(p<0.01). Among public schools, directors in rural areas are more likely to provide support
(p<0.01) or to tolerate the absence (p<0.01) of civil servants than their urban counterparts.
However, when dealing with school-contracted teachers, rural public schools are far less
tolerant than their urban counterparts (p<0.05). Finally, in urban public schools, directors
are 81.9 percent more likely to ask teachers to finance basic inputs than in rural areas
(p<0.01).

Community engagement

Schools exist to serve students and their parents, who are generally organized in
communities. Part of the governance mechanism of the education sector is the engagement
of the schools with their communities through various planning and oversight bodies.

Table 22 presents some elements of community engagement and oversight. Private schools
are half as likely to have a school management committee (SMC) than public ones (p<0.01),
but are 1.5 times as likely to have an action plan and 1.7 times as likely to have an annual
evaluation (p<0.01 for both). Among public schools, urban ones are more likely to have a
CGDES (p<0.01) with an action plan (p<0.01), and an annual report (p<0.01). The urban
schools are also more 3.8 times likely to have CDGES members who have attended higher
education (p<0.01), 1.2 times more likely to have members with primary education only
(p<0.10), and have 1.4 times as many female member (p<0.10). They are slightly more
likely to have a parent-teachers’ association (p<0.05), but average one less meeting per
year (p<0.01). Urban public schools are also more likely to share information about their
finances and purchases with their communities (p<0.01). Likewise, SMC members in the

                                                         36
private sector are more likely to have greater educational attainment (p<0.05 for primary
and p<0.01 for higher education, respectively).

         What does this mean for Niger?
The 2014-2024 Sector Strategy for Education and Training was designed as a successor to
the previous decennial strategy and had three objectives for primary education, namely to:
(i) improve access to basic education through increased supply of educational services
yielding greater geographic coverage of educational services; (ii) improve quality of
teaching; and (iii) improve sub-sector governance. At the same time, beyond improved
access, the ambition was to advance as far as possible towards universal completion by 2024,
which would require both an increase in access to education and an improvement of the
retention of students.

The system was, and remains, largely public with 2.35 percent of schools in the sample frame
identified as being private. Progress in the previous strategy period was significant, with
gross primary enrollment more than doubling to 76 percent (2011) from 36 percent (2001),
with corresponding levels of funding for education through the budget for teachers and the
construction or rehabilitation of schools. The expansion of the primary education system and
significant improvement in enrollment has resulted in higher enrollment of girls in primary
education. However, disparities still exist, and in 2011 the ratio of girls-to-boys enrollment
in primary education was 83.7% and dropout rates were higher for girls. Gender inequality

                                                                 37
in access to education is more pronounced in rural areas than in urban areas, and the
problem is particularly serious among poor girls living in rural areas. However, the overall
level of enrollment was still low compared to other countries in the region, both because of
low initial enrollment for certain groups and poor retention for all students.

Niger ranks last both at entry and exit from primary among the countries in the latest (2014)
round of the Programme d’Analyse des Systèmes Educatifs de la CONFEMEN (PASEC). This
suggests that beyond increasing resources and enrollment, there are quality dimensions that
need to be addressed. Among the dimensions of quality are access to materials, such as
textbooks and teacher guides, which are low in Niger. Other factors include the pupil-teacher
ratios, which at 39 in 2011 was below the Global Partnership for Education norm of 40.
However, there is variation across classrooms and the 2014/15 data show an average fourth
grade size of 48 pupils., but ranging from 34.7 in Zinder to 81 in Niamey. Teachers are an
important factor and the 2010 Education Sector Report suggested that teacher absenteeism
costs students more than 18 days of schooling per year. 11 The heavy use of contractual
teachers may not be a cost-saving measure if they still generate large budgetary pressures.
Cost containment could lead to a strategy of lower-cost teachers, which is likely to have
lowered the quality of teachers (Vargas and De Laat, 2003).

The results of these and other factors is that educational system in Niger shows clear
divisions in the dimensions of provider ownership (public/private) and location
(rural/urban). For inputs, private is superior to public in both infrastructure availability
(81 percent versus 20 percent, p<0.01) and teaching equipment availability (72 percent
versus 23 percent; p<0.01) while urban public is better than rural public for both
infrastructure (28 percent and 18 percent, respectively) and equipment (39 versus 20
percent, p<0.01). Although Niger is still primarily rural (83.7 percent; 2012 census), there
is greater pressure in urban public classrooms, where the pupil-teacher ratio is 12 pupils
higher than in rural classrooms (p<0.01). However, private school pupils have nearly nine
more classmates than their public peers (p<0.01).

These factors are compounded by generally weak levels of minimum knowledge; less than
one percent of teachers in Niger score 80 percent on an evaluation of their math and
French knowledge at the lower primary level. There is no difference between public and
private school teachers. There are clear differences in absence rates, no matter how they
are defined, primarily between public and private school teachers.

Table 23 shows that access to education is correlated to level of welfare; as parents are
able, they send their children to private schools. The survey does to allow for the
calculation of intra-generational effects, but looking at the relative performance of pupils
by school attendance, it is likely that those attending private schools will have higher levels
of human capital in the future and be better-equipped for life.

In the end, the education production function is designed to equip pupils with knowledge
and skills to either continue their education or to join the workforce. The situation depicted
in this report suggests that the overall weak levels and high inequality of pupil outcomes
remain the ultimate challenge for the system. Table 24 shows that the observed differences
between rural and urban remain even after removing private school pupils, whose
performance is much higher than their public school peers. The differences decrease by
approximately five percent in the average scores, but the same patterns remain, suggesting
that there are effectively three school systems in Niger. There is a very small private sector,
an urban public sector, and finally a rural sector. The three have very different
performances and inputs.

Comparing Niger with other countries that have done SDI

Table 3, above, compares Niger with other countries for all schools and Table 4 compares
for the public sector. In terms of teacher effort, Niger has a relatively lower absence rate
than the average of the other countries. This, combined with teacher behavior in class,
means that Niger ranks first on instruction time per day. However, teacher knowledge is
particularly low; it is the greatest differential among all the indicators.

Schools in Niger have the fewest teachers who reach the minimum knowledge threshold,
low absence rates (fourth-best), the second-lowest classroom absence rate (behind
Nigeria), the best teaching time per day, the second-lowest textbook availability (above
Uganda), and the lowest availability of infrastructure and teaching equipment. As noted
above, generally, students in Niger have among of the worst learning outcomes of the SDI
surveys.

                                                               39
Annex 1. Sampling
The sample frame was provided by the ministry and comprised all schools that were
expected to be functional for the 2015/16 school year (see Table 25).

Given the nature of instruction, all Koranic schools were excluded from the sample frame
(the écoles franco-arabes). This left 7,232 primary schools. The region of Diffa, which was in
a state of emergency, was also excluded from the sample; this removed 1 percent of the
student population from the frame as shown in Table 25. The population of interest was
defined as the universe of fourth graders enrolled in school. Only formally-recognized
primary schools are considered, excluding community schools and special-needs schools
(e.g. handicapped). Based upon the 2014/15 school year, the sample was drawn for rising
fourth graders. For sampling purposes, the frame contained the size of each grade in each
school, the administrative geography, and the physical geography (rural/urban). The
sample frame was divided into three strata: public rural, public urban, and private urban to
maximize within-group homogeneity. Eight private rural schools were excluded.

Notes: calculations based upon the 2014/15 school year for then-third graders (rising fourth graders for the
2015/16 school year). The “U” refers to urban, the “R” to rural, and the “T” to “total” populations.

Depending upon the concepts of interest, the sampling procedure is done in two (absence
rate, classroom observation) or three stages (pupils). In all cases, the first stage is the
drawing of schools independently and without replacement from the different strata. To
reflect the experience of the average student, a simple random sample was drawn in the
strata, with probability proportional to the size of the school, defined as the number of
third graders in 2014/5. This selected the school. Subsamples were drawn in the schools
as described below.

To calculate the absence rate, a secondary sampling frame of all teachers who work at the
school is prepared (Module 2A). The methodology requires ten teachers, or all those in the
school if it has less than ten teachers. If a school has more than ten teachers, a random
selection without replacement is undertaken where each teacher has equal probability of
being selected. This gives the inflation factor, or weight, for the teacher absence rate,
defined as the inverse of the product of the probability of selecting the school and the
probability of selecting a given teacher in the school.

For classroom observation, the secondary sampling frame is the number of fourth-grade

                                                             40
classrooms in use in the school (Module 1). A simple random selection with equal
probability of selection was undertaken if there was more than one relevant classroom in
the school, giving a probability weight for classrooms. This secondary sampling unit was
used for the selection of pupils, the third-stage sampling unit.

From the classroom selected for observation, the procedure is to draw up to ten pupils for
the evaluation of their learning outcomes (Module 5). The sample frame for the selection of
students for this was the teacher’s pupil roster updated to remove pupils not present on
the day of the first visit. A random selection without replacement and with equal
probability of selection was undertaken if there were more than ten pupils in the
classroom. A risk of pupils not returning after lunch was identified during pre-testing and
mitigated during piloting through two steps. The field teams were instructed to learn from
the teacher which sampled pupils might not return after lunch in order to minimize the risk
of truncating the lower tail of the performance distribution. In the same sample procedure,
the teams also drew three extra pupils that were kept in reserve in case one of the first ten
pupils was not available. A probability weight is calculated for these pupils as the inverse of
the product of the probabilities of selecting the school, the classroom, and the student and
is used to estimate pupil-related indicators.

The sampling strategy was designed to produce estimates that had 5 percent confidence
intervals for national, rural, and urban with a minimum power of 80 percent and an
approximate sample size of 250 facilities given budget constraints. The two-stage approach
retained was expected to give allow the differentiation of absenteeism estimates differ by
3.04 percentage points at the national level, 3.32 percentage points at the rural level, 5.67
percentage points at the urban level, and 8.59 percentage points at the regional level. Given
the very small size of the private sector, the confidence interval was expected to be larger.

Grading of teacher evaluations was done by the Laboratoire d'études et de recherches sur
l'émergence économique of the University Abdou Moumouni in Niamey. To ensure inter-
rater reliability, 15 percent of the sample was doubled-graded blindly. These were
monitored for quality using both pair-wise correlations and Cohen’s Kappa as measures of
reliability. Initial correlations were above 95 percent on the language and mathematics
sections and the Kappa scores were all significant. Problems identified by across graders
were corrected and used to identify broader potential problems that were also corrected.

  Annex 2. Definition of the Service Delivery Indicators in Education

School absence rate
Share of a maximum During the first announced visit, a maximum of ten teachers are randomly selected
of ten randomly       from the list of all teachers who are on the school roster. The whereabouts of these
selected teachers     ten teachers are then verified in the second, unannounced visit. Teachers found
absent from school    anywhere on the school premises are marked as present.

unannounced visit
Classroom absence rate
Share of teachers     The indicator is constructed in the same way as the school absence rate indicator,
who are present in    with the exception that now the numerator is the number of teachers who are either
the classroom         absent from school, or present at school but absent from the classroom. A small
during scheduled      number of teachers may be found teaching outside, and these are marked as present
teaching hours as     for the purposes of the indicator.
observed during an
unannounced visit
Time spent teaching per day (also known as Time on Task)
Amount of time a   This indicator combines data from the Staff Roster Module (used to measure absence
teacher spends     rate), the Classroom Observation Module, and reported teaching hours. The teaching
teaching during a  time is adjusted for the time teachers are absent from the classroom, on average, and
school day         for the time the teacher teaches while in classrooms based on classroom
                   observations While inside the classroom distinction is made between teaching and
                   non-teaching activities. Teaching is defined very broadly, including actively
                   interacting with pupils, correcting or grading pupil's work, asking questions, testing,
                   using the black board, or having pupils working on a specific task, drilling, or
                   memorization. Non-teaching activities is defined as work that is not related to
                   teaching, including working on private matters, maintaining discipline in class, or
                   doing nothing and thus leaving pupils not paying attention.
Minimum knowledge among teachers
Share of teachers      This indicator measures teacher's knowledge and is based on mathematics and
with minimum           language tests covering the primary curriculum administered at the school level to
knowledge              all mathematics or language teachers that taught grade three in the previous year or
                       grade four in the year the survey was conducted. It is calculated as the percentage of
                       teachers who score more than 80 percent on the language and mathematics portion
                       of the test. The indicator is representative of the average teacher in the universe of
                       teachers in a given country rather than the average teacher at the average school.

                        Test score: This indicator measures teacher’s knowledge and it is calculated as the
                        overall score of a mathematics, language, and pedagogy tests covering the primary
                        curriculum administered at the school level to all mathematics and language
                        teachers that taught grade three in the previous year or grade four in the year the
                        survey was conducted.
Infrastructure availability
Unweighted average     Minimum infrastructure resources is a binary variable capturing availability of: (i)
of the proportion of   functioning toilets operationalized as being clean, private, and accessible; and (ii)
schools with the       sufficient light to read the blackboard from the back of the classroom.
following available:
functioning            Functioning toilets: Whether the toilets were functioning was verified by the
electricity and        enumerators as being accessible, clean, and private (enclosed and with gender
sanitation             separation).

                                                    42
                     Electricity: Functional availability of electricity is assessed by checking whether the
                     light in the classroom works and gives minimum light quality. The enumerator
                     places a printout on the board and checks (assisted by a mobile light meter) whether
                     it was possible to read the printout from the back of the classroom.
Teaching Equipment availability
Unweighted average      Equipment availability is a binary variable equal to one if (i) the randomly selected
of the proportion of    grade four classroom has a functioning blackboard and chalk, (ii) the share of pupils
schools with the        with pens is equal to or above 90 percent, and (iii) the share of pupils with
following available:    notebooks in that classroom is equal to or above 90 percent.
functioning
blackboard with         Functioning blackboard and chalk: The enumerator assesses if there was a
chalk, pencils, and     functioning blackboard in the classroom, measured as whether a text written on the
notebooks               blackboard could be read at the front and back of the classroom, and whether there
                        was chalk available to write on the blackboard.

                        Pencils/pens and notebooks: The enumerator counts the number of pupils with
                        pencils or pens and notebooks, respectively. By dividing each count by the number of
                        pupils in the classroom, one can then estimate the share of pupils with pencils or
                        pens and the share of pupils with notebooks.
Share of pupils with textbooks
Number of               The indicator measures in one randomly selected grade four class the number of
mathematics and         pupils with the relevant textbooks (mathematic or language conditional on which
language books used     randomly selected class is observed), and divided by the number of pupils in the
in a grade four         classroom.
