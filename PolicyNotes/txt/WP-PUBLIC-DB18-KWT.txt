About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      power requirement
      Agency : Electrical engineer licensed by the Ministry of Electricity and Water
      (MEW)

      The client hires an engineering consulting rm that is approved by the union
      of engineers and that has a Supervision Engineer licensed by MEW. The
      consulting rm (i.e. contractor), will then study and estimate the electrical
      load and power requirement of the project so as to obtain MEW's
      approval/authorization for availability of electricity supply (see procedure
      below). The fees vary depending on the prices set by the contractor.

      estimate
      Agency : Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)

      The client submits an application to the Distribution department of MEW to
      get the approval/authorization of electricity supply. The client needs to
      submit:
      - The study and estimate done by the consulting rm in Procedure 1.
      - 3 copies to the concerned governorate engineer of the electrical
      distribution network (EDN) department requesting approval/authorization
      for the electricity supply
      - Copy of the application after necessary approval duly signed and stamped
      by the governorate engineer
      - Licenses of construction

      The request can be submitted online through the following
      link:https://portal.mew.gov.kw/


      However, all forms need to be submitted in person.

  3   Receive site inspection by Ministry of Electricity and Water                      1 calendar day     KWD 0
      Agency : Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)

      The client obtains a site inspection from the Ministry of Electricity and Water
      (MEW) and awaits the estimate of connection fees. After the inspection is
      done, MEW hands the client a stamped approval and authorization

  4   Obtain "no objection" letter from municipality                                    22 calendar days   KWD 0
      Agency : Municipality

      After completing the building works and obtaining the approval of the
      municipality, the applicant will need to apply for a no-objection letter from
      the municipality. The municipality will then send the letter by mail to the
      Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) so the latter can install the meter and
      turn on supply of electricity to the project.

      internal wiring
      Agency : Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)

      During or after execution of the internal wiring the client’s licensed engineer
      will need to submit the nal electrical drawings related to the internal wiring
      for approval to the Electrical Installation Department of the Ministry. These                                          Page 25

   5   Submit nal electrical drawings for approval and obtain inspection of              21 calendar days   KWD 0
       internal wiring
       Agency : Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)

       During or after execution of the internal wiring the client’s licensed engineer
       will need to submit the nal electrical drawings related to the internal wiring
       for approval to the Electrical Installation Department of the Ministry. These
       drawings include air-conditioning, lighting and all other electrical equipment,
       electrical mains, switches, cable sizes, circuit breakers and fuses. The client
       will also need to submit a load form in order to obtain inspection of internal
       wiring and nal connection. The load form will then be handed over to the
       applicant themselves. If the applicant is a company, the form will be handed
       over to an authorized sta of the company. The approval itself is granted
       after a couple of weeks, but is obtained in parallel with the external works.
       The inspection however, happens only after the Ministry of Electricity and
       Water (MEW) has obtained the letter of no-objection from the municipality. If
       the drawings meet the Ministry’s speci cations, then inspectors from the
       Electrical Installation Department of the Ministry will inspect the internal
       installation (size of cables, type of fuses, cable connection process and
       installation of main panels and sub-panels inside and outside the
       warehouse). The engineer also needs to submit approvals from the
       Municipality and the Kuwait Fire Department. The Municipality will also check
       that plans are actually corresponding to latest drawings.

   6   Obtain external works from Electrical Installation Department                     21 calendar days   KWD 6,189.95
       Agency : Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)

       Once the drawings are approved, the client needs to pay the fees of the
       project to Ministry of Electricity & Water (MEW) for the power supply
       connection. This cost is for the equipment supplied by the ministry. The
       payment is done at the estimation department of MEW. The estimation
       department then gives the green light to the Electrical Distribution Networks
       Department so that external works can be started.
       External works are designed and carried out by the Electrical Distribution
       Networks Department of MEW. A 140-kVA load can be supplied from an
       existing distribution sub-station in the area, if capacity is available.
       In the absence of the infrastructure facilities, the holder of the license can
       allocate a space on the plot not exceeding 5x5 m2 for the MEW to install an
       electrical transformer to provide additional power to the plot. Having the
       transformer installed will not result in additional cost to the customer.
       The former scenario is however, the more likely one for the assumed case.

   7   Obtain meter installation and nal turn-on of supply                               10 calendar days   KWD 140
       Agency : Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW)

       The client needs to show a receipt of payment to one of the nearest
       emergency departments of the Ministry of Electricity and Water to obtain
        nal supply. The meter is handed over to the client directly by the Consumer
       A airs Department, and the installation is carried out by the Electrical
       Installation Department.

       jurisdiction over the location of the warehouse to be sold) to submit an
       application for an allocation letter (specifying the size of the plot and the
       buildings on it if any) and a description certi cate (description of the existing
       buildings if any on the plot and size/use of such building). The fee to be paid
       for these documents is KD150 (for a commercial property). The seller
       concurrently delivers the warehouse's title deed to the Municipality against a
       receipt thereof. The engineer/architect responsible for the area then xes a
       date to meet with the seller at the warehouse to carry out the inspection, or
       may alternatively carry out the inspection on his own. Meanwhile, the seller
       should obtain clearance from the utility authorities (i.e. electricity, water and
       telephone). When the Municipality engineer completes the inspection
       (veri es the deed against the actual plot of land and stores report at the
       Municipality) and the Municipality has issued the descriptions certi cate and
       the allocation letter for the property, the seller will be issued with a receipt

       receive the original title deed, the allocation letter and the descriptions
       certi cate from the Real Estate Registry Division at the Ministry of Justice.

                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding          foreclosure       Security documents relating to collateral (Hotel) located in Kuwait would be enforced before

Outcome             piecemeal sale    The hotel will stop operating and Mirage assets will be sold piecemeal in a public auction
                                      upon the completion of the proceeding.

Time (in years)     4.2               The foreclosure procedure takes approximately 4.2 years until BizBank is repaid some or all
                                      of the money owed to it. The delay is largely due to the difficulty in scheduling a court
                                      hearing to resolve appeals from relevant parties to BizBank's foreclosure attempt, as well as
                                      the preparation and implementation of the auction. It takes at least half a year (probably 8
                                      months) for the Court to review BizBank's initial foreclosure request. If appeals arise from
                                      unsecured creditors , the Court will hold hearings and make the decision, which can take up
                                      to 3 years.

Cost (% of          10.0              The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 10% of the value of the
estate)                               debtor's estate. Cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court or
                                      government agency fees (1%), attorney fees (5%), fees of accountants, assessors, inspectors
                                      and other professionals (1%), and fees of auctioneers (1%-5%).
