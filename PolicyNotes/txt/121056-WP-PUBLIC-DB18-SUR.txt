About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of starting a business is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      design of the electrical installation (internal wiring) and customer
      information.

      Only a certi ed electrician can submit the application. The EBS sta reviews
      the information on the application and the design of the electrical
      installation. If the application is in accordance with the requirement of the
      EBS, the electrician can apply for inspection of the installation.

      10 days.

      Agency : N.V. Energiebedrijven Suriname (EBS)

      After the electrician has made the changes and called EBS to set an
      appointment, a representative of EBS comes to inspect the work site and to
      inspect the internal wiring of the warehouse. EBS serves di erent districts at
      di erent days of the week, so it may take one week before the inspection.
      The electrician should be present during the inspection. EBS provides a note
      of approval. However, it is not mandatory to be present. After the
      inspections, the customer receives a letter with the works explained and the
      cost. The customer pays the estimate and the deposit and the external
      works can start.

      Agency : N.V. Energiebedrijven Suriname (EBS)

      When the customer has paid the connection fee and deposit, the electrician
      calls EBS for the connection works. There is then usually a lead time before
      the connection works can commence.

      The utility needs to build high-voltage, low-voltage lines and transformer
      poles. A di erent department within EBS installs the meter after the external
      connection works.

      The excavation permit is obtained by the utility and the time needed is
      included in the procedure time.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                     Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest      registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                   In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit       only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                        several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the         - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                     and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                         economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                        - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                        - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                      equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)              - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                        commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                        - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                 - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                  - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                        movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                     (after an           converted into a liquidation proceeding. After the default on payment, Mirage would initiate

                     reorganization)     BizBank is subject to an automatic stay. Mirage’s management will draft a plan that foresees
                                         the continuation of Mirage’s operations as a going concern, where Mirage’s management will
                                         stay in control. However, it is very likely that this plan is not approved, and that the case will
                                         be converted into liquidation which will be conducted by a court-appointed trustee. It is
                                         unlikely that the business will be sold as a going concern considering the current market
                                         status quo in Suriname, instead a piecemeal sale of Mirage's assets will happen.

Outcome              piecemeal sale      The hotel will stop operating and Mirage assets will be sold piecemeal after the liquidation
                                         proceeding.

Time (in years)      5.0                 A reorganization procedure that is then converted into liquidation will approximately take 5
                                         years in total. After reviewing Mirage's case, the judge can place the company under
                                         reorganization procedure within a stipulated period of time, which tends to be for a one year
                                         period. In practice, it will take almost 2 years to prepare the creditors’ list, draft and vote on
                                         the plan, which would be rejected under our case study assumptions. The case will then be
                                         converted into liquidation, taking the formal conversion and the organization and execution
                                         of the sale 3 additional years (until the proceeds of the sale are finally distributed among
                                         creditors).

Cost (% of           30.0                The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 30% of the value of the
estate)                                  debtor's estate. Main components of the cost incurred during the entire insolvency process
                                         include court or government agency fees (1-5%), attorneys’ fees (15%), and auctioneer’s fees
                                         (4%-10%).
