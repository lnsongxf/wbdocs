About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      Construction and Urbanization
      Agency : Municipal Council of Maputo City – Department of Construction and
      Urbanization

      Before obtaining the building permit, BuildCo must also obtain the right to
      the use and enjoyment of the land from the Municipal Council of Maputo
      City. According to Article 19 of Law 19/97 of 1 October and Article 24/2 of
      Decree No. 66/98 of 8 December, an exploration plan must be obtained prior
      to requesting an approval for the right to the use and enjoyment of the land
      and it costs MZN 320. Obtaining the right to the use and enjoyment of the
      land from the Municipal Council of Maputo City is often a timely procedure
      which can sometimes take several months and costs MZN 750. However,
      these procedures are not recorded because the Doing Business case study
      assumptions state that BuildCo already owns the land that it intends to build
      the warehouse on.

      For the building permit, BuildCo must submit an application to the Municipal
      Council with the full detailed plan attached. The cost is MZN 10.00 per sq. m.


      BuildCo has the right to make a request of prior information to the authority
      responsible for issuing the building permit, in order to be informed about
      the planning instruments for the area, as well as the requirements to be met
      for the construction.


      The validity of the building permit and the renewal and extension cannot
      exceed 10 years (Article 27 of Decree No. 2/2004 of March 31).

      Agency : Municipal Council of Maputo City

      Inspections may occur during construction. According to the law, 2 - 3
      inspections should be carried out by the Municipal Council and by the Labor
      Inspectorate. However, in practice, these inspections rarely occur. When
      they are undertaken, these inspections are announced by the inspector, who
      informs BuildCo of the inspection date. Normally, an inspection is carried out
      when the concrete is poured. BuildCo must keep a construction book where
      all the important information about the construction is entered. The
      inspectors use this book to check the actual state of the construction, as well
      as its conformity with the submitted project.

  4   Receive inspection from Municipality - II                                             1 day                    no charge

  8   Request nal inspection for occupancy permit and certidão de                      1 day     MZN 9,104
      benfeitoria
      Agency : Municipal Council of Maputo City – Department of Construction and
      Urbanization

      BuildCo can request a nal inspection only when the construction is fully
      complete. The nal inspection must take place within 30 days of the request.
      Under the new initiative of streamlining the process of building control and
       ghting corruption the Municipality of Maputo requires the request for the
       nal inspection to be made at the main o ce of the Department of
      Construction and Urbanization. The rationale behind this step is that before,
      companies would request the nal inspection from their respective district
      o ce of the Department of Construction and Urbanization where they could
      possibly have already established personal ties. These ties might have been
      used to wield their favorable decision.


      According to Decree No. 2/2004 of March 31the cost associated to this
      procedure is 5 MZN per square meter for the certidao de benfeitorias and 2
      MZN per square meter for the occupancy permit. Therefore, the total cost is
      7*1300.6 = 9104.2 MZN.

      Agency : Municipal Council of Maputo City and other departments (Fire,
      Health, Water, etc.)

      The nal inspection is carried out by the Fire Department, the Health
      Department, the Water Department, and other relevant agencies. This
      inspection is coordinated by the Municipal Authority, and its cost is included
      in the fee for the occupancy permit.

      Agency : Municipal Council of Maputo City – Department of Construction and
      Urbanization

      Once the nal inspection is complete, BuildCo can request the Occupancy
      permit. And in order to do so, it is necessary to submit the certi cate of
      improvements, pay all relevant taxes, and attach the building permit. At the
      same time, the owner should obtain the certidao de benfeitorias, which is a
      certi cate of the works done on the land. This certi cate needs to be
      presented at the land registry for the rst registration.

       Finally, BuildCo. is ready to register the new warehouse. For that purpose, it
       is necessary to register the building for real property tax purposes. BuildCo
       must present the occupancy permit. So it cannot be simultaneous with the
       previous procedure. According to Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Ministerial
       Diploma N.º 19/98 of 4 March, the registration cost is MZN 200.00. However,
       other fees are added to this charge such as administrative costs (MZN 150)
       and the fee for a new certi cate (MZN 75) to issue the registration certi cate.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Real Estate Registry (Conservatória do Registo Predial)                     procedure 1)

      A Real Estate Registry certi cate is obtained at the Conservatória do Registo
      Predial. This certi cate provides information regarding all the owners of the
      property/ bene ciaries of the use and bene t right, and is valid for 90 days. If
      the owner does not have a copy of the current real property registration,
      then the DCU (Town Planning Directorate) reference number must be
      obtained in order for the Registrar to locate the book and page on which the
      property is registered. As of 2013, the registry has been computerized and
      titles have been scanned.

      A lawyer prepares the sale and purchase agreement. It is necessary to have
      the underlying land and property title, and real property registration in
      order to have the description of the property, the land plot, and the
      demarcation details. The form of the description varies from rural areas to
      municipalities. The actual sales instrument is relatively simple but the
      additional administrative/registry detail complicates the preparation.
      Although not required by law, most companies and individuals hire the
      services of a lawyer to prepare the sale and purchase agreement.

  4   Payment of transfer tax (SISA) at the Municipal Tax O         ce                     7 days                   2% of property value
      Agency : Municipal Tax O ce (Secretaria Municipal de Fazenda)                                                 (SISA-transfer tax)

      The property must have been registered for real property taxes (municipal
      and national). All of the real property tax must have been paid (for which a
      tax clearance must be obtained), and the owner and the purchaser must be
      registered for tax purposes (NUIT). A SISA tax receipt is obtained and has to
      be submitted with the sale and purchase agreement to the notary. Then, the
      name of the buyer is registered with the Tax O ce. The SISA tax has been
      reformed by Decree 46/2004 of October 27, cutting it from previous levels
      around 10%. In the past, the 10% tax that applied to Maputo was not fully
      paid since the market value of the property was never quoted. This change
      uni es the level of the transfer tax with the rest of the country that already
      had taxes around 2%.

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
