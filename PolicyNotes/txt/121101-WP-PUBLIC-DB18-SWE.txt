About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Any employer or a company subject to VAT and intending to do business in
      Sweden must register with the Swedish Tax Agency. The registration is a
      prerequisite for a company to deduct VAT and to receive payment for
      services without deducting preliminary tax (F-tax registration). An employer
      must withhold social security tax for employee salary and account for such
      charges in the monthly returns. F-tax registration is a prerequisite to require
      payment for services rendered without the customer having to withhold
      preliminary income tax.


      Barring any unusual circumstance, companies should register with the
      Swedish Tax Agency 2 weeks before starting business activities. All

submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : Private Company

      BuildCo must hire a licensed private company to conduct construction
      supervision, including conducting any necessary inspections. The supervisor
      cannot be an employee of BuildCo. At the end of the construction, the
      supervisor must provide a "supervisor's report".

      Municipality
      Agency : Building Committee of the Municipality

      Under the Building Act, before the building permit is issued, a technical
      consultation meeting is held with the attendance of municipality o cials,
      BuildCo and an external certi ed supervisor. During the meeting, they will
      discuss documents such as the inspection plan, which will be later
      implemented during and after construction. After the meeting, the
      Municipality will issue the building permit to BuildCo.

  3   Obtain building permit                                                               60 days             SEK 88,680
      Agency : Municipality

      The building permit may be granted by the Building Committee, if considered
      appropriate and in accordance with the Municipal Comprehensive Plan. If
      the application is refused, the applicant does not receive compensation.

      The only way to secure an almost automatic right to a building permit is via
      the Detailed Development Plan (DDP). Formally, the planning initiative and
      responsibility lie in the hands of the Municipality, though in practice much of
      the initiative and work to take a plan forward may come from the private
      developer. When a DDP is adopted, the land owner can get approval of the
      building permit application if the building is in accordance with the plan
      regulations and if the construction satis es the requirements. If the
      application is refused, the applicant has a right to compensation for losses,
      provided that the application is led within the prescribed time of the DDP.

  4   Receive decision to commence construction                                            5 days              no charge
      Agency : Building Committee of the Municipality

      BuildCo must attend a meeting with the Building Committee prior to starting
      construction. The associated cost is included in the building permit
      application fee.

  5   Receive inspection from the Building Committee                                       1 day               no charge
      Agency : Planning Department

      Once construction has started, the Building Committee will conduct a site
      visit to verify that the construction is not deviating from the approved
      building plans. No further inspection will take place since there is an external
      supervising engineer. This is in accordance to Section 27 of the Building
      Regulations.

  6   Submit supervisor's report and hold nal consultation meeting                         10 days             no charge
      Agency : Building Committee of the Municipality

      There will be a nal consultation meeting with BuildCo, the authority and the                                            Page 14

  6   Submit supervisor's report and hold nal consultation meeting                          10 days                  no charge
      Agency : Building Committee of the Municipality

      There will be a nal consultation meeting with BuildCo, the authority and the
      supervisor. The supervisor must submit a supervisor's report, stating the
      building has been built in compliance with the regulations. According to
      Section 32 of the Building Regulations, the nal consultation will normally be
      held at the location of the construction site. The committee will then discuss
      if the building is in compliance with the approved plans and will issue the
       nal certi cate.

  7   Obtain water and sewerage connection                                                  25 days                  SEK 190,000
      Agency : Stockholm Water Company

      The time and cost for water and sewerage connection depend, to some
      extent, on the distance from the excavation works.

  8   Obtain nal certi cate                                                                 10 days                  no charge
      Agency : Building Committee of the Municipality

      At the end of the project, the Building Committee issues a nal certi cate if
      all requirements have been met. The building permit does not concern the
      technical requirements for the building. It is BuildCo's responsibility to
      ensure and to certify in writing that the building meets mandatory
      provisions to the Committee.

  2   Obtain external works from Vattenfall                                                28 calendar days    SEK 0
      Agency : Vattenfall Distribution, Stockholm

      The external connection works are carried out by Vattenfall, who provides
      the materials, performs all tasks and applies for all permits regarding the
      connection up until the connection point. Inside the land plot however, the
      client and his/her electrician have to dig a trench for the electrical cable and
      place approved the protective pipes in the trench.

      Once the external connection works are completed, the electrician/customer
      submits a certi cate (färdiganmälan), a document in which he/she
      guarantees that the internal wiring installation is done according to the
      standards. Normally no internal wiring inspection is carried out before the
      quali ed electrician submits his/her färdiganmälan. The contractor can,
      however, hire an outside agency to carry out such an inspection if he/she
      prefers.


      The meter is installed once the external works are done and the
      electrician/customer has submitted the färdiganmälan.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                      Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if

                                                          Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of enforcing contracts is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
enforcing contracts. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the component indicators.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
