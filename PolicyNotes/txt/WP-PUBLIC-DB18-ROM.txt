About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Pursuant to Order No. 839/2009 issued by the Ministry of Regional
      Development and Housing (“Order 839”), approving the Methodological
      Norms to the Construction Law, the following urban planning documents are
      required:
      • The general urban plan (PUG) and the related local regulation
      • The (zone) urban plan (PUZ) and the related local regulation
      • The detailed urban plan (PUD)


      The urban planning certi cate provides information on the ownership, the
      public utility service availability, the location within (intravilan) and outside
      (extravilan) the city limits, the urban planning requirements, the land use at
      the time, the allowed uses, and so forth.


      From a technical point of view, the certi cate shows the percentage of land
      occupation, the coe cient of land use, the minimum and maximum
      dimensions of the plots, the allowed built-up area, utilities, and access,
      necessary parking, alignment of the land and buildings with the adjacent
      streets, and the maximum and minimum construction height allowed.


      This certi cate does not grant the right to build. Its validity period varies but
      cannot exceed 12 months. Construction must start during that 12-month
      period.


      The urban planning certi cate enumerates all the necessary project
      clearances applicable to the warehouse case considered here. The
      municipality has the right to decide which project clearances are needed.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding           liquidation       According to the Romanian Insolvency Code (Law no. 85/2014), the procedure will start with
                     (after an         an observation period, followed by reorganization and, if the reorganization fails, it will be

                                       of insolvency. At first, Mirage might propose a reorganization plan in order to benefit from
                                       the moratorium of all ongoing judicial proceedings involving its creditors and to renegotiate

                                       liquidation. Given this context, according to Article 143 para. (1) of the Insolvency Code, if the
                                       debtor fails to comply with the reorganization plan or its activity brings losses, the judicial
                                       receiver or any of the creditors may request the syndic judge to approve the
                                       commencement of the bankruptcy and liquidation procedure against the debtor.

Outcome              piecemeal sale    The hotel will continue its current activity only during the observation period (art. 87 of Law
                                       85/2014) and in the reorganization procedure according to the reorganization plan (art 141
                                       (1) of Law 85/2014). If Mirage enters the bankruptcy/liquidation procedure, then the hotel will
                                       stop operating, as it is unlikely that a buyer can be found willing to purchase the hotel as a
                                       going concern and continue operating it.

Time (in years)      3.3               Insolvency proceedings last on average 3-5 years due to a large number of cases filed and
                                       delaying tactics used by the debtors to avoid liquidation of the company. Most statutory
                                       deadlines cannot be complied with in practice. The main procedural steps for the
                                       completion of the insolvency process for Mirage are: (i) the observation period (as of the
                                       opening of the insolvency proceedings and until the reorganization plan is approved or the
                                       bankruptcy proceedings are initiated) may take a maximum of 12 months (art. 112(3) of the
                                       Insolvency Code); (ii) reorganization may take 4 years after the confirmation of the plan, but
                                       this period may be extended (art. 139(5), Insolvency Code). After one year to one year and a
                                       half, the course of proceedings becomes apparent: either successful completion of
                                       reorganization (in very few cases), or the bankruptcy proceedings are initiated, (iii)
                                       liquidation may take 9 months to 2.5 years, depending on the nature and quantity of the
                                       debtor’s assets to be capitalized on.

Cost (% of           10.5              The cost of proceedings will amount to approximately 10.5%. The major expenses will include
estate)                                fees of the insolvency representative (around 8%) and attorneys' fees (around 2%). Other
                                       expenses are minimal.
