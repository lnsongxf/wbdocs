Preface
The objective of this joint case study is to review the experience of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the
World Bank in supporting Sri Lanka as it moves toward its goals for sustainable and
equitable provision of water and sanitation services to its people. The case study
examines the collective experience of the three institutions during the 10-year period
2007–16, and alignment with the country’s sector and larger economic goals.

This case study was prepared by a team of staff and consultants from ADB’s
Independent Evaluation Department (IED), the Evaluation Department of JICA, and the
Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank Group. This joint review is believed
to be the first collaborative effort of this kind in any sector for the three institutions.

The team undertook a joint mission to Sri Lanka from August 22 to September 3, 2016
and met with officials of central government departments and agencies and provincial
and local governments that are involved in or work with water supply and sanitation
functions.

In addition to beneficiary interviews in 10 locations in six districts, the team also
conducted focus group discussions in seven locations in two districts of Sri Lanka to
obtain feedback from a range of beneficiaries and leaders of community-based
organizations. A detailed report on the findings from the focus group discussions was
prepared to accompany this document.

JICA hosted a workshop on September 2, 2016 on behalf of the joint mission that
brought together officials of concerned government departments in the central
government and officials representing other development partners to discuss the issues
this joint case study raised. A separate document summarizes the proceedings. IED and
JICA also prepared another sector background report that examines sector experience
and coordination among donors and development partners.

1. National Economic Goals and Water Supply
and Sanitation
Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country of 21 million people. Less than 7 percent of
the population is below the poverty line, and Sri Lanka occupies a strategic position in
Asia, the fastest-growing region in the world. The country has experienced average
annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.25 percent since 2005, and the
government is now targeting an annual growth rate of more than 7 percent in the next
10 years (CBSL 2010, 2015; MOF 2016).

Sri Lanka is well-positioned to meet its ambitious goals for economic growth. On the
macroeconomic front, efforts are under way to strengthen fiscal policy, bolster public
financial management, reform state enterprises, and improve competitiveness. The
country has a strong base of human capital and reliable infrastructure. Ports and other
transport-related facilities have benefited from increased investment in the past decade.
Access to electricity and to improved water and sanitation are significantly better than
in neighboring South Asian countries and compare favorably with those of Malaysia
and Thailand, both upper-middle-income countries in East Asia (IMF 2016) (figure 1.1).

Note: Per the World Development Indicators (WDI) reports, an improved drinking water source is one that is protected from
outside contamination, particularly from fecal matter contamination, by nature of its construction or through active intervention
(for example, borewells and piped water versus surface drinking water sources). An improved sanitation facility is one that
hygienically separates human excreta from human contact (for example, a pit latrine with slab, flush/pour flush to sewer
system versus open defecation or shared sanitation facilities).


However, regarding improved water supply and sanitation (WSS), Sri Lanka’s
favorable access levels also come with serious gaps and shortcomings in responding to

beneficiaries’ needs for better quality across urban, rural, and estate areas. Piped water
is available to only 48 percent of the total population. In the Northern Province, piped
water is available to only 11 percent of the population, contrasting sharply with
65 percent in the Western Province. Off-site sewerage is available in only a few urban
areas in the country and does not adequately cover the population in each location.
Reliability and quality of the water supply vary widely in rural and estate areas.

The capacity of the existing infrastructure to provide service delivery that is acceptable
to consumers is falling behind the rising demand and expectations from increasing
urbanization and growth in incomes. In particular, scant treatment of wastewater,
limited sewerage, and poor on-site sanitation are having an increasing impact on the
quality of surface water and groundwater, affecting living conditions in urban and peri-
urban areas and the quality of drinking water. Off-site sewerage is available in only a
few urban areas in the country and is inadequate to cover the entire population of each
location (table 1.1). Dependence on on-site sanitation has generated fecal sludge, which,
when combined with solid wastes, clogs water bodies near settlements and stormwater
drains in and around larger cities. Inadequate arrangements for collecting and
segregating solid waste, especially in low-income communities, affects both water
quality and sedimentation levels in stormwater drains, rivers, and lakes, adding to
environmental impacts on water bodies and land that are difficult to reverse. Industrial

Domestic water needs are increasingly in competition with the demands of the
agricultural, industrial, and services sectors. Although it fares well compared with
countries in South Asia, Sri Lanka is behind comparable countries in East Asia on
several components of a National Water Security Index, which covers household,
urban, economic, environmental, and disaster resilience aspects. 1 In Colombo, this is
seen in how the WSS infrastructure’s shortcomings are contributing to the diminishing
capacity of the network of rivers, drains, lakes, and ponds to adequately buffer the
excess flows of rainwater during the two monsoon seasons that the city experiences
every year. Consequently, the engineered hydraulic infrastructure and the natural
water (wetland) ecosystem are highly stressed, posing a threat to both the city and
country’s plans for rapid economic growth (table 1.2).

Water tariffs in Sri Lanka are some of the lowest in the world, barely covering operating
costs, and leaving little room for contributing to rehabilitation. Given the large needs for

NATIONAL ECONOMIC GOALS AND WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION
infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion of services, the lack of financial
sustainability implied by the low tariffs further undermines the scale and sustainability
of service delivery (figure 1.3).

Sri Lanka’s development objectives regarding water resources are contained in two key
documents: Mahinda Chintana—Vision for the Future: The Development Policy Framework,
Government of Sri Lanka (DNP 2010), and Mahinda Chintana: A Vision for a New Sri
Lanka—A Ten-Year Horizon Development Framework 2006—2016 (DNP 2006). Both
publications recognize that urbanization will increase the demand for drinking water,
and improved access to safe and reliable drinking water is needed for urban and rural
areas throughout the country.

Sri Lanka’s ambitious goals for economic growth and joining the community of upper-
middle-income countries call for setting high standards for the WSS sector. The
appropriate objective for the country should be to go beyond the Sustainable
Development Goals (achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable
drinking water; and adequate and equitable sanitation and an end to open defecation,
both by 2030). 2 The objective should move toward physically, financially, and
environmentally sustainable service delivery in the WSS sector that responds to
consumers’ increasing expectations and the needs of a growing economy.

the WSS sector’s shortcomings and uneven development do not become a drag on the
larger national goals for economic growth, and on reducing extreme poverty and
improving shared prosperity.


1 The National Water Security Index is based on five key dimensions for household, economic,
urban, environmental, and resilience to water-related disasters. The overall national water
security of each country is assessed as the composite result of the five key dimensions measured
on a scale of 1–20, with 1 being a low level of water security and 20 being the exemplary level.

2. Review of the Joint Portfolio for Water Supply
and Sanitation, 2007–16
ADB, JICA, and the World Bank give WSS high priority in their lending portfolios for
all client countries. During 2007–16, ADB, JICA, and the World Bank committed about
$12.5 billion, $12 billion, and $38 billion, respectively, for WSS in their client countries,
which amounted to about 25 percent, 14 percent, and 7 percent, respectively, of their
overall lending. For ADB in particular, water became a core area of operation with the
establishment of its Water Financing Program in 2006.


Distribution, Scale, and Objectives of Joint Projects in Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, the three development partners have played a prominent role in the WSS
sector. During the 10-year period 2007–16, the quantum of assistance committed to the
sector by these three institutions totals $1,970.3 million, which supported total project
costs of $3,388.1 million. This compares to an average total annual investment in WSS in
the country of about $200 million during the period 2007–11, indicating the high share
of investment contributed by the three development partners in the sector (World Bank
2014). ADB’s net support to WSS since 2007 is $910.8 million, JICA’s is $636.4 million,
and the World Bank’s is $423.1 million (table 2.1).

The three development partners completed or began the implementation of 39 projects
during 2007–16 that either are dedicated to WSS (27) or have a significant component

ADB had three loans (investment projects) and five technical assistance projects
dedicated to the sector that were closed during 2007–16 (including one that was closed
in mid-2017). The two investment projects commenced in the late 1990s and targeted
rehabilitation of existing water supply programs, and new construction for villages and
small and medium-size secondary towns (population ranging between 6,000 and
30,000). Closed technical assistance projects have focused on capacity building for
reducing non-revenue water (NRW) and wastewater management in Colombo, and on
regulatory reform and strengthening decentralization in the water sector. The five
ongoing investment projects also focus on large towns and cities, and they concentrate
on improving WSS services in dry-zone towns and rural water supply programs, and in
the Greater Colombo area. The projects in conflict-affected areas around Jaffna and
Kilinochchi have just been closed. In recent years, water supply projects have come to
have greater importance in providing improved access to safe drinking water,
particularly in areas affected by CKDu, which is a government priority. Two of ADB’s
recent technical assistance projects are focusing on institutional development of the
National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and wastewater management
improvement in Colombo.

JICA had five loan projects and two technical assistance engagements dedicated to WSS
that were completed during 2007–16, and three loan projects and two technical

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF THE JOINT PORTFOLIO FOR WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION, 2007–16
assistance engagements are ongoing. Collectively, these projects address a variety of
sector issues. These include expanding the existing water supply facilities in urban
areas and introducing new pipe-borne water supply facilities, including community-
based, small-scale facilities in rural areas; reducing NRW by replacing and repairing
aged water pipes in urban areas and providing related technical cooperation; and
improving sewerage by implementing high-priority projects, and analyzing the current
status and challenges through technical assistance for the preparation of a strategic
master plan. Under its loan projects, JICA’s emphasis is on providing quality
infrastructure investments.

In addition to these three areas, JICA implements several other programs, such as
public-private partnerships that technologies of small and medium-size Japanese
enterprises that meet local needs and conditions, such as measures to reduce NRW,
prestressed concrete tanks, and ozone treatment of industrial water. JICA also provides
a form of technical cooperation under its Japan-based Sector Technical Training
Program, now called the Knowledge Co-Creation Program, which is geared to
improving the problem-solving skills of program participants, thus adding a crucial
element in human resource development that complements other assistance. Many of
Sri Lanka’s WSS sector officials from both the national and local governments have
taken part in this program since the mid-1950s, and feedback obtained from some of
these officials confirms the program’s value added for sector-related work.

The World Bank’s projects tend to have a multisector orientation, and in the period
under consideration, only one dedicated sector project (focusing on rural WSS) has been
completed, and another dedicated project—also focusing on rural WSS—is ongoing.
The Second Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which was completed in
2011, is a continuation of the groundbreaking Community Water Supply and Sanitation
Project implemented in the 1990s that pioneered devolving management of RWS
programs to CBOs. Building on the achievements of the first project, the Second
Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project aimed to increase service coverage
and achieve effective and sustained use of WSS services in rural communities in Sri
Lanka. The ongoing Water and Sanitation Improvement Project aims to increase access
to piped water services and improved sanitation in seven selected districts and
strengthen the capacity of associated institutions. In the past, the World Bank has also
provided significant non-lending or technical assistance support for infrastructure
assessments, public-private partnership frameworks, and urban policy covering WSS,
among other sectors.

Relative Emphasis of the ADB, JICA, and the World Bank on Sector Issues and
Geographic Areas
During the past decade, there have been consistent patterns in the efforts of the
development partners regarding issues and geographic coverage. ADB’s Sri Lanka
country partnership strategies (ADB 2003, 2010, 2011) during the past 10 years aimed to
assist the government in providing safe water for all, improving sanitation, supporting
lagging and conflict areas, and promoting rational policy development. JICA Country
Analytical Work (JICA 2012) has focused on three issues: expanding water supply
improvement in urban areas and establishing new water supply systems in rural areas;
contributing to reduction of NRW and improving the management efficiency of
NWSDB; and identifying priority sanitation improvement projects through the Project
for the Strategic Master Plan under Sewerage Sector, a technical assistance project. For
the World Bank, WSS has consistently been one of the key priorities in its country
strategies in the past decade, with emphasis on providing water supply to rural areas
and the postconflict North and Eastern regions. Although all three of the development
partners emphasize their role in expanding access to WSS services, including lagging
and postconflict areas, JICA has placed more emphasis on reducing NRW, improving
urban sanitation, and water resources management, while ADB has placed relatively
more emphasis on institutional reforms and WSS improvements for secondary towns.

There are some noteworthy patterns in the urban, rural, and geographic deployment of
the development partners’ projects. Although the World Bank’s activities are mostly in
rural areas and lagging regions in Central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva Provinces, JICA
and ADB are more oriented toward interventions in urban areas. However, JICA
focuses more on large cities such as Colombo and Kandy, unlike ADB, which focuses
more on secondary towns such as Muttur. JICA and ADB also have projects in
Colombo, but they have a different focus. JICA has been concentrating on the Kalu
River in the southern part of Colombo as an alternative water resource to the Kelani
River. In the project formulation stage in 1997, JICA strategically identified this area to
prevent water scarcity in Colombo caused by its rapid economic growth and
urbanization. ADB’s projects in Colombo have focused on improving water supply
services and wastewater management in the city. All three of the development partners
are involved in projects being implemented in areas in the north and east that were
previously conflict-affected, notably in Trincomalee and Kilinochchi Districts, and in
Batticaloa and Ampara in the Eastern Province. Together, the development partners
have worked or are working on sector activities in 23 districts of Sri Lanka since 2007,
excluding only Gampaha in the Western Province and Galle in the Southern Province
(figure 2.1).

Overall, each development partner has worked on distinctive issues of focus within
common sector goals, but coordination of efforts has been good. The development
partners’ activities have had no overlapping locations or beneficiaries. Most of the
districts throughout the country have been covered with assistance of at least one of the
three development partners. Where more than one development partner works in a
single geographic area, division of assistance by either subareas or subsectors between
them has avoided overlap and resulted in synergistic effects for the area as a whole. For
example, both ADB and JICA have provided loans, in parallel, to increase water supply
coverage throughout the Greater Colombo area. Additionally, JICA has worked on
reducing NRW and on water quality monitoring while ADB has worked on
rehabilitation of the networks. Together, the two development partners’ approach has
contributed to the improvement of water supply services in Greater Colombo and has
strengthened the capacity of NWSDB. Similarly, the three development partners had a
coordinated approach in RWS assistance—the CBO program approach that the World
Bank originally designed has evolved with ADB’s rural community-based water supply
programs, and JICA also adopted it for its RWS projects. A water and sanitation sector
donor-coordination working group aided this coordination. Agence Française de
Développement (AFD), the French overseas development assistance agency, initiated the
working group, and it was affiliated with the Development Partners Forum coordinated
by the World Bank Sri Lanka office. 1


Assessing ADB, JICA, and World Bank Contributions to WSS in Sri Lanka
Each development partner rates the performance of its projects using its own rating
scale, and the scales are not strictly comparable. 2 ADB rated the Third Water Supply
Project and the Local Government Infrastructure Improvement Project as successful,
and the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation
project as less than successful. Of the five closed technical assistance projects, three of
them supporting the Capacity Development for Wastewater Management Services in
Colombo, Capacity Development for Non-Revenue Water Reduction, and Wastewater
Management Improvement in Colombo Municipal Council project were rated
successful, and two technical assistance projects related to supporting a regulatory
framework for WSS and supporting decentralization in the sector were rated less than
successful. For JICA, four loans are not yet rated; the Lunawa Environment
Improvement and Community Development Project was rated satisfactory. Similarly, of
the two closed technical assistance projects, the Capacity Development Project for NRW
Reduction in Colombo City was rated as having achieved its objectives and attained the
desired outcome. For the World Bank, of five rated projects, four were rated moderately
satisfactory, and one was rated unsatisfactory. The Second Community Water Supply

and Sanitation Project, which is the only closed project dedicated to WSS, was rated
moderately satisfactory.

This case study attempted to map the key performance indicators used by each
development partner to a common set of key performance indicators. However, varying
definitions for similar parameters between development partners made it difficult to
carry out this exercise. In the future, development partners should work with the
government to develop consistent definitions for different parameters to enable better
tracking of the Sustainable Development Goals indicators.

  The Development Partners Forum is an informal, broad, and inclusive mechanism for
information and experience-sharing within the foreign aid community in Sri Lanka. It provides
an opportunity for development partners to identify and discuss topics of common interest and
areas that may require further dialogue with government authorities. The Development Partner
Forum allows missions to brief one another on their aid strategies and programs, and discuss
new initiatives. The World Bank Group’s Colombo office is the development partner Secretariat,
supported with a dedicated Development Partner Coordinator position.

  The ADB uses a four-point scale: highly successful, successful, less than successful, and
unsuccessful. JICA uses a four-point scale: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, partially satisfactory,
and unsatisfactory. The World Bank uses a six-point scale: highly satisfactory, satisfactory,
moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.

3. Trends and Issues in Urban and Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Service Delivery
Eighteen percent of the population of Sri Lanka is urban and 82 percent is rural. 1 The
rural population includes the estate sector, which comprises 5 percent of the national
population. Access to RWS and sanitation in Sri Lanka has grown significantly in the
survey years between 2000 and 2015, from 77 percent and 80 percent in 2000 to
95 percent and 97 percent, in 2015. However, it appears to have leveled off since then,
pointing to the challenges of bridging the last mile. The growth in access to rural WSS
has been particularly impressive and has mostly driven the overall national trend for
sanitation. Urban sanitation lags in relative terms, having grown only marginally from
85 percent to 88 percent during the 2000–15 period. Urban water supply started from a
high base of 95 percent in 2000 and had reached 98 percent by 2015 (figure 3.1).

Overall access to WSS is impressive, but there are large gaps and shortcomings in
service delivery parameters—adequacy, reliability, and quality—for WSS, in urban and
rural areas. Service providers in all categories face challenges in operational efficiency,
financial sustainability, technical and managerial capacity, and institutional clarity. The
following sections discuss these challenges, in order, for urban water supply, RWS,
urban sanitation, and rural sanitation, followed by the estate sector and its unique
issues.

TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY

Urban Water Supply
Service Delivery Mode and Institutions: The NWSDB is responsible for water supply
services to urban areas in Sri Lanka, except for areas where municipal or urban councils
provide the water supply (Kandy, Kurunegala, Nuwara Eliya, and Jaffna). The NWSDB,
which was originally a subdepartment under the Public Works Department, was
operated as a highly centralized organization until 1992, when regional support centers
(RSC) were established with the help of an institutional development program funded
by the U.S. Agency for International Development. 2 Currently, NWSDB operates
through 11 RSCs, each headed by a deputy general manager who reports to another
general manager at the head office in Colombo.

Although many functions—including design—are now decentralized to RSCs (a move
supported by the ADB-funded Institutional Strengthening for Decentralized Service
Delivery in the Water Sector technical assistance project), some key functions, such as
finance, human resource management, and procurement, are still managed centrally.
RSCs are well positioned to coordinate with local authorities, such as provincial
councils, to improve water supply services in the regions. Furthermore, decentralization
is desirable to enable RSCs to respond more effectively and promptly to local needs and
to coordinate with other relevant agencies, such as the office of the Medical Officers of
Health, at the local level.

Access: Access to safe water in 2012–13 in urban areas was 98.8 percent, having
overcome the impact of about 10 percent 2006–7 (table 3.1). 3 More than 92 percent of the
urban population is reported to have access to drinking water within their premises.
Urban water supply is provided through 331 urban water supply programs that
provide more than 1.9 million connections (NWSDB 2016b) covering about 7.4 million
people. 4 Although many small towns that are outside the official definition of urban
areas are already covered by these water supply programs, some areas in the previously
conflict-affected areas to the north and east are in the process of getting piped water.

Adequacy and Reliability: About 98 percent of the urban population is estimated to
have sufficient water for drinking, bathing, and washing. About 40 percent of the urban
water supply programs provide 18–20 hours of continuous supply (table 3.2). Most
households have adapted to these hours by constructing water storage tanks on their
premises, though poorer households may not have sufficient space for storage tanks.
The low pressure in pipes from discontinuity in the water supply may be causing
contamination of water within the distribution network. Overall, demand for water is
increasing due to changing lifestyles and greater appliance use made possible by
increasing incomes (table 3.2).

Operational Performance: Overall, the NWSDB, as the sole lead sector agency with
national responsibilities for water supply development, has achieved strong results in
expanding coverage and access to improved water supply. The NWSDB’s service
performance has improved during the past decade (table 3.2). The agency has reduced
islandwide NRW from 34 percent in 2006 to 26 percent by 2016, but NRW in Colombo
still stands at 46 percent. The reasons for the high level of NRW include inaccessible
breaks (under concrete roads, for example); poor quality of equipment such as pipes,
pumps, and fittings; and lack of an adequate metering system. Technical capacity,
particularly within the plumbing industry, is inadequate to recognize leaks and provide
long-term solutions. The age of the distribution network is clearly a major factor,
particularly in Colombo, where some pipes are more than 100 years old. To bring NRW

Water Quality: The quality of water supplied by the NWSDB is perceived to be safe to
drink without any further purification by the household. This is consistent with the
feedback received from beneficiaries during focus group discussions held for this case
study in Allainagar and Jayanagar in Muttur. However, according to the Ministry of
Health, objective measurements show that only 77 percent of samples that the Ministry
of Health collected for bacteriological testing from the NWSDB’s distribution network
were found to be satisfactory, compared with 99.5 percent of samples collected and
tested by the NWSDB on its own. This difference warrants further analysis.

              TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY
Financial Sustainability: NWSDB posted a profit from operating activities in six of the
past 10 years, but its financial sustainability may be threatened because of its growing
debt and debt service requirements (table 3.3). The NWSDB’s current tariff model
strives for financial sustainability at the national level through cross-subsidization; at
present, all NWSDB systems in all of the provinces have the same tariff program. Water
tariffs in Sri Lanka are relatively low compared with those in other countries
(figure 1.3), and the actual cost of water supply services is not known precisely. By
some estimates, if capital investment cost, operation and maintenance cost, replacement
cost, environmental cost, and opportunity cost are all included, only about one-third of
the total cost of water supply is recovered from consumers (CCI 2016). Although water
tariffs were increased in 2009 and again in 2012, they are still too low for cost recovery
beyond operation and maintenance costs. 6 Public opinion is likely to be against tariff
increases and will need to be managed through a program to raise consumer awareness,
foster stakeholder engagement, and provide education. Focus group discussions carried
out for this case study with urban users in Kandy and Trincomalee suggest that urban
consumers have little knowledge of the costs of supplying clean drinking water, and
although some users recognize the need to pay more for water supply services, others
are strongly opposed to tariff increases. A cabinet decision in May 2017 approved the
introduction of external regulation for the water services industry through the
appointment of the Public Utilities Commission as independent regulator. The enabling
legislation and guidelines for implementing the regulation are currently being
developed for formal implementation in 2018. During the past decade, the development
partners have provided loans, grants, and technical assistance for improving urban
water supply services. Together, they have contributed or will contribute to providing
improved water supply services to more than 1.5 million urban households. For
example, JICA’s Water Sector Development (II) loan aims to provide 490,600 people
with 48,000 cubic meters per day of supply in the Greater Colombo area. Additionally,
projects supported by the development partners have helped to rehabilitate or replace
more than 350 kilometers of pipes within the urban water supply network, and
currently active projects are expected to add more benefits. For example, ADB’s Greater
Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Program aims
to rehabilitate and replace about 318 kilometers of seriously degraded distribution
network pipes. As part of the World Bank–supported Sri Lanka Strategic Cities
Development Project, 650,000 urban residents are expected to benefit from improved
basic services, including water supply.

The technical assistance operations supporting the urban water subsector have achieved
mixed results. JICA’s Capacity Development Project for Non-Revenue Water Reduction
in Colombo City Project, implemented from 2009 to 2012, is reported to have resulted in
a remarkable NRW reduction in the pilot sites. The technical assistance provided

training on methods and techniques and assistance for preparation of the NRW
reduction work plan; and NRW reduction activities, such as meter installation, meter
replacement, leak detection and repair, and detection and elimination of illegal
connection. The actual decrement of NRW rate per year in Colombo Metropolitan City
area during 2012–15 was 1.2 percentage points per year, to which the project is
considered to have made a substantial contribution. Similar assistance for reducing
NRW was also provided in the Kandy Municipal area.

By contrast, technical assistance focused on sector reforms had limited success. The
World Bank’s economic reform technical assistance to support reforms and promote
private sector participation in urban water supply was either reversed or not
implemented. The ADB-supported technical assistance for two projects—Strengthening
the Regulatory Framework for Water Supply and Sanitation, and Institutional
Strengthening for Decentralized Service Delivery in the Water Sector—were also not
completely successful. The first achieved some amendments to the NWSDB Act, but the
outcome of developing an adequate legal and regulatory framework for water services
was not achieved by the time of their evaluation because the Water Services Reform Bill
had not been approved by parliament. The second technical assistance supported a
significant level of decentralization within the NWSDB, but not to the extent
envisioned, particularly in relation to financial and human resource aspects. However,
the recent cabinet decision to appoint the Public Utilities Commission as independent
regulator for water services, and plans to further decentralize planning and financial
functions to RSCs may be partially attributed to the technical assistance groundwork.

Interventions in urban water supply supported by the three development partners have
generated benefits at the household level. Focus group interviews with beneficiaries of
ADB’s Second Towns Project in Muttur noted the improvement in the quality of water
available to them, and the beneficiaries of JICA’s Water Sector Development Project in
Kandy noted the improvement in proximity and convenience after obtaining house
connections to the NWSDB network. In addition, beneficiary interviews conducted in
the Greater Colombo area for JICA’s Water Sector Development Project II suggest that
sanitary conditions have improved—beneficiaries have frequent showers and safe
water available for drinking and cooking; life quality has improved because of the time
saved from water fetching; and family expenditure is saved on electricity previously
required for dug-well operation. The results of the beneficiary interviews also suggest
some positive impacts on local economic activities. These include increased
productivity because of the reduction of cost and time necessary for water access, and
improved health conditions of workers. Local businesses in the service sector, especially
restaurants and hotels, reported an increase in the number of customers and customer
satisfaction.

Service Delivery Modes and Institutions: CBOs are the mainstay of RWS. Introduced
through a pilot program in the 1990s as part of the World Bank–funded Community
Water Supply and Sanitation Project, CBO programs have grown in popularity, and
several development partners, including ADB and JICA, have funded projects to
establish CBO-based RWS programs. At present, an estimated 4,500 such programs are
currently in existence, ranging in size from less than 50 connections to more than 1,000
connections, providing piped water to about 2.6 million beneficiaries (figure 3.3).

Institutional Issues: The larger sectoral context in which RWS programs operate has an
important role in ensuring their sustained service delivery (figure 3.4). In this context,
the roles and functions of the NWSDB, Department of National Community Water
Supply (DNCWS), and local authorities overlap somewhat and need clarification.
Although the DNCWS is the lead agency and has a clear mandate to oversee, monitor,
and give guidance to the RWS sector in the country, it is a relatively new agency, and it
needs technical and financial support to fulfill these functions. The NWSDB can provide
technical support to DNCWS mainly because of its current role of technical support
provider to CBOs. For example, the NWSDB has well-staffed RSCs (with RWS units) in
all the regions while DNCWS is currently in the process of establishing parallel district-
level structures. Furthermore, the NWSDB’s RWS unit has an existing database of
CBOs, which needs further support and resources to be complete and up-to-date, but
the DNCWS is collecting data for a new, parallel database.

   Note: Most Pradeshiya Sabhas support CBOs to provide rural water supply services, but a small number manage their own
   programs and provide water supply services directly to the population. In some of these cases, Pradeshiya Sabhas buy bulk
   water from the NWSDB.


Through their projects, development partners have tested different institutional designs
to support the CBOs. Model 1 placed the project management unit (PMU) within the
RWS unit of the Ministry of City Planning and Water and created a support structure


                                                                                 20

              TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY
for CBOs within the relevant provincial councils. Model 2 placed the PMU within the
NWSDB, and the support structure for CBOs was essentially the NWSDB with limited
connection to provincial or local government entities.Model 3 placed the PMU within
the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, where the support
structures were the local authorities (Pradeshiya Sabhas). These models have different
advantages and disadvantages. Placing the PMU within the RWS arm of the ministry
has not ensured continued, sustainable support to the CBOs, because the unit has
undergone many changes—from a unit to a trust to a department—during the past
decade. By contrast, placing the PMU within the NWSDB has resulted in stability and
continuity through the NWSDB’s regional structures to support CBOs for their technical
and operations and management needs, though this was not as effective for financial
supervision. Although Pradeshiya Sabhas can provide technical and financial support
because of their proximity to CBOs, their capacity to provide such support varies
widely (figure 3.5).

Access: As of 2012–13, an estimated 90 percent of rural households reportedly have
access to safe drinking water, mostly from protected dug wells, and almost 87 percent
had adequate water for washing and bathing (DCS 2015). However, these static figures
do not capture seasonal variability and adequacy of water available year-round. Unlike
in urban areas, where piped water supply is the norm, less than 15 percent of the rural
population has access to piped water, and the rest continue to experience the
inconveniences associated with fetching water either from dug wells in the yard or from
a distance. Focus group discussions with rural households conducted for this case study
suggest that many rural households meet their water needs by tapping a range of
sources. These include water provided by CBO program, trusted wells (either their own
or wells shared with neighbors), and buying drinking water from private providers,
along with using water from rivers, streams, irrigation tanks, and canals for washing
and bathing.

Adequacy and Reliability: Most CBOs provide far less than 24 hours of water supply
because of inadequate or seasonally varying supply at the source, inadequate labor for
operating the pumps, or unaffordable electricity bills. Focus group discussions with
beneficiaries (appendix C) revealed that most households manage by storing water in
500-liter overhead tanks or other large containers. Many use a range of sources,
including wells and buying water from private vendors. Economic constraints are
rarely the reason for using alternative sources. However, demand for piped water drops
during the wet season, when other sources are plentiful.

Quality: The quality of water supplied by CBOs is a major concern in many areas, and
focus group discussions with beneficiaries suggest that most households cope with this
by boiling or filtering the water (or both) or by using the CBO water for purposes other


                                             21
CHAPTER 3
TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY
than drinking. Beneficiaries have greater awareness of water quality because CBO water
is tested regularly — for example, under the Greater Kandy Water Supply Project
supported by JICA, the Katugastota Water Treatment Plant was equipped with
laboratory facilities to test CBO water in the Kandy District. According to data compiled
by the Ministry of Health, only 45 percent of water samples collected islandwide during
2013–15 were deemed to be of satisfactory quality compared with almost 77 percent for
NWSDB and 49 percent for private wells. 7 In some cases, fecal contamination from
proximity to poorly constructed on-site sanitation is responsible for poor water quality.
Despite training provided by the NWSDB, provincial councils, and Pradeshiya Sabhas,
many CBOs seem unable or reluctant to conduct daily chlorination because of cost,
unavailability of chlorine in remote rural areas, problems with storing chlorine bought
in bulk, and technical issues with operating the chlorinators.

The spread of CKDu adds an important facet to concerns about water quality in
Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Badulla, and Kurunegala Districts, and more recently in
Trincomalee, Ampara, Matale, and Moneragala Districts (Rajapakse S et al 2016).
Although CKDu affects less than 5 percent of the population in these districts, its rapid
spread and nonresponsiveness to treatment are of concern. Water treatment plants
using reverse osmosis have been set up at CBOs in some areas in the red zone of CKDu-
affected areas to remove both hardness and fluoride from groundwater, which are
considered possible causes of the disease. The reverse osmosis treatment plants—set up
primarily with assistance from the NWSDB, the private sector, and national and
international nongovernmental organizations (NGO)—are expensive to procure and
maintain, and may not be sustainable in the long term. However, if CBOs operate the
unit, revenue from sale of the water has provided them with additional revenue and
improved financial sustainability.

Affordability: A beneficiary household joins a CBO program by paying an initial
connection fee and monthly fees depending on use. At the outset of the program, the
household can choose to pay for the connection fee in cash (equivalent to between SL Rs
15,000 and 20,000), contribute labor, or a combination of both. This has proved to be an
affordable model for many who join during establishment of the program. Those
joining later can pay for the connection cost only in cash, which some may find difficult
to afford. In such cases, CBOs help by offering loans with extended payments. Bill
collection across a sample of CBOs shows substantial variation (table 3.4). Defaults in
payments are attributable to dissatisfaction with unreliable supply, faulty meters
resulting in disputed bills, and a perceived lack of authority on the part of the CBO.
CBOs tend to take a sympathetic view of default by households with economic
constraints or those with elderly and/or disabled heads of households and make special
arrangements to accommodate them.

functioning of CBO water supply programs. Although many CBO programs are
functioning well, a substantial number appear to be operating under considerable
strain, and a small number may have failed completely. For example, in Nikagolla
Village in the Matale District, the CBO established under the World Bank’s Second
Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project ceased operation one year after
establishment because of water source depletion. Five rural programs under the ADB’s
Secondary Towns Project are in distress, again because of supply problems. The most
important success factors for operational efficiency of CBOs appear to be technical
soundness of the initial design—particularly the choice of water source—and the
quality of construction. Poor technical design can be traced to insufficient time and
resources spent on identifying a suitable water source, a lack of local knowledge or
capacity on the part of consulting firms, and insufficient oversight by technical experts,
such as NWSDB staff. Even for CBOs that started out well, insufficient attention to
replenishment rates and activities to aid recharging has sometimes resulted in ground
wells failing to produce the expected volume of water. In Mallacoota in the Kandy
District, for example, the CBO program (also established under the World Bank’s
Second Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project) aimed to supply 115
households, but it can only meet the demand of 60 households every other day.
Discussions with officials indicate that in such cases, a few CBOs have attempted to
identify additional suitable water sources, but such resources have not been available
for this purpose.

CBOs have developed financial sustainability and greater community ownership
through diversification of CBO activities (microcredit, for example). In addition to
providing local services, which increases the CBO’s involvement in community
activities and has a positive effect on bill collection, such activities also further
strengthen the financial status of CBOs. However, to ensure ownership and
sustainability, the CBO itself should make decisions for diversification. Depending on
their size and power, financial strength can be a two-edged sword for a CBO because
other players, such as local politicians, reportedly seek to interfere in the management
of successful CBOs. Strong CBO leadership and support from reputed and respected
government institutions, such as the NWSDB, can support CBOs in successfully
managing these issues.

CBO Management, Leadership, and Capacity: Focus group discussions with CBO
members and leaders, both past and present, identified the capacity of the CBO leaders
as the most critical issue in the overall success of managing and operating a water
supply program. This is not surprising, and the World Bank’s Second Community
Water Supply and Sanitation Project devoted time and resources to mobilizing a new
group of community leaders who were not the traditional elites of the village, providing
them with the skills to mobilize and lead a CBO. Building on the Community Water

Supply and Sanitation Project model, the ADB’s RWS development projects have
supported partner organizations—often a local NGO selected by the NWSDB through a
competitive bidding process—to mobilize communities and identify potential CBO
leaders while facilitating project implementation. For example, in rural programs
designed under the ADB’s Secondary Towns Projects, the involvement of local NGOs
(which placed a staff member in the village for up to two years) during program design
raised awareness and encouraged community participation (especially by women) in
program planning, duly assisted by technical and training support provided by
government water agencies during the CBO establishment and subproject
implementation phases. However, in practice (as suggested by the sample analyzed for
this case study), CBO leaders are still generally drawn from among traditionally
influential members, such as the school principal or public sector employees, while new
leaders are often still in training and in the second line of leadership and responsibility.
In most cases, one or two key leaders carried the burden of the CBO, functioning in
voluntary positions in the executive committee. Although many do not have any
significant technical knowledge, the critical attributes appear to be the possession of a
problem-solving orientation and a strong commitment to service.

Efforts have been made to improve the capacity of CBO leadership. Approaches
included the CBO Forum hosted by the NWSDB’s RSCs, which is held periodically in
some regions. However, it is clear that CBOs continue to need strong and consistent
support in institutional and technical matters if they are to maintain and improve
service delivery. Technical aspects regarding operation and maintenance, particularly
concerning what to do in the case of contamination, are often beyond the capacity of
village CBO leadership. Effective financial supervision is often beyond the capacity of
the village membership. The NWSDB, which has a strong presence at the regional level
through its RWS units located within the RSCs, has reached out to the CBOs or been
sought out by them, and provides effective technical support in most cases. Effective
financial supervision is often provided by the Pradeshiya Sabha, but even in the small
sample of cases examined in depth for this case study, there is great variation in the
capacity and interest of the Pradeshiya Sabhas to carry out this function.

The three development partners have had an important role in supporting RWS
services in Sri Lanka. During the past decade alone, development partner–supported
programs have provided new piped water connections to more than 200,000
households, benefiting more than 900,000 people in rural areas. The World Bank’s
Second Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project completed and
operationalized 709 water supply subprojects that provided new piped water
connections to 92,000 households and access to improved water sources to 384,100
people, and constructed or rehabilitated 922 improved water distribution points.
Similarly, the JICA-supported Eastern Province Water Supply Development Project is

estimated to have served 209,000 people with 24-hour water supply and provided
41,000 new house connections. ADB’s Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan 1993) provided water to 252,569 rural
dwellers or about 60,000 households. Through the years, development partner–
supported projects have provided space to innovate and test various models of service
delivery mechanisms based on the CBO model (figure 3.5) with substantial cross-
learning between the projects. These projects and the learning they have generated have
fundamentally shaped the RWS sector in Sri Lanka.


Urban Sanitation
Service Delivery Modes and Institutional Arrangements: The Colombo Municipal
Council is responsible for the sewerage network in the core city area, and the NWSDB
offers piped sewage services in the outskirts of the city. The NWSDB, under JICA’s
Kandy City Wastewater Management Project, is designing and constructing a sanitation
system in Kandy (Sri Lanka’s second-largest city) that will be handed over to the Kandy
Municipal Council for operation. Piped sewerage systems are present in a few other
secondary towns, such as Kataragama and Hikkaduwa. However, most urban residents
rely on on-site sanitation through septic tanks and closed pit latrines served by bowsers
and vacuum trucks from municipal and urban councils. These institutions have varying
levels of capacity to carry out their mandate, and they sometimes must fall back on the
technical capacity of the NWSDB to continue services. Without a concerted effort to
build minimum levels of capacity, it is a moot point whether allocating responsibility to
these various institutions will yield the desired results (figure 3.6).

Access: Overall, in contrast to piped water supply (which has covered most urban
areas), sanitation infrastructure is greatly lagging current needs and is in danger of
falling behind further as urbanization increases. More than 90 percent of urban
residents have access to a toilet facility exclusively used by their household, just 2.7
percent rely on public toilets, and no households are without toilets, but piped
sewerage systems presently cover less than 12 percent of the urban population.

Environmental Impacts: Without a functioning septage management system, septic
overflows can spill into the nearest water bodies, and liquid wastes from poorly
designed on-site systems infiltrate groundwater. For example, in highly congested
urban areas such as Muttur, Trincomalee District, and Akurana, Kandy District, safe
disposal of septic tank waste is particularly important because of the high density of
housing and the nature of the terrain. The public health inspectors for these areas noted
that it is common practice for households to release overflow from septic tanks and pit
latrines into rainwater drains and rivers. Because this is illegal and a serious health risk,



                                             27

they noted that it is done in secret either at night or during rains, when it cannot be
detected. 8

The implications of such practices can be far-reaching for the environment, living
conditions, and human health. Although causes have yet to be determined, there is
mounting evidence of groundwater pollution in Muttur, and residents complain that
their well water is becoming increasingly contaminated, is turning a dark color, and has
a strong odor, making it unfit for human consumption. The situation in Muttur suggests
that in addition to cities and large towns, highly congested small town areas—
particularly in the north and east, which have mostly been neglected because of the
conflict—are in urgent need of improvements in O&M of on-site sewage treatment and
collection facilities and investment in well-functioning septage management or piped
sewerage systems. Greater capacity to monitor environmental impacts is also important.
JICA is currently supporting a technical assistance project, Monitoring of the Water
Quality of Major Water Bodies, which is expected to strengthen water quality
monitoring and management capacity of the Central Environmental Authority
concerning river pollution control, particularly in the Kelani River.

Poor Management of Solid Waste: According to officials, poor management of solid
waste is adding to the environmental degradation and health risks posed by inadequate
sanitation infrastructure in urban areas (Jagannathan 2016). There is considerable
ingress of solid waste into the sewerage system, contributing to system blockages and
damage to the infrastructure. Major improvements are needed to streamline collection,

              TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY
segregation, and proper disposal of solid waste through sanitary landfills, which Sri
Lanka still does not have. Without professional garbage collection and disposal
systems, continuing adverse impacts on water bodies are likely, leading to poor health
outcomes, and flooding in urban areas because of clogged drainage and sewer systems.

Operational Efficiency: The sewerage system in Colombo City was constructed more
than 100 years ago, and some sewers are in poor condition or are under capacity and
experience collapses, serious blockages, and overflows. The system is further stressed
by the recent rapid development of the city, particularly the commercial developments
and construction of high-rise apartments. Effective methods of knowledge and capacity
transfer from the NWSDB to the municipal councils are needed, especially when they
will be taking on the sewerage management responsibility for the first time, as in the
case of the Kandy Municipal Council. However, these services are not well organized,
and they are often inadequate to meet needs, leading to poor performance of sanitation
infrastructure. On-site facilities, particularly if they are not well constructed, are
unsuitable in the context of the high population density and housing conditions
prevailing in most urban areas in the country, especially because poor septage
management at the household level can have immediate repercussions for the
household and neighboring houses.

In the urban sanitation subsector, the three development partners have supported the
provision of sewerage connections to households, and improved sewerage systems and
wastewater management in cities, including Colombo, Kandy, and Jaffna. JICA
supported the Kandy City Wastewater Management Project and aims to provide a
modern sewerage system for the city of Kandy, providing improved sanitation access to
55,000 people, which will lead to improved water quality of the Mahaweli River. ADB’s
Greater Colombo Wastewater Management Project, approved in 2009, aims to address
blockages in the network, reduce flooding due to pipe blockages, and cut down on
overflow and collapses in the sewerage system. JICA is also providing technical
assistance to develop a National Sewerage Master Plan of Sri Lanka and city sewerage
master plans for prioritized cities. In the formulation of the National Sewerage Master
Plan of Sri Lanka, a study of 79 cities was completed that included 64 municipal
councils and union councils, 25 district capitals, and some large population centers. Five
cities were selected for the implementation of the City Sewerage Master Plan, and the
City Sewerage Master Plans were completed for Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte,
Anuradhapura, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, and Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia.

CHAPTER 3
TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY

Rural Sanitation
Access: About 90 percent of the rural population had access to toilet facilities within
their premises in 2012–13. Often, these are pour flush, squatting toilets located within
the compound in an outhouse. Where piped water is available, households may have
another toilet within the house. Focus group discussions in rural locations suggest that
the few households that do not have a toilet facility exclusively for their own use are
usually subfamilies that share the same compound as the parental home. There is no
evidence of dissatisfaction with the availability of toilets, and open defecation is
reported to be highly uncommon and limited to small pockets in coastal areas and
estates, often driven by preference rather than lack of facilities (table 3.5). 9

Groundwater Contamination: Given the number of individually constructed toilets
spread across rural Sri Lanka and the potential variation in their design and
construction quality, there is a possibility of groundwater becoming polluted within the
household compound. Public health inspectors are required to respond to a request or
investigation if a disease outbreak occurs. The inspectors are also required to certify and
monitor new pits and septic tanks, though it is unclear to what extent this is occurring.
Reports of water contamination due to sanitation appear to be rare. However, the lack
of proper septic tanks, lack of systematic programs to educate householders and
builders (including recommended separation in various soil and toilet types), and lack
of systematic studies of groundwater flows where wells and toilets coexist have
substantial implications for groundwater quality in rural areas and may result in future
environmental and health problems.

Institutions and Regulation: Unlike most other developing countries, where the main
challenge is providing access to improved sanitation facilities, Sri Lanka faces
additional problems concerning regulation, monitoring, and supervision of rural
sanitation facilities. The default responsibility for managing sanitation is mainly the

no technical support is available to the household—such as a latrine design manual or
set of guidelines covering a range of designs and including advice on separation from
wells—to design and build a safe and environmentally sustainable sanitation facility.
However, focus group discussions reveal that rural households are generally aware of
the need to refrain from placing water sources and toilets close to each other, though
they may not be familiar with norms for separating the facilities.

Feedback from government officials suggests that rural sanitation in Sri Lanka is
generally unmonitored and unmanaged. According to the rural water and sanitation
sector policy adopted in 2001, the responsibility for ensuring quality and standards of
services in relation to both water and sanitation resides broadly with local government
(MUDCPU 2001). Although there is substantial variation of capacity across local
governments, the large majority of Pradeshiya Sabhas do not have the technical
knowledge in-house regarding sanitation technology, such as how to design
environmentally sound septic tanks or promote innovative technology and methods to
address rural sanitation. In addition, where the Pradeshiya Sabhas carry out septic tank
pump-outs, there is a need to construct and operate septage treatment plants with
proper disposal.

During the past decade, interventions by the three development partners in the rural
sanitation sector have focused mainly on assisting rural households to construct toilets,
and more than 120,000 toilets have been constructed in rural areas under projects
supported by the development partners. For example, the World Bank’s Second
Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project provided a revolving sanitation fund


                                                     31

TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY
that supported the construction of 45,600 latrines. Additionally, ADB’s Dry Zone Urban
Water and Sanitation Project provided support to local authorities to improve their
services in pit desludging, and septage handling, treatment, and disposal. JICA is
working at the macro level regarding rural sanitation, supporting the development of a
national sewerage master plan through the technical assistance project Strategic Master
Plan under Sewerage Sector.


Water Supply and Sanitation in the Estate Sector
The estate sector in Sri Lanka includes about 1 million people (less than 5 percent of the
country’s population) and consists of areas with cash crop plantations with more than
20 acres of land and 10 or more resident laborers. Historically, the estate management
rather than the government has provided services to the estate population. As a result,
10.9 percent of the estate population is poor compared with 2.1 percent of the urban
sector and 7.6 percent of the rural sector (DCS 2015).

Access to Improved Water Supply: Although conditions in the estates have
significantly improved in the past decade, access to safe water remains an issue. Only
about 47 percent of the estate population is reported to have access to safe drinking
water, typically supplied through gravity-based pipes that serve up to 125 families, and
supplemented by wells and rainwater harvesting. The rest still rely on open,
unprotected water sources, such as rivers, streams, irrigation tanks, and springs. Data
are limited regarding access to piped water in the estate sector, but informal
calculations suggest that just 2 percent of households have connections. 10 In
comparison, 92 percent in urban areas and 15 percent in rural areas have connections.

Access to Improved Sanitation: Improved sanitation facilities covered 76.2 percent of
the estate population by 2012–13 compared with 90 percent for the rural sector.
Sanitation is mainly through on-site latrines, but their construction quality is uncertain
because there are many reported instances of water-source pollution due to unsanitary
latrines used by the plantation communities. The regional plantation companies, with
support from the Plantation Human Development Trust, typically manage the
programs.

The development partners have had limited engagement in WSS in the estate sector. Of
38 projects active during 2007–16, only one project refers to the estate sector. The World
Bank–supported Second Community Development and Livelihood Improvement
Project has constructed 467 community water supply projects and 695 sanitation
subprojects, some of which are in the estate sector. Because of the estate sector’s special
features (plantation management provides basic services instead of the state), the most

               TRENDS AND ISSUES IN URBAN AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SERVICE DELIVERY
appropriate institutional model to deliver water and sanitation services to estate
populations is still unclear. Various community-based models with varying levels of
ownership and participation by the plantation companies have been tried with the
assistance of development partners, but they have achieved limited success, mostly
because of low capacity and low interest in managing WSS programs among estate
populations.


1 Per the current definition used by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), only
municipal and urban council areas are considered urban. However, town council areas were
also considered urban until 1987, when town councils were abolished, and their areas were
absorbed under the Pradeshiya Sabhas, which are in the rural sector. The DCS definition is
thought to substantially underestimate the degree of urbanization and the urban population in
Sri Lanka; by some estimates, the urban population is thought to exceed 8 million, or about 40
percent of the population (Weeraratne 2016). The water sector institutions use a different
definition from that of DCS; according to the National Policy for Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation (2001), Pradeshiya Sabha areas with a population of more than 6,000 are identified as
urban for the purposes of water supply and sanitation services.

November 11, 2016.
3 What constitutes “access to safe water” is still under debate in Sri Lanka, and different

agencies use different definitions, resulting in different statistics. This report follows the DCS
definition, which is “protected well within premises, protected well outside premises, tap inside
home, tap within unit/premises (main line), tap outside premises (main line), water project in
village, tube well, bowser, and bottled water.”
4 This is calculated based on average household size of 3.9.
5 ADB Loan 2947 is assisting the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) with

reducing non-revenue water levels in Colombo. JICA (in 2009) and ADB (in 2012) also provided
technical assistance.
6 However, water tariffs were reduced by 10 percent just before the presidential election in

January 2015.
7 The Ministry of Health has facilities to test chemical parameters in three laboratories and to

test bacteriological parameters in six laboratories.
8 This information is from interviews with the focus group team on August 25, 2017 (Akurana)

and August 27, 2017 (Muttur).
9 However, dissatisfaction with the adequacy of toilet facilities available in public buildings,

such as schools in rural areas, is substantial (Fan 2015).
10 This is according to the Deputy General Manager, RWS, NWSDB on March 30, 2017.

4. Engaging with Development Partners
Donor Coordination
Sri Lanka is at a mature stage of development coordination in the WSS sector (ADB and
JICA 2017). The government is increasingly taking the lead in policy design and
implementation, and coordinating the government’s planning processes and systems
with the engagement of the development partner community. A formal mechanism for
coordinating activities among development partners in the Sri Lanka WSS sector,
initiated by AFD and affiliated with the Development Partners Forum coordinated by
the World Bank Sri Lanka Office, ceased functioning in late 2015. However,
development partner representatives in Colombo and government officials confirm that
informal networks and communications continue, keeping all parties aware of ongoing
programs and involvement. Despite the lack of formal coordination arrangements, close
engagement between each development partner and the government, and informal
networks and information sharing among the development partners has resulted in
good coordination in the field, avoiding geographic and issue overlap and duplication
of efforts. 1

However, feedback from interviews conducted during the joint mission and from a
broader cross-section of government officials at the Joint Case Study Workshop
(appendix D) suggests that although development partners rightly point to a lack of
coordination among government agencies, they should also pay greater attention to
coordinating among themselves. Suggestions included the following: Development
partners should not compete to provide loans, but rather coordinate more among
themselves for better government service delivery; consider pooling funds into one
basket and allocating them to utility agencies with a specific regional focus; and avoid
extreme branding—that is, different operational and reporting requirements that make
the state-sector partner deal with them as projects without being sufficiently integrated
with those of the government system or with projects of other development partners.

Feedback from focus group discussions in the field also calls for specialization and
coordination on the part of donor agencies. For example, one development partner may
have greater strengths in community-based activities and another in building technical
capacity. Some respondents in the field expressed concern about the quality and
commitment of NGOs and private contractors (“They came, did what they could, and
left without any arrangements for follow-up and ongoing support”). 2 In many cases, the
NGOs and private contractors operated only during the project period and have since
ended their operations, dissipating the knowledge and capacity gained. In this context,
the development partners may have a role in supporting the development of a more

                                                                                  CHAPTER 4

stable, knowledgeable, and skilled set of NGOs and private contractors to support WSS
projects in rural Sri Lanka.

Participants in the joint workshop highlighted the long delays associated with
procurement procedures. This is seen as arising partly from government delays, and
from the need to obtain approval on a case-by-case basis, sometimes from the head
office of the development partner. Although the objective of procurement guidelines is
to enable the borrower countries to procure high-quality goods and services as
economically as possible, ‘small print’ in the procurement guidelines often results in the
rejection of many bids. Consequently, there is a perception that Sri Lanka has become a
“dumping ground for low-quality equipment.” The message is that procurement
guidelines need revision to improve speed and quality while preserving the core
procurement principles. One solution suggested was for the development partners to
coordinate and set out a common prequalification of suppliers, contractors, and
consultants, which would eliminate the need for a prolonged approval process for each
procurement. Another suggestion was for greater flexibility, which may still achieve the
desired outcome—for example, allow rectification of omissions or deviations in the bid
rather than outright rejection. Overall, workshop participants strongly expressed a need
to review and revise procurement guidelines to enable the sector to meet the increasing
demand for effective service delivery in the next decade, an area that is likely to benefit
from greater coordination among development partners.


Challenges and Constraints
The main challenges facing the WSS sector in Sri Lanka that emerged from this review
relate to covering the last mile in achieving universal access to water supply, ensuring
water quality (especially in CKDu-affected areas), providing broader coverage by piped
sewerage networks, and securing water resources for current and future demand.

CHALLENGES
Beneficiary-focused service delivery, especially in rural, “rurban,” and small town
areas: Service delivery for water supply in rural, rurban, and small town areas
regarding piped water access, adequacy and reliability, and quality is significantly
below that of urban areas. 3 Sri Lanka’s aspirations for middle-income status call for
bringing the rural areas up to the level of urban areas.

Ensuring water quality: A well-resourced management system is required to ensure
water quality, one that combines effective monitoring with timely response. At present,
comprehensive and regular testing of CBO water is constrained by insufficient
monitoring of CBOs to ensure that they send samples for regular testing, and by limited



                                            35
CHAPTER 4
ENGAGING WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
laboratory facilities to conduct tests. In addition, even when quality issues are known,
solutions are not readily available because of technical and resource constraints. The
CKDu-affected areas are of immediate concern and require a quicker and more
comprehensive response.

Expanding water resources for adequate and reliable supply: Across urban and rural
areas, rising incomes and aspirations are increasing the demand for water and
competing with the parallel and growing demand from agricultural and industrial
users. Rural areas—especially in the north and northeastern areas—have inadequate or
seasonally varying water supply. NRW is still at a high level in the Western Province,
particularly in Colombo, mainly because of aging infrastructure, and any reduction of
losses would augment the amount of water available for consumption.

Expanding and upgrading urban sanitation, thus improving living conditions and
safeguarding the environment: Insufficient coverage, aging piped sewerage networks,
and issues with the quality of on-site sanitation have strong implications for living
conditions and the environment. Sewage seepage and overflow affect peri-urban and
low-income areas disproportionately and contaminate groundwater and surface water
bodies.

Covering the last mile for universal access, especially in estate areas: Improved water
supply is lacking for 53 percent of the population in estate areas, for 5 percent in rural
areas, and for 2 percent in urban areas. Improved sanitation is lacking for 24 percent in
estate areas, 3 percent in rural areas, and 12 percent in urban areas. These figures have
remained essentially stagnant for the past few years and will require significant
incremental effort to reduce the gap.

Addressing the challenges described involves overcoming several constraints. These
cover the availability of wider and quality data for program planning and monitoring;
intersectoral coordination; complexities in policy and institutional arrangements;
financial constraints for infrastructure improvement; and inadequate technical capacity.

CONSTRAINTS
Lack of data on service delivery: The current state of data in Sri Lanka’s WSS sector is
inadequate for planning, implementing, and measuring progress toward improved
service delivery in all of its important dimensions of adequacy, reliability, and quality,
especially outside the large urban areas. In this respect, Sri Lanka’s situation is similar
to that of most other developing countries. However, standards need to be raised much
higher if the sector is to support the national development goals for economic growth.
Beyond a point, knowing that a certain proportion of the urban or rural population
lacks access to improved water supply or sanitation services is of little value if

                                                          ENGAGING WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
information is lacking on where these deficits are located. There is currently little clarity
on what constitutes adequacy, reliability, quality, and affordability for water supply
services in urban, rural, and estate contexts. Local governments that need to act on
water and sanitation provision call for a very different data collection program and
process. Similarly, other sectoral agencies that impinge on service delivery—those
dealing with water resource management, health, environment, and pollution—require
specific, actionable data to coordinate their actions with the institutions that are
primarily responsible for WSS services.

Various institutions currently collect data related to water supply, and there is often
overlap and lack of alignment among the various sources. Specifically, the RWS
division under the NWSDB collects data on CBOs, as does the newly created DNCWS
in parallel. Coverage data vary substantially between what the water supply
institutions provide and what is reflected in the national survey, which is the
Household Income and Expenditure Survey conducted by the DCS.

Intersectoral coordination: There is much to be done in improving coordination
between institutions that are primarily responsible for WSS and those whose
cooperation is needed to improve various aspects of service delivery, especially water
resources management, public health, environment and pollution, and municipal solid
waste management. Various aspects of this case study highlight the importance of each
of these functions. For example, officials responsible for environmental and pollution
regulation need to work with local government agencies to monitor pollution levels and
provide feedback for better wastewater and septage collection and disposal. Public
health authorities should be able to track problems and promote improvements in
sanitation and wastewater collection and treatment. There is also a need to coordinate
planning and construction of WSS infrastructure with the Road Development
Authority, particularly pipe laying to avoid having to lay pipes again because of
changes in road design. The existing arrangements need to be made more systematic,
and coordinated action across institutions needs to be informed by sound data and
information.

A crowded policy landscape for WSS: There are more than 50 acts of parliament
concerning the water sector. Key legislation includes the Forest Ordinance of 1907 and
its amendments; the Land Development Ordinance of 1935; the Crown Lands
Ordinance of 1947; the Soil Conservation Act No. 25 of 1951 and No. 29 of 1953; the
Water Resources Board Act of 1964; the National Water Supply and Drainage Act of
1975; the Land Grants Act of 1979; the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979; and the
National Environmental Act 47 of 1980. Although there is legislation to mitigate most of
the problems related to WSS, it is administered by numerous agencies with a wide
range of responsibilities (figure 4.1), resulting in overlaps, gaps, and conflicting


                                             37

ENGAGING WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
jurisdictions (FAO 2011). In 2005, there were 19 bilateral agencies, three multilateral
agencies, and 11 United Nations (UN) and related agencies supporting the WSS sector. 4
Most of these are continuing to support the government in the sector. Overall,
sustainability of current water resource use practices and efficiency of use have been
under threat for the past few decades, partly reflecting the state of relevant policies and
the lack of planning and coordination of legislative amendments.

Lack of institutional clarity for important functions: This is most prominent in
providing administrative and technical support to CBOs. The DNCWS has a mandate to
oversee, monitor, and give guidance to the RWS sector in the country, but the DNCWS
is a relatively new unit and needs technical and financial support to fulfill its function of
providing technical expertise to CBOs. At the same time, the NWSDB has well-staffed
RSCs (with RWS units) in all the regions. This puts NWSDB in a good position to
provide guidance through its RSCs to parallel units that DNCWS is creating at the
district level. However, this raises the question of whether having two lines of
support—one through RSCs and the other through the DNCWS district-level units—is
an efficient arrangement. Regarding onsite sanitation, existing legislation places
responsibility on the local government, but the Water Board Act charges the NWSDB
with managing sanitation with the consent of local government, which requires a level
of coordination and cooperation that may not be obtained easily in practice.

Financing shortfall for infrastructure needs: The national target for piped water
connections is coverage of 60 percent of the population by the year 2020, much of this
through expansion of the NWSDB network. NWSDB estimates that this effort would
require an annual investment of $80 million from 2016 on and has projected a
substantial gap in investment (NWSDB 2016b). Calculation based on international data
and information from World Bank projects suggest that during the 2010–20 period,
improvements to the water and sanitation sector would require an annual investment of
between $75.5 million to $154 million, or approximately 0.13 to 0.26 percent of GDP
(Biller and Nabi 2013). The investment gap is proposed to be met partly through funds
from the government and multilateral and bilateral donors, which may not be sufficient
for the scale of investment required. There is a need to leverage private finance on a
fiscally sustainable basis, such as through public-private partnerships, which can help
to address gaps in the urban sanitation subsector. 5

Note: Local authorities, such as CMC, KMC, and Pradeshiya Sabhas, are important players in providing WSS. CBO =
community-based organization; MCPWS = Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply; NWSDB = National Water Supply and
Drainage Board; WSS = water supply and sanitation.

Insufficient capacity at various levels: Sri Lanka needs to strengthen its local
contractor and technical consultancy industry, especially for urban sanitation. The
procurement guidelines do not cover this aspect sufficiently, and it relates to supporting
the development of the local contractor and consultancy industry, which is in the WSS
sector’s long-term interest. Outright rejection of bids that are not considered
substantially responsive and long delays between the bid submission and award of a
contract work against the development of the local contractor and consultancy
industries. As discussed in the section on RWS, CBO capacity for technical and financial
management of water supply varies widely, and the weaker CBOs need arrangements
for reliable and responsive support. The overlap, lack of institutional clarity, and
inadequate resources to provide the needed support must be addressed to achieve any
significant improvement in RWS.


Addressing the Challenges and the Role of Development Partners
ADB, JICA, and the World Bank, as Sri Lanka’s key development partners, have played
a significant role in supporting the country’s WSS sector during the past decade, as
reviewed in this case study. Going forward, they have much to contribute by using their
individual strengths in policy advice, technical assistance, capacity building, and

ENGAGING WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
investment assistance to overcome the challenges and constraints discussed in the
preceding sections. The findings and analysis suggest that the development partners
should coordinate in their future sector engagement with the Sri Lankan government
regarding the following:

   •   Policy and regulatory reform: Support the government in WSS regulatory
       reforms, notably in establishing transparency in water tariff setting.

   •   Focusing on the lagging areas: Sri Lanka has achieved impressive gains in
       relation to access to improved water and sanitation, but these increases appear to
       have leveled off in the past several years, highlighting the particular difficulties
       of providing service delivery in difficult-to-access, lagging areas in the rural
       sector and in estates. Reaching these thinly populated and remote locations
       would require new and innovative thinking because business-as-usual may not
       be able to meet the specific challenges associated with delivering sustainable
       services in communities hindered by technical, institutional, and capacity
       constraints.

   •   Adapting and strengthening the CBO model: The CBO model has delivered
       good results overall, but it needs to adapt according to the context, to rising
       consumer expectations for service delivery, and to their decreasing willingness to
       contribute in-kind to water supply facilities and upkeep. Ways to professionalize
       the management of CBOs according to size and need should be explored. A
       greater role for the NWSDB and local government or Pradeshiya Sabhas may
       become necessary in some cases. Hybrid models may be considered that combine
       close links to the CBO with the level of technical input that the NWSDB can
       provide, together with effective and close financial supervision. Clarity in
       institutional responsibility to support weak CBOs is needed to make this
       mechanism effective and responsive.

   •   Urban sanitation—expanding, and strengthening O&M of off-site sewerage
       and on-site facilities and creating value chains for safe and efficient removal of
       fecal sludge and organic wastes: Support the government in taking a balanced
       and phased approach to expanding urban sanitation and strengthening O&M for
       sewage treatment and collection facilities. Recognizing the scale of challenges in
       urban sanitation may not be met cost-effectively or promptly by extension of the
       sewerage network alone, O&M of on-site facilities need to be improved in the
       short and medium term through, for example, assistance to install domestic
       wastewater treatment or septic tanks, construction of treatment facilities for the
       removed septage, and technical support. Given the large incidence of on-site
       sanitation, value chains and incentives can be created for septage management in

                                                                              CHAPTER 4
                                                     ENGAGING WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
    cities and small towns. Scope exists for using public-private partnerships, such as
    those created through performance contracts. Other countries have done this
    successfully, such as the Philippines for septage management and Vietnam for
    reducing NRW by locating and fixing leaks. This can also have the effect of
    improving in-country technical and consulting capacity. Other, newer options
    exist for combining organic domestic wastes with sludge to produce biomethane
    fuel, and the digestate can be used as fertilizer. Although these newer options
    may not be least-cost solutions to the problems at hand, developments after the
    21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the UN Framework Convention on
    Climate Change provide opportunities for closing the viability gap while
    yielding strong local environmental benefits and global greenhouse gas benefits.

•   Investing in a modern, responsive data system to underpin planning and
    service delivery: Creating a database for service delivery (adequacy, reliability,
    quality, and affordability) is necessary to shift the focus of sector strategy from
    access to service delivery. Such a database will enable planners to get a true
    picture of service delivery, which is almost nonexistent for most of the
    population living outside urban areas. It should allow improved physical and
    financial planning, regulation, environmental monitoring, intersectoral
    coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and customer satisfaction. It will also
    enable a more systematic and efficient engagement with development partners,
    who can use the information to better align their strengths with the diversity of
    sector needs. Sri Lanka is ideally placed to develop a modern system using
    geotagging, mobile phone apps, and the Internet, given the country’s
    telecommunications connectivity, human resources, technical penetration,
    transportation facilities, and relatively compact geography. This exercise will
    help the government in developing a programmatic approach to address the
    needs in the WSS sector, and to have development partners combine their efforts
    in a more complementary manner to achieve common sector outcomes. At the
    same time, development partners could work with the government to develop
    consistent definitions of different parameters to operationalize Sustainable
    Development Goals indicators, which can help the various partners work toward
    a common goal.

•   Enhancing mechanisms for intersectoral coordination: Enhance existing modes
    for intersectoral coordination and develop new modes where necessary to ensure
    physical, social, and environmental sustainability of service delivery to address
    concerns. These include the current and growing concern for water resource
    management to keep pace with growing demand from the domestic, agricultural,
    and industrial sectors; water quality in general in rural areas and particularly in
    CKDu-affected areas; the impact of poorly managed solid waste on sewerage and


                                         41
CHAPTER 4
ENGAGING WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
        flooding; and better implementation of groundwater and environmental
        regulation. All of these concerns underscore the need for ministries and agencies
        responsible for these functions to enhance existing mechanisms or create new
        ones for coordination with WSS institutions, underpinned by improved data.

    •   Adopting integrated urban water management and circular economy concepts:
        Build upon improved intersectoral coordination to introduce integrated urban
        water management practices. Reduce and eliminate unregulated dumping of
        urban liquid and solid waste in water bodies and on land, and operationalize
        circular economy concepts through adopting new and relevant technologies,
        which can also contribute to methane capture and reuse.

JICA’s sector background report (footnote 4; Chapter V, VI) provides a detailed discussion and
analysis of donor coordination and its evolution in Sri Lanka.
2 However, note that ADB’s rural water supply (RWS) projects, which were modeled on the

earlier World Bank project based on the CBO approach, addressed this by incorporating
significant input from nongovernmental organizations (NGO) in the CBO villages for two years
during initial design and implementation.

been developed.

http://www.lankalibrary.com/news/NGO.pdf.
5 Note that in this context, public-private partnerships can provide a number of benefits (for

example, value for money, enhanced service delivery, sustainability of operations and
maintenance, and access to alternative sources of capital), but not all projects will be suitable for
procurement through this route.

Executive Summary

This report presents the community-level data collection carried out by a separate team as
part of data collection for the Joint Case Study of the Water and Sanitation Sector in Sri Lanka
by Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the
World Bank Group. The objectives of this exercise were to listen directly to the “voice of the
people” who are the final beneficiaries of the projects, and community members who
manage water programs on behalf of their village; explore new issues and enable existing
hypotheses and outcomes to be understood in greater depth; and triangulate data for greater
accuracy to understand how a given issue can be experienced differently by different groups,
and how outcomes can be prioritized differently by different groups.

A portfolio of methods and data sources was used to meet these objectives. These included
focus group discussions with final beneficiaries and leaders of the community-based
organizations (CBO) that manage the individual projects; key person interviews with officers
of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) Rural Water Supply (RWS)
unit, local government (Pradeshiya Saba) and public health service officers working directly
with the beneficiary communities, and site visits.

The analysis contained in this report draws from a limited number of locations and is not
meant to be generalizable to all rural and urban water programs funded by the development
partners, but it provides a local perspective that is often absent in evaluations of activities
supported by development partners. The data have been rigorously triangulated at the local
level, which is often not possible for the evaluation departments of development partners
given the time, cost, and language limitations of evaluation missions.

JOINT CASE STUDY FOCUS GROUP REPORT
Summary of Findings

IMPROVED ACCESS

The water supply programs in the sampled locations have met a need; in all locations, the
large majority of households have connected to the water supply program. Piped water is the
households’ primary water source because it is convenient and reliable. However, most rural
households continue to maintain a variety of sources, such as their own well, a common well,
rivers, and springs. In the sampled locations, economic constraints were rarely the reason for
using alternative sources. Most connected households continue to use alternative water
sources because of their high quality (for example, well water for drinking) or because of
habit and cultural conditioning (for example, the preference for well, tank, or stream water
for bathing and washing clothes).

The water supply is quantitatively adequate when it is sufficient to meet household needs.
None of the CBOs sampled provide 24-hour supply because of the need to ensure equitable
distribution when water is limited, labor constraints to operate the pumps, the cost of
electricity, and preventing wastage from overflows. The connected households know the
supply days, and they adjust to available sources and manage availability by storing water
while prioritizing usage of project water for needs that call for proximity and quality.

 Except for the Serunuwara program, all the water projects have design elements
incorporated into the infrastructure to improve water quality to raise it to an acceptable
quality for household use. Households are aware that CBO water is not of drinking quality,
and most cope with that by boiling it, using water from traditional drinking water wells, or
buying water.

There is widespread acceptance among the rural respondents that the benefit of CBO water is
worth the cost. The benefit is most often based on access and convenience rather than savings
on expenditure. Saving on the cost of transporting water was mentioned as a secondary
factor. Inability to pay the bill was not one of the reasons that households did not connect.
Tariffs for CBO water are higher than NWSDB and Pradeshiya Saba tariffs; most CBO
beneficiaries are aware of this difference and accept it.

Both CBO leaders and beneficiaries felt that most defaults were not due to economic
constraints. Defaults were caused by unreliable supply, faulty meters causing disputed bills,
and lack of CBO authority to enforce bill payment. However, a few households default
because of economic constraints. These are households with elderly and/or disabled heads of
household or chronically poor households. All CBOs take a sympathetic view of these
households, acknowledging their critical need for water despite their inability to pay.

The findings from the urban sites where NWSDB was providing water differed substantially
from the rural sites receiving CBO water. Because there was no CBO involvement, the urban
users had no knowledge or opinion on the management of the water supply. They relied on
piped water to a much greater extent than rural users. In Alainagar and Jayanagar, the
respondents felt the NWSDB tariff rates were unaffordable and the cost of connections too
high.

BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES

All respondents—regardless of age, gender, or livelihood—cited proximity and reliability as
the primary benefit of piped water. The main benefits identified were the convenience of
having the water in the compound and not having to travel to get it; reliability of supply
during seasonal shortages of alternative sources; and quality (suitability for drinking). The
benefit to the elderly is beyond general convenience because they are incapable of accessing
water that requires a long walk or a steep or irregular climb.

Water-borne diseases, such as dysentery, typhoid, and diarrhea, were not reported as an
issue. The viral hepatitis epidemic in Serunuwara in 2015 was the most severe disease
reported that was directly related to water. The beneficiaries from the areas most affected by
chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) were convinced that early symptoms of
CKDu have been brought under control by drinking water purified by reverse osmosis.
(Although the CBO does not run the reverse osmosis plant, it uses the CBO water).

A discussion on sanitation was included because it was a focus area of the main study.
However, there was no dynamic discussion—respondents felt access to sanitation is
generally good, and thus the communities did not see it as a significant issue. The public
health inspectors were concerned about possible noncompliance with safe practices, such as
the use of soap in the toilet, despite high levels of awareness. In urban sites, illegal discharge
of sewage into the rainwater system is causing serious health and pollution impacts.

FACTORS AFFECTING SERVICE DELIVERY

A basic analysis of the focus group discussion data identified the initial design and
implementation of the project infrastructure; CBO leaders and the institutional structure of
the CBOs that manage the water program; and external institutional support as the main
factors that affected the delivery of water.

The technical soundness (design and quality of construction) of the infrastructure is
fundamental to successful and sustainable service delivery and is an enabling factor in CBO
management. The choice of the source, capacity of the storage tank, purification methods

installed, and so on, have a direct impact on the supply of water. Where the infrastructure
has been inappropriate or quality shortcomings exist, the CBO had to incur higher
operational costs, and the water supply has suffered. The latter has caused disruptions in
supply and quality, which caused friction between the CBO and water users.

All three of the Second Community Water Supply and Sanitation (CWSSP2) projects had a
period of extreme uncertainty when the CBO collapse was imminent. The CBO leaders were
unable to find suitable solutions to supply-related problems that arose after the programs
were handed over to them. Weaknesses in the water supply had led to the habit of defaulting
on bill payments, which affected the financial sustainability and the authority of the CBO.
According to the CBO leaders, they were overwhelmed by the responsibilities and financial
issues involved and had no external institution or authority to turn to for help. Two CBOs
(Pallekotuwa and Werapitiya) overcame this period when new leaders joined the CBO and
succeeded in accessing the NWSDB-RWS for external supervisory assistance.

Unlike the CBOs set up under the CWSSP2, the Kolongolla CBO, which was funded under
the Eastern Province Water Supply Development Project (EPWSDP), has been stable since its
inception. The reasons discussed at the focus group discussion with CBO leaders pointed to
the continued role of the local government (Pradeshiya Sabha) in supporting the CBO and
providing it with authority. Unlike the other three CBOs, the Kolongolla CBO was set up as a
Praja Mandalaya, a legal entity endorsed by the Ministry of Local Government and
Provincial Councils and working directly with the Pradeshiya Saba.

                   JICA–World Bank–ADB Joint Evaluation Workshop:
                         Achievement and Future Challenges of
                      the Water and Sanitation Sector in Sri Lanka
Introduction

Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the World Bank, and Asian Development
Bank (ADB) are conducting a joint case study for fiscal year (FY) 2016 on Sri Lanka’s water
and sanitation sector to assess the achievement of assistance in the past 10 years and to
enhance coordination of development partners’ strategies and activities in the future. JICA,
in collaboration with the World Bank and ADB, hosted a workshop to contribute to the joint
case study “Achievement and Future Challenges of the Water and Sanitation Sector in Sri
Lanka.”

The workshop’s objective was to bring together selected stakeholders in the water and
sanitation sector to raise understanding and awareness of the sector’s changing environment
and challenges, and to identify areas in which government institutions and development
partners could provide assistance to respond to various country-level needs to enhance
inclusive and quality water supply and improve sanitation in Sri Lanka. Two primary
outputs expected from the workshop were:

   •   Enhance common understanding of the challenges and possible entry points for both
       government institutions’ and development partners’ future strategies in the water and
       sanitation sector based on country needs and demands
   •   Foster, catalyze, and strengthen partnerships among participating stakeholders to
       contribute to national ownership and better coordination across development partners
       in the sector.

Group 4: Sector Policy and Planning: Tracking service delivery outcomes

   •   Tracking progress toward Sustainable Development Goals
   •   Improve data for programmatic lending
   •   Intersector coordination
   •   Water resource management.

The joint mission members facilitated the discussion for each group. First, each participant
received sticky notes to write down the most critical issues for group discussion considering
the issue’s alignment with the themes and topics. Facilitators organized the notes on a board
to clarify cause and effects so that each group could identify problem trees and summarize
possible solutions. At the end of the session, each group presented its discussion summary to
plenary. The presented summaries are as follows:

   •   Policies. Policies are needed to provide guidance on water resource allocation,
       catchment management, water conservation, reuse and recycling, and land use. The
       group noted that investing in water conservation and catchment management
       activities could significantly offset the high costs incurred for mobilizing additional
       capital and minimize water treatment costs. Ideally, establishment of a water apex
       body empowered by an umbrella legislation should be developed that outlines the
       priorities for water uses—this was attempted in 1990s under ADB technical assistance
       to establish the Water Resources Council and the Water Act. However, this was
       unlikely to be achieved in the short term. An overarching policy outlining how
       different pieces of legislation on water, resource use, and allocations could be applied
       in a coordinated manner could be a first step, given the numbers of actors and
       legislation related to water management in Sri Lanka (for example, National Water
       Supply and Drainage Board Act, Irrigation Act, and so on). Undertaking marketing

       and raising awareness of such a policy to gain widespread support from government
       and the public is equally important.
   •   Regulations. Regulations by the Public Utilities Commission are needed to address
       water quality and tariffs and to guide requirements for cost recovery to meet sector
       investment and long-term sustainability (linked to customer services standards). More
       work is needed to engage customers at different levels to raise awareness of service
       standards (awareness of water value and production cost is currently low) and how
       water tariffs are linked to achieving desired levels of service. Ownership from
       consumers is needed to increase willingness to pay and to understand the cost of
       providing a reliable water supply service.
   •   Water database. Establishment and promotion of a national-level database is required
       to facilitate preparation of a comprehensive water sector plan (including a water
       resources inventory, land use, disaster management and emergency response,
       irrigation patterns, and demand projections). This central source of information,
       continually updated, could be valuable for the government to inform future planning
       for sector development programs. The group noted that each water supply program is
       developing water safety plans, which could link to a water sector plan.
   •   Project procedures. An assessment is needed of the cost effectiveness of lengthy
       project formulation, and concurrence and procurement procedures (focused on
       program scale instead of project level). Donors and development partners need to
       review current approval procedures and requirements to allow more flexibility, which
       may still achieve the same desired outcome (for government and donors).
   •   Role of donors. The future role of donors and development partners needs
       clarification regarding achieving national sector development objectives. The
       government also has to take responsibility in preparing a comprehensive sector
       development plan at the appropriate level that provides detailed sector objectives and
       program outcomes within a prescribed time frame (the Mahinda Chintana plan is at a
       macro level and therefore is not immediately operational in the field). This plan could
       be a useful tool to coordinate donor investment and support, building on the key
       strengths and experiences of each external development partner agency.

   •   Rural sanitation. At present, the default responsibility of constructing a latrine lies
       with the individual household. The responsibility to regulate rural sanitation lies
       broadly with the local government—however, the regulatory system is not properly
       managed and regulations are not systematically imposed. This, in turn, has enormous
       implications for groundwater quality. Poorly constructed septic tanks and lack of
       verification of separation between wells and septic tanks has an impact on human
       health and groundwater pollution. There is low capacity and knowledge among local
       authorities about how to design proper septic tanks and administer them. Education
       and training are needed at different levels—planning, designing, project
       implementation, and contracting.
   •   Urban sanitation. There is a need for greater clarity regarding institutional
       responsibility and accountability for urban sanitation—this is crucial for donors in
       planning and providing technical assistance and training. Preferably, the same agency
       should be in charge of both water supply and sanitation wherever feasible. Per
       existing ordinance, onsite sanitation is the local government’s responsibility. But
       under the Water Board Act, NWSDB has authority to manage sanitation with the
       consent from local government. The primary responsibility for urban sanitation needs
       clarity and policy. Administrative boundaries should not limit sewerage
       infrastructure—practical catchment areas should be considered instead. The
       advantages and disadvantages of decentralized versus centralized sewerage systems
       also need consideration. The question of responsibility and accountability arises only
       if capacity exists at local government authorities. Local governments’ capacity varies,
       and they have to rely on NWSDB as needed. NWSDB is implementing the Kandy City
       Wastewater Management Project and will hand it over to local government, the
       Kandy Municipal Council (KMC), but KMC’s capacity is an issue that needs to be
       addressed in parallel. Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has good technical capacity,
       but KMC has relatively less. NWSDB’s capacity is more dependable and structured. A
       master plan should clarify the roles and responsibilities of local government
       authorities in relation to NWSDB. (JICA is formulating a plan, but it is more for site
       selection for investment planning.)
   •   Pollution: Dumping of septage is uncontrolled in several areas, and peri-urban and
       rural areas are affected. There is greater availability of septage treatment facilities
       compared to a 10 years ago, but there is a long way to go for any substantial coverage.
       The only check for water quality is through the public health inspector (PHI). In

       addition NWSDB checks urban water quality regularly and rural (CBO) water quality
       biannually when samples are presented. NWSDB monitors effluent from its water
       treatment plants (WTPs) and waste water treatment plants (WWTPs).
   •   Capacity to construct sanitation infrastructure: Construction capacity for sanitation
       infrastructure is very low—construction and contracting, especially for specialized
       sewerage construction works. Labor turnover is very high, particularly for
       rehabilitation and maintenance work. As a result, there is excessive dependence on
       foreign contracting.
   •   There is a greater demand among the population for water supply services than for
       sanitation.

   •   Policy, planning, and strategy. Government’s strategy for rural water supply is
       unclear. However, some participants noted that lack of strategy might not hinder
       operations in the field at the individual program level. Others stressed the importance
       of clear strategy so that the investment for rural water supply would be done
       consistently. Although rural water supply programs deliver a substantial portion of
       pipe connections, there is not enough financial support for CBOs for rural water
       programs’ operation and maintenance. Urban water needs substantial investment;
       however, it is also important to continue investing in rural water supply programs.
   •   Institutional clarity. The roles and functions of NWSDB, DNCWS, and local
       authorities are somewhat overlapping regarding rural water supply, and they need
       clarification. The group discussion confirmed that DNCWS is the leading agency and
       has a clear mandate to oversee monitor, and give guidance to rural water supply in
       the country. However, DNCWS is a relatively new agency and needs technical and
       financial support to fulfill these functions. NWSDB can provide technical support to
       DNCWS. Coordination among DNCWS, NWSDB, and local authorities is highly
       important, and these three should work together toward the same objectives: deliver
       enough, safe water to rural people.

   •   Role of donors. Donors often claim that coordination among government agencies is
       lacking; however, they should also examine any lack of coordination among
       themselves. Donors should not compete to provide loans, but instead coordinate more
       among themselves for better government service delivery. Donors should consider
       pooling their funds and allocating them to utility agencies with a regional focus.
   •   Financial and technical sustainability. Diversification of CBO activities (microcredit,
       for example) should be encouraged to strengthen the CBOs’ financial status. However,
       the CBO should make decisions for diversification to ensure ownership and
       sustainability. Too much cash in the bank account attracts various stakeholders’
       interests and makes CBO management difficult. The best practice to avoid problems is
       to turn the cash into assets that are useful for the CBO (vehicles, for example). But cash
       is needed operations and maintenance, such as pump replacement and the like.
   •   Opportunities for mutual learning among CBOs is highly important for their
       sustainable management. Some regions periodically hold a CBO forum, and the
       NWSDB’s Regional Support Centre (RSC) hosts the forum secretariat.
   •   Water quality. Water quality is a major issue in rural water supply. Among other
       means of water supply, harvesting rainwater and storm water could be one of the
       solutions to provide clean water to rural beneficiaries (storm water harvesting may
       require some level of treatment).

   •   National level coordination on water and sanitation policies. A national level apex
       body to decide project priorities and proper coordination among stakeholders (such as
       NWSDB, Road Development Authority (RDA), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB),

       Department of Irrigation, and others) is indispensable. Organizational reforms should
       be considered, if needed. Solid, long-term policies on water and the sanitation sector
       should be established, and a priority list for projects should be approved for a period
       of at least 10–15 years. Guidance should also be provided on how different
       stakeholders can manage necessary administration for providing infrastructure
       facilities, land acquisition requirements, and right of way. Currently, implementation
       delays (such as delays in procurement and land acquisition) hinder project efficiency,
       which should be addressed through improved intersector coordination.
   •   Formulation and planning. Water supply project formulation and planning should
       consider all intersector components: networks (what roads lines are involved); the
       timing of proposed programs and projects and their implementation period,
       geographical coverage, and distribution to avoid overlapping projects; funding
       method; and overall management with all relevant stakeholders.
   •   Funding arrangement for programmatic lending. The Ministry of Finance Budget
       Department should first set the targets for the sector budget allocation, including
       established timelines. Funding allocation and defined priorities will allow for more
       efficient, effective use of the limited resources. The criteria for project priorities should
       be clearly set and consider project benefits, such as the number of population/area
       and special cases.
   •   Water resource management. A central body should be defined or established that
       decides on water abstraction rights and coordinates its management among sectors.
       For example, policies for water resource sharing at the river basin–level are currently
       lacking. Water resource management policies should emphasize the importance of
       securing drinking water. Pollution control for existing water resources is an urgent
       issue that needs addressed.
   •   Donor coordination and tracking progress toward Sustainable Development Goals.
       Donors should support an integrated development approach.
