About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of

    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      The re safety drawings are presented to the Fire Service Authority. The cost

      Agency : Private rms

      BuildCo will request a soil test for the structural calculations for the
      foundation.


      For the warehouse, as described in the case study, the standard penetration
      test is what would most likely be done, which is a simpli ed procedure for
      this type of study, since the warehouse is not a very complex project. Soil
      testing helps to determine the properties of the soil, which can vary from
      place to place. The soil investigation helps to determine the bearing capacity
      of the land, which in turn helps to determine the load capability, the type and
      depth of foundation, in order to make sure to select a suitable construction
      technique.

      Topographic Surveys are used to identify and map the contours of the land
      plot. Its purpose is to serve as a base map for the design of a building. It also
      shows the boundary lines and is used by designers to accurately show the
      required setbacks. It is used for the site plan, which is a mandatory
      requirement for all construction.

      Depending how complex the building is, an environmental impact
      assessment report, a hydro report and a tra c management report may be
      required.

       Once the preliminary approval has been obtained, the architect will submit
       the following to the Town and Country Planning Department:
       - 4 sets of drawings, including the septic tank drawings
       - Fire permit
       - Soil report – not applicable for Doing Business case study
       - Structural Assessment for buildings that are 3 storeys or higher - not
       applicable for Doing Business case study
       - Copy of the title certi cate and the form from the Land Commission
       showing correct ownership
       - EPA clearance certi cate – for all developments
       - Tra c management report – when applicable (mainly for big developments
       in downtown Accra).
       - Approval of architectural and engineering design


       The TCPD has been decentralized and so the local level in Accra is part of the
       Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA). To start the approval process for the
       building permit, a technical committee is set up by the TCPD, including other
       o cials within the AMA. After the technical examination, a recommendation
       is made to the Statutory Planning Committee (SPC). The SPC is an
       intergovernmental committee made up of o cials from the TCPD, Works
       Department, Land Commission Survey Department, the Environmental
       Protection Agency, the Survey Department, the Fire Service, and utility
       companies who meet periodically to approve building permits. They are
       required by law to have reviewed the application within 3 months after it is
       submitted and to inform the applicant of their decision.

       The applicant will be informed of the amount of the processing fees and the
       time limit of 3 months starts as soon as the processing fees have been paid
       both for the development permit and the construction permit.

       There will be a joint inspection by TCPD and the Works Department and each
       department will issue their own recommendations. BuildCo does not need to
       be present at the inspection.


       The fee schedule for the building permit is as follows: 0.625% of construction
       cost processing fee of GHS 50 for the development permit GHS 84 30% of
       GHS 66 per gross oor area of 5000 square ft for the construction permit.

       Inspections are to be carried out by the building inspectors at the end of
       each phase of the building: foundation, oor level, lintel, roo ng, and
        nishing. Special coupons are provided when the building permit is granted,
       and the builder is supposed to send the appropriate coupon to the
       authorities informing them of the completion of that phase so that an
       inspection can be conducted. In practice this is rarely done. However,
       building inspectors are regularly sent to inspect buildings under
       construction.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Once the lawyer has obtained all the necessary information regarding the
      title, the lawyer drafts the sale and purchase agreement. Both buyer and
      seller sign the agreement. The cost is based on the Bar Association
      Guidelines, however the suggested fees for conveyancing are maximum
      rates and can be negotiated down. The maximum cost for a property
      transfer for the case study would be 10% for rst GHS 200,000 and the
      remaining balance of property value at 7.5%. However, it is common for
      lawyers to negotiate down this cost around 5% of the property value.

      Stamp Duty is assessed and paid at the Land Valuation Division. The buyer
      presents the deed of assignment to the Land Valuation Division. The
      property is inspected to ascertain its current open market value. The buyer
      pays Stamp Duty to the Land Valuation Division of the Lands Commission.
      The Stamp Duty Act of 2005 (Act 689) established a new duty schedule for
      property transfers. This Act states that for the conveyance or transfer on the
      sale of a property, the stamp duty is 0.25% where the property value is less
      than GHC 10000. For properties valued between GHC 10000 and 50000,
      stamp duty is 0.5%, and for properties valued above GHC 50000, stamp duty
      is 1%.

       document is placed in the land parcel le. The owner will use the property
       after the title is issued by Land Title (in areas covered by Land Title
       Registration) or when the Deed has been registered under the Deeds
       Registration Act and Development Permit granted by the Assembly. Most
       often property owners do not wait to go through these processes before
       making use of the land.

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees
                                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)             - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                       commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                               - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                 - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                       movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

   Labor Market Regulation
Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
