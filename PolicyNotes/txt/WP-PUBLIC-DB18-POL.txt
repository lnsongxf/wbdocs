About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Since January 1, 2012 a new alternative method for establishment of a
        company has been introduced that does not require notarization of the
        company's agreement. However, the system was only ready to be used in

        according to a simple form of the articles of association, which can be
        modi ed only to a certain extent.

    2   Deposit paid-in capital at the bank                                               1 day              no charge
        Agency : Commercial Bank

        The procedure of opening a bank account di ers from bank to bank. Banks
        always require the company's articles of association and some banks may
        also require REGON and NIP certi cates (which as a rule are obtained
        together with National Court Registration number but may also be obtained
        independently before KRS registration). The National Court Register does
        not issue NIP and REGON automatically to the bank, however the bank can
        check this data on the internet platform of National Court Register which is
        easily and publicly available.



        Some banks require a whole set of registration, statistical and tax certi cates
        to open a bank account. In such case, a bank account can practically be
        opened only after the company is registered at the National Court Register.
        While the law provides for the obligation of the founders to pay the entire
        share capital before applying to the National Court Register to register a
        company, at the same time it does not authorize the National Court Register
        to verify whether such payments have actually been made. The Register can
        only verify the management board's statement in this respect. Therefore, in
        practice, if the company does not manage to open a bank account before
        registration in the National Court Register, the respective amounts to cover
        a share capital are temporarily deposited either at the founders' accounts or
        an account opened by the management board member(s), and are
        subsequently transferred to the company`s bank account once it is opened.

       The registration with the National Court Register determines the creation of
       a new business entity and is binding for other authorities such as: Tax O ce,
       Statistical O ce and Social Insurance O ce. Newly established companies
       are given their tax identi cation number (NIP) and statistical number
       (REGON) automatically within few days of court registration. Additional
       required information should be submitted directly to the authorities after
       the registration. After registration of the company, the National Court
       Register sends the registration data to a newly established central register of
       taxpayers (Centralny Rejestr Podmiotów - Krajowa Ewidencja Podatników).



       The National Court Register o ers online registration. However, the
       electronic registration is not used by the majority of rms for various
       reasons. The e-registration requires an electronic signature or ePuap as well
       as the presence of at least one shareholder and management board
       members with electronic signatures or ePuap pro le. Also, the electronic
       system provides for a very simpli ed template of articles of association of
       the new company allowing modi cations to a limited extent only. Online
       registration system was introduced in 2012, and became operational in 2015.

      Agency : City Administration

      Obtaining a current geodesic map is necessary for preparing a building
      project. According to the Building Code, a building project should consist of
      an architectural project; a major planning scheme of the plot; declarations of
      energy, water and sewage, and other suppliers, if applicable; a declaration by
      the administrator of the public road about the possibility of connecting the
      plot to the public road; the results, if applicable, of the geological
      examinations; and a speci cation of the geotechnical conditions of the
      property.


      One of these documents, the major planning scheme of the plot, should be
      corrected by an expert on a copy of the most recent geodetic map. Such a
      map is collected by the division of the County O ce (Starostwo) or, as in
      Warsaw and some other cities, by the relevant division of the city
      administration. This map is valid for only about 6 months, which explains the
      need for it to be constantly updated. Once obtained, the map need to be
      updated by a private surveyor or by the and approved by the local
      administrative o ce of surveyors (Municipality of Warsaw).

      In practice majority of companies hire a private surveyor who obtains the
      map from the municipality (or online) and makes the necessary corrections
      on the outdated map. This will cost around PLN 2000 which includes
      administrative fees payable to the municipality.

      Agency : Licensed Sanitary Expert

      The building project must be reviewed by a licensed sanitary expert. An
      expert approves the project by a xing his or her name stamp and an
      approval/non approval clause to the project. The authority issuing building
      permits then checks whether this procedure has been completed by the
      expert.

      Agency : Fire Safety Expert

      The building project must be reviewed by a licensed re safety expert. Fire
      safety experts are supervised by the Commander of the Fire Department
      and appointed by the Polish General Commandant of the Governmental Fire
      Department. An expert approves the project by a xing his or her name
      stamp and an approval/non-approval clause to the project.

      The Project Documentation Coordination Unit (Zespół Uzgodnień
      Dokumentacji Projektowej, ZUDP) consists of city o cials, representatives of
      utility companies and representatives of any agency that might manage
      cables, pipes or other underground material. ZUDP meets once every 3
      weeks to analyze the proposed project of connecting to the utilities and
      check if there is any con ict among the di erent networks. The obtaining of
      this approval can be done simultaneously with obtaining other pre-                                                    Page 15

       approvals before obtaining the building permit. The building permit cannot
       be issued without the positive opinion of ZUDP. The investor- or its
       representatives – are invited to participate when ZUDP meets, but they are
       not required to be there.

       Agency : Municipality (O ce of Architectural and Building Administration)

       Construction work cannot begin before BuildCo has obtained the building
       permit. To acquire the building permit, the investor must send the o cial
       application form to the appropriate o ce of architectural and building
       administration at the Municipality.

       The following documents should be attached to the application:
       • Four copies of the building project, with all opinions, adjustments, permits,
       and other documents required by the particular legal acts
       • The investor's formal written statement concerning the right to dispose of
       the real estate on which the building is to be built
       • The decision regarding the conditions of building in the area, as stated
       within the framework of a binding special layout plan, if such a decision
       (which is not obligatory) was issued before applying for the building permit

       The opinions, adjustments, and permits mentioned above should be
       acquired by BuildCo or its attorney. In practice, they are obtained by the
       architect who prepares the project.


       The building project should be accompanied by a document certifying that
       the project designer is registered as a building expert. The decision on the
       conditions of building in a certain area is obligatory when the area is not
       covered by a binding special layout plan.


       In 2006, the o cial fees changed slightly due to the adoption of the new Law
       on O cial Payment. As of 2007, these fees amount to PLN 539.00 for
       issuance of a building permit (PLN 1.00 per sq. m., but no more than PLN
       539.00) and PLN 47.00 for approval of the building project. PLN 2.50 is added
       for the cost of wire transfer. Thus, the total cost is about PLN 588.50. In case
       the application is to be signed and led by an authorized representative, an
       authorization should also be attached.


       The legally allowed time for making an administrative decision granting a
       building permit is 30 days (Administrative Code, General Administrative
       Regulations, Art. 35.3), but Article 35 Section 6 of the construction law
       provides 65 days for resolving di cult cases. Even so, the administration
       frequently reviews a case for a few months as it can sometimes requests
       many new documents and an explanation from the applicant and can
       suspend proceeding with the application until these documents and
       explanations are submitted.
                                                                                                                Page 16

       provides 65 days for resolving di cult cases. Even so, the administration
       frequently reviews a case for a few months as it can sometimes requests
       many new documents and an explanation from the applicant and can
       suspend proceeding with the application until these documents and
       explanations are submitted.

       Formally, the time to validate the administrative decision is 14 days from the
       date it was delivered to the parties. In practice, the investor should expect
       that other parties, such as neighbors and ecological organizations, will
       appeal against this decision. Appeal cases may take a few years.

       Therefore, making an administrative decision can take from 60 days (legally)
       to 365 days (in practice), while validation takes from 14 days (legally, and with
       no trouble arising) to 4 years (in case of appeals).

       Since February 1, 2013, the Mayor’s o ce must enter the date of application
       and the date the permit was delivered. It is electronic and the application can

      Agency : Innogy Stoen Operator

      The application to the utility (Innogy Stoen Operator) can be submitted
      online, however, the following documents are required: type of building,
      entitlement to use the building, the service requirement, the

      information on the client (REGON/NIP/Bank account), map with plan of the
      building, Spacial-Programme Conception, and a copy of the building permit.
      No external inspection is required.

      After processing the application, Innogy Stoen Operator will send the
      technical conditions and a draft contract showing the amount to be paid –
      the connection fees (the connection fees include the cost of design, all the
      materials and labor cost). Connection fees are annually approved by the
      Regulator.


      Once the client agrees to the technical conditions, the contract is signed.

      Agency : Innogy Stoen Operator

      Once the fees are paid, Innogy Stoen Operator hires an engineering
      company (surveyors, designers) to do the electrical design and to obtain all
      approvals and decisions required by law. This engineering company is
      usually di erent from the company/electrician which is hired by the
      customer to do the design of internal wiring in his building or on his plot.
      The designer will also contact the client to discuss where the collection box
      should be located (i.e. the work on the property itself is done by the client).


      Once the design has been approved by utility, the engineering company
      submits all documents related to the construction of connection to the
      municipality. For instance, for a 140kVA power connection, an underground
      cable is necessary and in order to lay the cables, the engineering company
      needs to get municipal approval for the external connection works.


      Meanwhile, Innogy Stoen Operator hires a construction company to build
      the connection in the eld and construct the connection including
      excavation and the use of drilling machine (faster and recommended
      technology) to lay 150 m low-voltage cable on the ground.

      Innogy Stoen Operator will be physically present on the day that the
      contractor (the owner’s personal contractor) is ready to pull the cables and
      connect them to the connection box. All work on the property of the
      warehouse is to be done by the private contractor of the client that is pulling
      the cables from the warehouse to the connection box (installed by utility,
      with the connection box ready to receive those cables with stops to prevent
      any further surge). Once this connection is done, Innogy Stoen Operator will
      give to the Owner a protocol that the connection is nished. This protocol is                                          Page 25  
      necessary to sign the supply contract.

       Agency : Electricity supplier

       After the external connection works have been approved, the customer
       concludes a supply contract and waits for the opening of the meter.


       Electricity cannot ow if the client has not signed a contract with a provider
       of electricity but the supplier will not sign a contract unless the owner has
       the protocol provided by Innogy Stoen Operator stating that the connection
       is nished. Once the signing is done, the supplier will inform the utility
       directly that they have been chosen by the client to be his/her electricity
       provider (supplier).

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.



What the indicators measure                            Case study assumptions

courts (calendar days)                                 between 2 domestic businesses. The case study assumes that the court
                                                       hears an expert on the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Outcome             going concern     Because the value of an operating hotel is higher than selling its assets piecemeal, it is most
                                      likely that BizBank and Mirage management will agree that it is in both of their best interest

Time (in years)     3.0               It will take 2-3 weeks for Mirage to prepare the bankruptcy application. After the application
                                      is submitted, it will take approximately 2 months for the court to appoint the judges and for
                                      the judges to review the case and issue a declaration of bankruptcy. After the declaration is
                                      issued, it must be published in the official gazette and at least one local newspaper (14 days).
                                      After the announcement is published, it may take up to 2 months to hold the first hearing
                                      with all the creditors present. The participants are likely to agree that the hotel should
                                      continue operating and the court will appoint an administrator to supervise the operations
                                      (up to 2 months). The creditors will then submit their claims to the administrator, who will
                                      prepare a list of creditors to be approved by the court. This process can take up to 11
                                      months. After that, the court will likely decide that the company should be liquidated and will
                                      appoint a liquidator (up to 4 months). The liquidator must inventory and appraise the assets,
                                      which is a lengthy procedure and may take up to a year, because all participants can express
                                      opinions on the value of the assets and several appraisers may need to be hired to satisfy
                                      the objections of the debtor and creditors. After all the assets are appraised, the liquidator
                                      will organize an auction for the sale of assets. Usually, at least two auctions will take place,
                                      because most buyers will wait for the second auction, as the price at the second auction will
