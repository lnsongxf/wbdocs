    Contract for Supervision and Verification of Quality of Waste Collection in Jamaica
    Contract Size: $71,000
    Description: As part of a $42 million loan from the World Bank for the Jamaican Integrated Community
    Development project, the Government of Jamaica is aiming to improve access to basic urban infrastructure
    and services, and contribute towards increased community safety in selected economically vulnerable and
    socially volatile inner city communities of Jamaica. The communities included in the project lack access
    to regular solid waste management services, water connections, and legal electricity connections. While
    infrastructure is a key part of the loan, the Government of Jamaica also seeks to change behavior to ensure
                                                   sustainable practices, especially for solid waste management.
                                                   Using results-based financing, the Government of Jamaica is

                                                   from these volatile communities. To verify the results, a non-
                                                   governmental organization was procured for a 1-year pilot to
                                                   regularly monitor and evaluate three communities with regards
                                                   to cleanliness and frequency of waste pickup.

    Contract to Develop Urban Waste Management Plans in Burkina Faso
    Contract Size: $66,000
    Description: As a part of a Technical Assistance funded by the Korean
    Green Growth Trust Fund, the World Bank supported select African
    countries to assess ways to improve the solid waste sector, in response
    to a pressing need for financial assistance and technical expertise in the
    management of solid waste in Africa. Addressing the underperformance
    of solid waste management could generate significant environmental
    and health benefits and could improve the overall livability and
    urban resilience of municipalities in the region. In Burkina Faso, a
    firm developed solid waste management plans for four cities, which
    included legal, regulatory, and institutional assessments of solid waste
    management, an assessment of the performance of solid waste facilities,
    and recommendations for short- and long-term goals, as developed in
    consultation with relevant stakeholders.
    Selection process: A competitive bidding process was conducted by the
    World Bank following the World Bank corporate procurement policies
    based on technical and financial criteria and the posting was advertised
    globally. The World Bank contracted the selected firm, and the contract
    was managed by World Bank staff.

 Contract to Conduct Waste Picker Study in Mauritania
 Contract Size: $30,000
 Description: The Global Partnership for Output Based Aid provided grant funding that enabled the World
 Bank to provide Technical Assistance to the Government of Mauritania to assess opportunities to formalize
 the recycling system in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Waste management in Mauritania, and especially in the
 capital city of Nouakchott, is inhibited as municipalities do not have the financial and human resources to
                                                     address proper solid waste management. This challenge
                                                     is exacerbated by rapid urbanization and rural exodus,
                                                     which has transformed the country from about 5%
                                                     of the population living in urban centers during the
                                                     1970s to nearly 70% of the population living in urban
                                                     centers today. The World Bank-funded study aimed to
                                                     characterize the solid waste value chain economy and

                                                     Community’s waste management policy.
                                                    Selection process: A competitive bidding process was
                                                    conducted by the World Bank following the World Bank
                                                    Corporate procurement policies based on technical and
                                                    financial criteria and the posting was advertised globally.
                                                    The World Bank contracted the selected firm and World
