About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Four of the procedures are taken care of by having the four relevant
        agencies dispatch one of their civil servants to the one-stop shop. This is:
        • The tax authority to register the bylaws;
        • The Commercial Registry (‘Registre du Commerce et du Credit Mobilier’ -
        RCCM) to register the company bylaws;
        • The NINEA to get a company identi cation number (‘Numéro
        d’Identi cation National des Entreprises et des Associations’); and,
        • The Labor authority to register workers and commencement of operation.

        They are all physically located in the same location and there is a timesheet
        kept by the coordinator of the one-stop shop that indicates the precise time
        with which every person in the room delivers the document.


        Another two procedures are handled by the one-stop shop, and these are:
        • Registration at the Social Security (‘Caisse de Securite Sociale’ - CSS);
        • Registration at the Pension Fund (‘Institut de Prevoyance Retraite’ - IPRES).

        These two agencies are not physically located inside the one-stop shop but
        are a few minutes away. What is done is that when a new le comes in, the
        coordinator of the one-stop shop sends the information about the
        application by email to these two agencies. He then phones them to make
        sure that they received the email. Later in the afternoon (or if it afternoon,
        the next day), the one-stop shop sends a courier to go and fetch the
        approved documents.

        Fees, for rms with a capital lower than 10,000,000 FCFA, the applicant needs
        to pay:
        • Registration fees: XOF 25,000 for the statutes
        • Court Registrar fees: XOF 30,000 if the capital is XOF 1 000 000 + XOF 90 for
        any other XOF 1,000,000 of capital.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      of his/her lease, a copy of the land title and the details of the connection. The
      copies do not have to be notarized. The technical study is also sent to
      Senelec for approval, and they will then need to undertake a site inspection.
      Moreover, Senelec will need to get an authorization from the 'ageroute' at
      the Ministry of Transport to go over the road and make sure there will be
      su cient room between the road and the cabling. This authorization is an
      internal process between Senelec and the ageroute. Once the authorization
      is granted and the site is approved by Senelec, the customer is noti ed by
      letter.

      The electrical contractor that carries out the technical study also orders and
      purchases the necessary material and brings it to the utility for approval.
      The meter board has to be bought directly at Senelec by the customer or the
      electrical contractor doing the external connection works. The transformer
      has to be bought privately and then be brought to Senelec for a control.

      During the works, the utility will supervise the works. For instance, an initial
      inspection happens at the beginning of the external works. The customer or
      the electrical contractor has to go to the utility after the rst inspection to
      obtain a written note from the utility that con rms the inspection (procès
      verbal). The works in the meantime go on. When the works are nally done,
      the contractor will need to get approval from Senelec via a nal inspection.

      After the external connection works are nished, the electrical contractor
      writes a letter to Senelec and within a week, the utility carries out an
      inspection of the works. After this, the client can make a request for
      electricity turn-on ('mise sous tension'). O cers from the Senelec from the
      network o ce (internal division of Senelec) will then come and evaluate the
      impact of the electricity turn-on and assess the length of the necessary
      power cut (neighbors have to be cut o in order to connect the new
      customer). After this, a date for the electricity turn-on can be scheduled.

       After the nal inspection of the external works and the inspection for the
       electricity turn-on, the customer goes to the commercial section of Senelec
       to pay a the security deposit. The exact amount depends on the requested
       load and the estimated monthly consumption. Once the advanced
       consumption is paid, the utility informs the equipment section and asks
       them to connect the customer. A meeting is held each Tuesday to program
       cuts, which usually occur on weekends. Power is restored once the new
       connection is made and electricity starts owing.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Land Registry ("Conservation Foncière")

      This Procedure allows the State to exercise its preemption rights and
      possibly to acquire ownership of the property. At the same time, if the
      Conservation Foncière considers that the property is undervalued, it will
      request an expert to value the property.


      There is a time limit for the government to exercise its preemption rights. If
      no answer is received after that time limit, it is considered that the property
      transfer has been authorized. As of 2014, it is only required to notify the
      Ministry of Finance and it does not stop the property transfer process.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                     Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest      registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business 2018         Senegal


    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the             - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                         and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

                                                            - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                          equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                  - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                            commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

  Case management (0-6)                                     - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                    - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                      - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding           liquidation        As Mirage will not be able to settle its current liabilities with its available assets, it will file a
                     (after an          declaration of cessation of payments (article 25 of the Uniform Act Organizing Collective
                     attempt at         Proceedings for Wiping Off Debts). In order to continue operating, Mirage will try to obtain
                     reorganization)    the opening of reorganization proceedings and avoid liquidation. Under article 27, a

                                        creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court will convert the
                                        proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of the proposal (article 33 of the
                                        Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that is later converted into liquidation is the most
                                        likely proceeding in Senegal.

Outcome              piecemeal sale     According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the proceedings will
                                        probably be converted to liquidation. The hotel will stop operating and will be dismantled,
                                        and the assets of the debtor will be sold separately.

Time (in years)      3.0                Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of
                                        reorganization proceedings. The declaration has to be done 30 days following the cessation
                                        of payments. The competent court will then declare cessation of payments and open
                                        reorganization proceedings. The composition proposal will fail, so the proceedings will be
                                        converted to liquidation. According to our estimations, the complete process of a
                                        reorganization attempt that is then converted to liquidation takes approximately 36 months.

Cost (% of           20.0               According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted into
estate)                                 liquidation costs approximately XOF 20,200,000 (20% of the value of the estate). The following
                                        cost components are applicable: lawyer fees (10%), bailiff fees (15%), court fees, costs of
                                        publication and registration (1%).
