grid cell were derived by integrating over the nine return

Estimates of the GDP and population affected by earth-
quakes in 2080 were based on the 2080 socioeconomic
and climate conditions associated with the five Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) created by the Intergov-

﻿used in this publication were based on the Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) created by the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the Fifth
Assessment Report (ARS). The RCPs were used to force
the five climate models, listed in table 2, to simulate daily
future climate data. The future flood hazard estimates
were subsequently calculated using the same GLOFRIS
model cascade described above but forced with the daily
future climate data from the five climate models. The
precipitation estimates for the climate models were bias
corrected using the 1960-99 EU-WATCH data and a meth-
odology developed by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model
Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). For details on the bias
correction, see Hempel et al. (2013).
Future flood risk for 2080 was then estimated for scenar-
ios that combined the projections of the flood hazard and
exposure data based on the RCPs and SSPs in table 3.
For more information on the RCPs, see Meinshausen et
al. (2011). For information on the SSP scenarios, see the
special issue of the journal, Climate Change on Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways (Nakicenovic et al. 2013).
