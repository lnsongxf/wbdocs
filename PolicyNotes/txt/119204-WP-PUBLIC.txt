Executive Summary

The recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set an ambitious agenda of
providing universal access by 2030 to safely managed water supply and sanitation (WSS)
services. Policy makers and sector practitioners know that the SDGs will be achieved only
if service providers can provide better services at a lower cost. Yet, in the last decades,
policy approaches to structuring service delivery at the right level have been conflicting:
some countries have chosen to consolidate service provision centrally, hoping for greater
professionalism and economies of scale, whereas others have chosen to decentralize and
empower local governments in the hope that more local accountability would provide
strong incentives for good services.
  To reconcile those two apparently contrary trends, an increasing number of countries
and local governments are turning, with varying degrees of success, to the aggregation1
of local utility companies. Making utilities work together has been regarded as an
opportunity to improve the cost efficiency and performance of service providers, thus
making them more sustainable. There is ample empirical evidence in the literature on
the existence of economies of scale in the WSS industry, at least up to a certain level.
Furthermore, it seems that large utilities tend to operate at a lower unit cost and per-
form better than smaller ones. For instance, Abbot and Cohen (2009) found that signiﬁ-
cant economies of scale exist in the WSS industry. More recently, in a study analyzing
the performance of WSS utilities in Africa, Van Den Berg and Danilenko (2015) found
that size matters in achieving good performance. Two recent analyses based on IB-Net
data for utilities in the Danube region (Klien and Michaud 2016) and in the Latin
American and the Caribbean Region (Diaz and Flores 2015) showed lower unit costs for
larger utility companies. These studies compare utilities serving cities of different
sizes. It is not clear when the same scale effects are achieved by grouping a number of
noncontiguous providers into a single, larger, provider. Many utility companies and
countries embarking on such an aggregation processes have found that those benefits
do not always materialize in practice and that the accompanying processes are arduous
and fraught with political challenges.


A Global Study on the Aggregation of Water Supply and
Sanitation Utilities
This global study was initiated to provide evidence-based guidance to policy makers and
practitioners regarding when, why, and how water and sanitation utilities can work
together (“aggregate”) to successfully deliver specific policy outcomes, such as better ser-
vices or lower costs. This work does not advocate for or against aggregations but rather
presents and reviews global evidence, analyzes specific aggregation case studies, and
identifies the key characteristics that successful aggregations have in common,

                                  depending on their purpose and the context in which they occur. Acknowledging that it is
                                  challenging to make “before aggregation” and “after aggregation” cost comparisons because
                                  the levels of service are changing, this work focuses on proposing recommendations for
                                  successful aggregation, shaping lessons learned into a checklist of key questions to ask, and
                                  pointing out key decision points. The recommendations are based on evidence and observed
                                  experiences rather than theoretical considerations and sometimes run counter to conven-
                                  tional wisdom on aggregation practices.
                                    This study consists of a review of literature and an analysis of both qualitative and quanti-
                                  tative evidence—including a statistical analysis based on IB-Net data covering 1,306 utilities
                                  from more than 140 countries; a review of global aggregation trends, collecting data for
                                  111 countries; and 14 case studies from seven countries, providing a deep dive narrative of
                                  aggregation experiences.


                                  Aggregation Typology
                                  Expanding on the work done in World Bank (2005), this report postulates that the design of
                                  a successful aggregation should consider both the intended purpose and the context in
                                  which it takes place, and characterizes the design of an aggregation as a function of its scope,
                                  scale, process, and governance. This report defines a successful aggregation as one in which
                                  the aggregated service provider performs significantly better than the previously disaggre-
                                  gated entities with regard to the intended purpose, without unacceptable deterioration of
                                  other performance dimensions (figure ES.1).

                                  transaction costs (Coase 1993; Williamson 1975; figure ES.2). This being said, it is important to
                                  bear in mind that the outcome of a given aggregation should be measured primarily against its
                                  original purpose, which might or might not involve economic efficiency. In some cases, it might
                                  be necessary to accept a permanent transaction cost or change in cost structure in return for an
                                  important externality; for example, a cross-subsidy between low- and high-cost service areas or

                                  This study collected information on the provision and aggregation of water and sanitation
                                  services worldwide, from public sources (the Joint Monitoring Programme, the Organization
                                  for Economic Cooperation and Development, and World Bank databases) as well as a system-

                                  countries. The overview provides country-specific data such as urban and rural population
                                  sizes as well as aggregation-specific information such as the number of WSS utilities, the pop-

                                  aggregation reforms adopted at the national level, the number of aggregation processes over
                                  the preceding five years, and the predominant process, purpose, scale, and scope of aggrega-

                                  population and 51 percent of all countries. This review led to the following conclusions:

                                  •	 The level of decentralization of WSS services increases in countries with higher levels of
                                    development and overall service coverage.

                                  •	 Aggregation is a relatively recent trend mainly observed in African, European, and Latin
                                    American countries.

                                  •	 Aggregations are happening in a diversity of contexts but are more frequent in countries
                                    with high WSS services coverage.

      •	 The predominant aggregation type is a top-down, mandated process, targeted toward
        economic efficiency, encompassing all functions and services, following administrative
        boundaries, and taking the form of a merger.

      •	 Aggregations in countries with limited sector performance are predominantly aiming at
        improving services, whereas in countries where the coverage is high, economic efficiency
        is the main driver.


      When Do They Work? The Quantitative Evidence
      A statistical analysis was conducted of IB-Net data, which cover 1,306 utilities from more
      than 140 countries, to understand in greater detail the potential gains from aggregation.
      Comprehensive time-series data for 79 aggregation cases identified in the data set were used
      to understand the effect of aggregations on disaggregated performance measures as well as
      differences in cost structure. The analysis comprised two complementary approaches: first,
      an empirical assessment of the performance consequences of aggregations, and second, a
      cross-sectional analysis to understand how the configurations of utility structure, which are
      subject to change in the aggregation process, determine long-term performance differences.
      This part of the statistical analysis classified utilities according to core structural character-
      istics and compared the performance of utility types.
        The analysis of utility aggregations using IB-Net data shows that in some cases the reforms
      have led to both improved financial sustainability and performance, whereas in other cases
      the benefits did not materialize. The research also shows that most aggregations involve
      larger, urban utility companies taking over small, more rural towns, thus adding few cus-
      tomers and decreasing the density of the service area. In fact, utilities serving several towns
      do not see straightforward economies of scale when their size increases, unlike utilities
      serving a single town. In addition, the analysis of available empirical data found evidence
      that many aggregations do not generate lower labor unit costs per customer served in the
      way one would have expected given the potential economies of scale.
        The empirical analysis of IB-Net data also shows that the effect of aggregations varies
      widely and does not automatically show lower unit cost or better performance, because of
      the emergence of significant transaction costs in some cases. These results derive from
      before-and-after comparisons of utilities that aggregated with similar utilities that did not.
      Looking specifically at the post aggregation period, there is some evidence that managerial
      efficiency tends to improve through aggregation. Additional statistical tests show that some
      utility types might benefit more than others and that the design of the aggregation matters:

      •	 On the one hand, small, less complex aggregations and aggregations of utilities that
        already serve multiple towns are more likely to achieve cost savings.

      •	 On the other hand, aggregations that involve small or weak utilities tend to improve those
        utilities’ overall performance, rather than lowering their costs.

Why Do They Work? The Qualitative Evidence
To complement the hard data analysis, the study also investigated in greater detail 14 case
studies in seven countries, focusing on the stakeholders involved, the decisions made,
the roles of sector actors and their incentives, and the perceived outcomes, to highlight the
essence of each case experience. The seven countries were Brazil, Colombia, Hungary,
Indonesia, Portugal, Mozambique, and Romania. The selection of the countries and specific
providers ensured a diversity of geography, development level, size, and aggregation pro-
cess and scope. The availability of data was also a key selection criterion.
  Among other findings, this analysis provides evidence that many of the observed aggrega-
tions started from a low-cost and low-performance situation, going through a higher-cost
and higher-performance status before finally reaching the ideal high-performance and
lower-cost scenario. The overall “reform path” was to improve performance first, and only
secondarily to improve the cost situation.
  Analysis of the 14 case studies identified the following success factors:

•	 Having a stable champion throughout the aggregation often improves the likelihood of
  success.

•	 Building ownership and aligning the interests of stakeholders at all levels is essential.

•	 Defining principles but allowing flexibility in implementation ensures local ownership.

•	 Results take time; gradual improvement strategies with a consequent focus on results are
  particularly successful.

  The analysis also identified a series of risk factors that may prevent aggregation from
delivering its benefits:

•	 Not acknowledging context and purpose when designing an aggregation can lead to failure.

•	 When political leadership changes over time, aggregation can be jeopardized.

•	 Harmonization of administrative practices may level performance down and costs up.

•	 Transaction costs can hamper aggregation success.

•	 Cherry-picking practices can undermine the outcome of an aggregation whose purpose
  involves externalities such as cross-subsidies or capacity transfers.


How Does WSS Utility Aggregation Work? Concrete Insights
The qualitative and quantitative analysis allowed a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of set-
ting up a successful aggregated service provider, ranging from deciding on scale and scope,
to allocating power, to managing assets and liabilities and harmonizing IT systems. Building
on the aggregation typology—that is, the proposed four design dimensions of scope, scale,
process, and governance—the study highlights the trade-offs and potential challenges
associated with each of those design decisions.

      Scope of Aggregation
      The scope of aggregation varies among the case studies; however, in most, all functions have
      been aggregated. All stages of the service chain3 have been aggregated in all the case studies
      except for Águas de Alentejo (Portugal), which only supplies bulk water and oversees waste-
      water treatment. Water and wastewater services have been aggregated in eight case studies.
      In four case studies, aggregation was limited to water service only, and in one case study, the
      operator is in charge of WSS as well as waste collection. Those findings are consistent with
      the findings of the global aggregation trends review.

      Scale of Aggregation
      The scale of aggregation follows administrative boundaries in 12 case studies; in the two
      Brazilian cases, aggregation happened within watershed limits and concerns only rural
      areas. The population covered varies from 32,000 in the regional market of La Línea
      (Colombia) to 2.2 million in the regional market of Atlántico (Colombia). In Brazil, where
      aggregations happened in rural areas, the case studies cover 89,500 inhabitants in 153 settle-
      ments for SISAR (Sistema Integrado de Saneamento Rural) and 303,000 inhabitants in
      239 localities for COPANOR (COPASA Serviços de Saneamento Integrado do Norte e Nordeste
      de Minas Gerais), thus showing the low population density. In contrast, in Indonesia
      and Mozambique, where aggregations happened in urban areas, they exhibit high density
      (respectively 2.1 million inhabitants in seven cities for PDAM Tirtanadi and 400,000 in
      three cities for FIPAG Northern Unit). The number of towns covered in an aggregation varies
      widely among the case studies, ranging from 2 cities for PDAM Intan Banjar (Indonesia) to
      239 for COPANOR (Brazil).

      Process of Aggregation
      The government mandated the process of aggregation in 4 case studies, all in the European
      Union; in all others, it was voluntary. Of the 14 case studies, 6 received financial incentives
      from donors and 4 received financial support from public funds; 2 received both donor aid
      and public subsidies. These financial incentives or support, when provided effectively,
      enabled the funding of large investment projects, which acted as a “Big Push” to improve
      WSS coverage, quality, and performance.

      Governance of Aggregation
      In most case studies, the aggregated utilities have adopted a corporatized structure and used
      a delegated governance arrangement. Variety arises in the distribution of shares and power
      (for example, according to the asset value transferred to the aggregated entity or the volume
      or the population served per participating municipality). In most cases, asset transfer has
      offered an opportunity to set up or update inventories. Similarly, costs and revenues
          typically consolidated for the utility as a whole and tariffs harmonized across the operat-

                               conventional wisdom. This, in itself, is an important finding as it underlines the utility for
                               policy makers and practitioners of pausing and thinking about reforms before replicating a
                               model that might appear successful in a different context, for a different purpose.
                                 A few broad conclusions can be derived from the overall analysis:

                               1.	 Aggregation is a policy option, not a panacea for all sector challenges.

                               2.	 Aggregations come in many different shapes and forms, depending on the local circumstances.

        3.	 The design of a successful aggregation will depend on the intended purpose of the aggrega-
           tion, as well as on the overall context in which it takes place.

        4.	In the developing world, aggregation is primarily a means to deliver better services rather
           than to lower costs.

        5.	 Aggregation is a gradual, long-term process that requires strong stakeholder commitment.

        6.	Finally, aggregations are most successful when accompanied by a broader sector reform
           addressing governance, financing, and regulatory issues at the sector level.

          This study does not provide a definitive answer to the questions of when, why, and how
        aggregation can successfully deliver specific policy outcomes. Aggregation is a relatively
        recent phenomenon, and understanding the long-term impact of aggregation requires data
        over a longer time series. Similarly, the data sets do not allow a complete understanding of
        the transaction costs that emerge during aggregations, how they evolve over time, and how
        best to mitigate them. Utilities aggregate for a wide variety of purposes, and the available
        data primarily allow an understanding of the effectiveness of aggregations only with regard
        to cost savings and performance improvements. And of course, the case studies demon-
        strate time and again the importance of a favorable political economy and overall country
        environment for the success of the process; more work is necessary in that regard.
          Nevertheless, this study seeks to shed some light on the complexities and trade-offs asso-
        ciated with designing and implementing aggregation reforms, while providing relevant
        guidance on how to make such reforms as successful as possible. With that, the hope is that
        this work will enable policy makers and practitioners who are considering aggregation to
        better understand whether it is a relevant policy option for them, and to use the analysis
        and case studies to make more informed decisions about the design and implementation of
        the process.



            Complementing this report is an online toolkit that offers a broader set of references
            and resources to inform aggregation processes (www.worldbank.org/water/aggrega​
            tiontoolkit).




        Notes
        1.	 Aggregation is defined as the process by which two or more WSS service providers consolidate some or all their activities
           under a shared organizational structure, whether it implies physical infrastructure interconnection or not, and whether the
           original service providers continue to exist or not.

        2.	 Transaction costs refer not only to the singular event when the utilities are merged but also to additional cost in the
           aggregated utility, which may arise repeatedly. Therefore, transaction costs are defined here as comprising all costs except
           production cost and may be divided into one-offs and costs incurred repeatedly (Coase 1993; Williamson 1975).

        3.	 Aggregated utilities can supply only stages of water and wastewater services; that is, production, distribution, collection,
           or treatment (World Bank, 2005).

Chapter 1   Why This Report?
            Background
            The recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forward an ambitious
            agenda of providing universal access to good-quality water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            services within a financially constrained environment. Policy makers and sector practi-
            tioners know that the SDGs will be achieved only if service providers can provide better
            services at a lower cost. Yet, the last decades’ policy approaches to structuring service
            delivery at the right level have been conflicting: some countries have chosen to consoli-
            date service provision centrally, hoping for greater professionalism and economies of
            scale, whereas others have chosen to decentralize and empower local governments in the
            hope that more local accountability would provide strong incentives for good services.
              In an effort to reconcile those two apparently contrary trends, an increasing number
            of  countries and local governments are turning, with varying levels of success, to the
            aggregation1 of local utilities companies. Making utilities work together has been seen as
            an opportunity to improve the cost efficiency and performance of service providers, thus
            making them more sustainable. As a matter of fact, there is ample empirical evidence in
            the literature on the existence of economies of scale in the WSS industry, at least up to a
            certain level. Furthermore, it seems that large utilities tend to operate at a lower unit cost
            and perform better than smaller ones. For instance, Abbot and Cohen (2009) found that
            signiﬁcant economies of scale do exist in the WSS industry. More recently, in a study
            analyzing the performance of WSS utilities in Africa, Van Den Berg and Danilenko (2015)
            found that size matters in achieving good performance. Two recent analyses based on
            IB-Net data for utilities in the Danube region (Klien and Michaud 2016) and in the Latin
            American and the Caribbean Region (Diaz and Flores 2015) showed lower unit costs for
            larger utility companies. Yet, many utility companies and countries embarking on aggre-
            gation processes have found that those benefits do not always materialize in practice and
            that the accompanying processes are arduous and fraught with political challenges.


            This Report
            This report and the accompanying online toolkit aim to provide concrete, evidence-based
            guidance to policy makers and practitioners about when, why, and how water and sanitation
            utilities can work together (“aggregate”) to successfully deliver specific policy outcomes,
            such as better services or lower costs. The report highlights the various policy outcomes
            that can be expected from a successful aggregation, such as improved performance, lower
            costs, or solidarity between user categories. It underlines the trade-offs between those
            potential improvements. It also lays emphasis on the context in which aggregation pur-
            poses are most likely to be achieved, and how the purpose and the context must be taken
            into consideration when designing aggregations.

                                      This report does not advocate for or against aggregations; rather, it presents and reviews
                                    global evidence, analyzes specific aggregation case studies, and identifies the key character-
                                    istics that successful aggregation processes have in common. Those recommendations are
                                    based on actual evidence and observed experiences rather than theoretical considerations;
                                    and some put in question conventional wisdom with regard to aggregation practices.
                                      This report builds on previous work from the World Bank and others. In particular, it bor-
                                    rows significantly from the conceptual framework and practical typology proposed by the
                                    report, Models of Aggregation for Water and Sanitation Provision, Water Supply and Sanitation
                                    Working Notes (World Bank 2005). The report also considers a significant external literature
                                    concerned with the issue of economies of scale and the more limited set of publications
                                    dealing with actual aggregation processes and their varied successes (see box 4.3). A com-
                                    plete literature review is available in the online toolkit, which provides resources to support
                                    aggregation processes.

                                    This report builds on a review of literature and an analysis of both qualitative and quantitative
                                    evidence, a global data set of international trends, a utility performance database, and a series
                                    of case studies. The evidence-based materials encompass data and information collected for
                                    a wide range of countries all around the world, with various income levels (map 1.1).

A Review of International Aggregation Trends
The study collected information on the provision and aggregation of water and sanitation
services worldwide. The information was collected from public sources (such as the
Joint Monitoring Programme, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
and World Bank databases), as well as a systematic review of publicly available information
on the websites of national agencies in the various countries. The data and information were
subsequently validated internally by World Bank staff working in all regions. The overview
provides country-specific data such as urban and rural population sizes as well as aggrega-
tion-specific information covering items such as the number of WSS utilities, the population
served, the government level formally responsible for providing WSS services, aggregation
reforms adopted at the national level, the number of aggregation processes over the preced-
ing five years, and the predominant process, purpose, scale, and scope of the aggregation.
Information was collected on 111 countries, representing 88 percent of the world’s population

A statistical analysis based on IB-Net2 data, which cover 1,306 utilities from more than
140 countries, was conducted to understand in greater detail the potential gains from aggre-
gation. Comprehensive time-series data for 79 actual aggregation cases identified in the data
set were used to understand the effect of aggregations on disaggregated performance mea-
sures as well as differences in the cost structure. The statistical analysis comprised two com-
plementary approaches: first, an empirical assessment of the performance consequences of
aggregations, and second, a cross-sectional analysis. This replicated the regional analysis by
Klien and Michaud (2016) at the global level, using the full IB-Net database. Here the focus
was to compare how performance evolved for utilities that grew through aggregation versus
utilities that were not aggregated. The cross-sectional analysis, complementing the empiri-
cal assessment, aimed to understand how the different configurations of utility structure,
which are subject to change in the aggregation process, determine long-term performance
differences. This part of the statistical analysis classified utilities according to core structural
characteristics and compared the performance of the utility types. A detailed description of
the methodology of the statistical analysis is available in appendix B. A supporting paper is
also available in the online toolkit.


A Set of 14 Case Studies
To overcome the limitations of hard data analysis, the study also investigated in greater detail
a set of 14 case studies in seven countries, centering on the stakeholders involved, the deci-
sions made, the roles of sector actors and their incentives, and the perceived outcomes with
a view to bringing forward the essence of each case experience. The seven countries were
Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, Indonesia, Portugal, Mozambique, and Romania. The selection of
the countries and specific providers was done in a manner to ensure a diversity of geography,

    development levels, size, and aggregation process and scope. Availability of data was also a
    key selection criterion. The main characteristics of the selected case studies are presented in
    appendix A. A detailed narrative of each case study is also available in the online toolkit.

Chapter 2   Aggregations, Basic Concepts

            This chapter provides definitions of the basic concepts used in the rest of the report.
            It also outlines the typology used to understand and characterize aggregation processes,
            as well as evaluate their outcomes.


            Definition of Aggregation
            Definition
            In the context of this study, aggregation is defined as the process by which two or more
            WSS service providers consolidate some or all their activities under a shared organizational
            structure, whether it implies physical infrastructure interconnection or not, and whether
            the original service providers continue to exist or not (figures 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3).
              Aggregation, as defined in this report, can encompass a large variety of situations. A classic
            example is the full merger of several service providers into a new entity (figure 2.1).
              Aggregation also covers a number of other circumstances. For instance, several service
            providers can aggregate to build a common treatment plant facility or create a common
            WSS system (figure 2.2).
              Service providers can also choose to aggregate only specific functions, for example,
            operation and maintenance of their vehicles and heavy equipment machinery (figure 2.3).
              For this study, service providers that cooperate on an ad hoc basis and do not share or
            set up a common organizational structure are not considered as aggregating. Likewise,
            this study defines aggregation as a process rather than a situation, meaning that ser-
            vice providers that were established at a specific level from the beginning (for example,
            the national utility companies established in some Western African countries) are also not
            considered aggregated.

            Fragmentation of Service Provision and Aggregation Index
            To measure the degree of fragmentation of service provision of the water sector in a coun-
            try, we take into account the fact that WSS services are usually considered as local ser-
            vices and propose a simple normalized index based on the number of local governments
            and the number of service providers.

                                                            U /M
                                                   A=1−
                                                          (U /M ) + 1

              Where
              U	 is the number of service providers in the country
              M	 is the number of local governments in the country
              A	is a normalized aggregation index ranging from 0 to 100, with a value of 0 indicating
                  a fully atomized sector with many more utility companies than local governments,
                  a value of 50 indicating the same number of utilities and local governments, and a
                  value of 100 indicating a single national utility.

Typology
Policy makers usually pursue a
specific purpose or set of purposes
when they decide to promote
aggregation. When they conduct
the aggregation process, they con-
sider the enabling and physical
environments in which it is being
conducted. Therefore, this report
postulates that the purpose and
                                          FIGURE 2.2.   Aggregation Example—Aggregation of All Functions and Some Stages
context both influence the design
of the aggregation process and that
the design of the aggregation
can  be characterized by its scope,
scale,   process,    and   governance
(figure 2.4). The typology is used
consistently throughout the report.


Context and Purpose of
Aggregations

Context of Aggregation
The context in which aggregations
take place is characterized by the
enabling environment in the coun-         FIGURE 2.3.   Aggregation Example—Aggregation of Some Functions for All Stages
try and in the sector. This enabling
environment         comprises   factors
such as the level of development
and of income, the  water-related
environmental standards in force,
the political will and leadership at
both national and local levels, the
institutional setup of the water sec-
tor with regard to WSS p
                       ­ rovision,
policy-making responsibilities,
regulation, and so on. The context

                                                                     encompasses the size of utilities, their level of performance,
                                                                     the population they serve, the number of towns in their
                                                                     operating area, the quality and quantity of water resources,
                                                                     and other factors. As discussed in  subsequent chapters,
                                                                     policy makers should carefully consider context because it
                                                                     influences the design of reforms.


                                                                     Purpose of Aggregation
                                                                     Aggregations can be distinguished by their purpose
                                                                     (see  figure 2.2). Not all aggregations are pursued for the
                                                                     same purpose; in fact, the study shows that the purposes
                                                                     that decision makers pursue differ significantly from one
                                                                     case to another. The main ones include the following:

                               •	 Economic efficiency, which seeks lower unit costs, through econo-
                                                                                                                    Internalities
                                 mies  of scale or economies of scope or more effective investment
                                 strategies

                               •	 Performance1 improvement, which covers technical and managerial
                                 aspects of service quality and considers customer satisfaction

                               •	 Professionalization, which targets technical capacity enhancement and
                                 addresses bottlenecks caused by scarcity of human capital

                               •	 Environmental benefits, seeking integrated water resources manage-
                                 ment by sharing sources or reducing pollution
                                                                                                                   Externalities
                               •	 Solidarity, to cross-subsidize investments between regions or social
                                 groups so as to extend coverage and/or recover operation and
                                 maintenance costs

                                 Aggregation is thus sometimes motivated by (mostly local) stakeholders seeking to
                               generate positive internalities and sometimes by external or national stakeholders seeking
                               to generate positive externalities.

                               •	 Economic efficiency is likely to generate positive internalities for a utility as reducing oper-
                                 ating expenditures (OPEX) can allow the reallocation of some resources to investments to
                                 improve asset management and sustainability.

                               •	 Performance improvement and professionalization are likely to generate internalities but
                                 also  externalities. For instance, improved water service continuity, reduced sewerage
                                 blockages, improved drinking-water quality, and improved wastewater treatment quality
                                 generate in  customers a higher willingness to pay, thus improving the invoice collec-
                                 tion  ratio. The  utility is able to collect more revenues, improving its sustainability.

       Performance improvement also generates economic and social externalities, as it improves
       health conditions for the connected population, reduces pollution discharged in the envi-
       ronment, and increases water availability for economic activities.

     •	 Aggregation aiming at environmental benefits or solidarity generates economic, social, and
       environmental externalities. Extension of coverage brings better health conditions and
       greater water availability for economic activities.

       Often, decision makers pursue more than one purpose; however, the combination of
     different purposes may not always be possible. Aggregation that targets quality and tech-
     nical capacity improvement often induces large investment programs, which tend to
     increase OPEX. Thus, enhancing economic efficiency and performance at the same time
     may sometimes be contradictory, especially when a utility is trapped in a low-level equi-
     librium (box 2.1). As will be discussed in subsequent chapters, the design of the aggrega-
     tion with regard to scope, scale, process, and governance should depend closely on the
     purpose sought (figure 2.5).




            BOX 2.1.   Low-Level Equilibrium Concept and the Big Push


            As described by Savedoff and Spiller (1999), the WSS water sector in many develop-
            ing countries is stuck in a low-level equilibrium. In such situations, low tariffs are
            associated with low quality, low service expansion, and general operational ineffi-
            ciency. The term “equilibrium” indicates that without a reform of the sector’s setup,
            there is no movement toward improved water services.

            This phenomenon originates in incentives for governments to behave opportunisti-
            cally. By lowering tariffs or resisting tariff increases, they can reap short-term political
            benefits such as electoral gains, so they will support the status quo over costly
            political actions that might involve higher water rates in the short run and yield
            diffuse benefits in the longer term. Moreover, in such circumstances consumers are
            relatively dispersed and too disorganized to assume an active role in holding the
            water authority accountable. They also are unwilling to spend more on bad-quality
            services that they see as wastefully managed. In turn, this creates incentives for
            water companies to operate inefficiently regardless of whether they are public or
            private companies (figure B2.1.1).

            To get out of the low-level equilibrium, policy makers can implement various
            strategies, such as improving the regulatory environment or limiting government
            opportunism. Following the low-level equilibrium trap theory developed by Nelson
            (1956), large investment programs can act as a “Big Push” that enables underdevel-
            oped sectors to get out of the trap and embark on a development path.
                                                                                box continues next page

                                  assistance stemming from national or supranational stakeholders.

                                •	 It can be voluntary, deriving only from a bottom-up initiative, stemming from utilities or
                                  local actors without a national framework to encourage it.

                                  These processes form a continuum from bottom-up to top-down processes. Moreover,
                                supranational and national incentives can be aligned to generate better results. For example,
                                national actors can produce national policy guidance stating that aggregation is an eligibility
                                criterion for external or national funding.
                                  The first three categories represent cases in which the national government is actively pro-
                                moting aggregation processes, while the fourth is characteristic of environments where the
                                national government has no specific policy views on aggregation processes, which then
                                happen from the bottom up, driven by utility companies or local actors’ own interests.

                                Governance of Aggregation
                                When aggregating utilities, various governance aspects have to be dealt with. The main ones
                                relate to institutional elements; financing, assets, and liabilities; and harmonization of
                                processes and practices.

                                Institutional elements

                                •	 Legal form and organization: Service providers have to define and agree on the legal and
                                  institutional structure of the aggregated utility. Three broad categories of aggregation
                                  arrangements have been identified (figure 2.11):

                                  •	 A special-purpose vehicle—that is, a specific cooperation agreement between service
                                     providers who remain separate entities, with a well-defined scope (for example,
                                     managing a specific facility)

                                  •	 A delegated contract signed between the jurisdiction level in charge of service delivery
                                     and a private or public operator, transferring all or most of the operational responsibili-
                                     ties, but maintaining the original entities

                                  •	 A merger, by which original service providers consolidate into a single entity and
                                     disappear

                                    •	 Role of citizens and customers: Communication and information flows between the
                                      aggregated utility and customers can be materialized in formal accountability measures
                                      and mechanisms.

                                    •	 Exit and entry clauses: Clear entry and exit rules on joining or leaving the aggregation have
                                      to be set. They commonly include an asset inventory as most exit clauses anticipate the
                                      repayment of depreciation costs when investments have been made.


                                    Financing, Assets, and Liabilities

                                    •	 Cost- and revenue-sharing agreements: Rules on sharing costs and revenues must be clearly
                                      established among aggregating entities. They vary according to the degree of integration
                                      of service providers.

                                    •	 Asset ownership, transfer, development, and management (royalties, investment decisions, and
                                      so on): Assets transferred to the aggregated entity should be inventoried. This transfer may be
                                      remunerated. Rules regarding investment allocation and priorities must be clearly set out.

Def﻿﻿﻿﻿ining and Understanding a Successful Aggregation
What does Success Look Like?
To analyze the evidence, it is important to first define a successful aggregation process.
The degree of success should be assessed and measured against the main purpose(s) of the
aggregation. This report defines a successful aggregation as one in which the aggregated ser-
vice provider performs significantly better than the previously disaggregated entities with
regard to the intended purpose, without unreasonable deterioration of other performance
dimensions. For example, if the aggregation purpose is to improve economic efficiency by
achieving economies of scale (and/or scope), the aggregation process will be successful if the
new, aggregated structure achieves significantly lower unit costs without unreasonable2
deterioration in other dimensions such as solidarity or service quality.


Why Does Success Not Always Materialize?
There can be many reasons why an aggregation is not successful. Despite the purely tech-
nical arguments for economies of scale, aggregation does have possible drawbacks, such
as loss in accountability and political reluctance that may hamper the process of aggrega-
tion, blocking it before it takes off or damaging it after it is launched. Clustering service
areas increases the distance between the service provider and the end user. Salaries of
the agglomerated unit might be adjusted to reflect those of the highest-paying utility,
which increases operating costs without necessarily creating equivalent efficiency gains.
Lack of political will in aggregation reforms can arise if local authorities perceive such
reforms as a threat to their sovereignty. Aggregations also make utility organizations
more complex because the numbers of systems, employees, and processes can increase
substantially. In addition, utility ownership—in the sense of the allocation of decision
and control rights—tends to become more complex. Instead of a single owner, several
municipalities or regional entities share ownership or sign a lease agreement with a
utility. Such fragmentation of control and decision rights can entail significant transac-
tion costs.
  In summary, although serving a larger number of customers has organizational advan-
tages in the production process for utilities—which can materialize as economies of scale in
lower unit costs or improved performance—greater size also implies higher transaction costs
(Coase 1993) (Williamson 1975). Moreover, the concept of transaction cost implies that utili-
ties of different size represent trade-offs between production and transaction costs. Whereas
production costs typically fall with size, transaction costs tend to increase. The optimal
degree of aggregation is then the point where the sum of production and transaction costs is
minimized (figure 2.12). The optimal size, however, depends on the context and therefore
varies across a country and over time. Indeed the context will influence the level of produc-
tion (through the quality and quantity of water resources, for instance) and transaction costs
(through the size and performance of aggregating utilities, for instance) and, as such, will
have to be taken into account to ensure aggregation success.

                                                                   efore aggregation, research and information costs incurred to find

                                                         Size    In the context of this study, the entire design phase of the aggre-

                                  •	 During aggregation, bargaining costs corresponding to the negotiations necessary to reach
                                    an agreement among

                                    described in the list about governance earlier. This might lead, in concrete terms, to sub-
                                    optimal solutions, such as the commitment to take over unnecessary staff or liabilities to
                                    make the bargain more palatable to the various parties.

                                  •	 After aggregation, enforcement costs corresponding to the costs necessary to implement
                                    aggregation and make sure that all aggregating parties comply with their commitment and
                                    duties. They could, for example, entail the harmonization of salaries to a higher level or
                                    the costs of setting up new systems and procedures.



                                  Long-Term Transaction Costs (Consequences of the Aggregation)

                                  Several long-term transaction costs can be distinguished (Canback 2003) and applied to
                                  aggregation situations:

                                  •	 Bureaucratic insularity: As utilities grow, senior managers are less accountable to the lower
                                    ranks of the organization and to shareholders. Particularly in large utilities with well-­
                                    established procedures and rules, individual rent seeking is possible. This relates also to
                                    the frequent finding that managers in large organizations tend to emphasize size over
                                    profitability.

                                  •	 Motivational aspects ("atmospheric consequences"): Increasing size brings increasing spe-
                                    cialization, which in turn leads to reduced commitment from employees. Employees in
                                    large organizations often have a hard time understanding the purpose of corporate activi-
                                    ties, as well as their individual contribution.

                                  •	 Communication distortion due to bounded rationality3: As utilities grow, complexity
                                    increases. Hierarchical layers are added to manage the increasing complexity. Inevitably,
                                    these layers distort the flow of information. This limits the information available to exec-
                                    utives, which Williamson (1975) called a loss of control.

                                    In addition to such “classic” diseconomies of scale, which can arise as a single utility
                                  grows, aggregations add complexity to the organizational structure, thereby adding to

transaction costs. Among the most important characteristics that change through
consolidation:

•	 Dealing with fragmentation of ownership: The fact that an aggregated utility serves several
   municipalities requires the formulation of decision rules for the shareholders and the
   allocation of voting power. Various schemes for the distribution of voting rights are possi-
   ble, but in all cases the distribution requires additional bureaucratic procedures and
   mechanisms to deal with multiple instead of single owners.

•	 Heterogeneous initial conditions and heterogeneous preferences: Municipalities for which
   service is bundled through an aggregation might have widely varying initial performance,
   service quality, and states of infrastructure. This raises questions about whether to apply
   the same policies to all utilities and how to prioritize investments and service improve-
   ments. To some extent, local preferences with respect to service provision may differ.
   How the management of the aggregated utility responds to these challenges might vary
   from case to case, but the utility needs conflict resolution mechanisms to align interests
   and arbitrate between those that diverge. This adds again to organizational complexity
   and decision-making costs.

•	 Complicated cost- and revenue-sharing mechanisms: As more municipalities are involved in
   an aggregation, possibly complicated cost- and revenue-sharing systems must be set up
   and adapted over time. Apart from the administrative burden, such a system also reduces
   transparency between service delivery and the price paid for the service, particularly
   if  cross-subsidization between municipalities is pursued. Cost-sharing mechanisms give
   each municipality an incentive to attract as much investment and expenditure (public
   work contracts) as possible, regardless of whether or not the investment is sensible. These
   so-called common pool problems become more pronounced, the larger and more compli-
   cated the cost-sharing mechanisms are.

  All in all, it is important to measure the outcome of a given aggregation primarily against
its original purpose, which may or may not involve economic efficiency. In some cases,
it  might be necessary to accept a permanent transaction cost in return for an important
externality; for example, a cross-subsidy between low- and high-cost service areas or an
environmental benefit.


Notes
1.	 For the purpose of this study, the performance of a WSS utility is defined as its ability to provide cost-effective, good-quality
   service to the population in its service area. It is measured through an aggregate Water Utility Performance Index (WUPI)
   measuring three distinct dimensions—the coverage, quality, and efficiency of services provided. For more details, refer to
   box 4.1.

2.	 As discussed further in later sections, some level of deterioration might be unavoidable when externalities are involved;
   for example, the improvement of service quality might involve increases in costs.

3.	 Bounded rationality conveys the idea that individuals have a limited rationality when making choices.

Chapter 3   What are Global Aggregation Trends?

            This chapter presents the main findings of the review of international aggregation trends,
            which was conducted by collecting data and information for 111 countries around
            the  world (table 3.1), exhibiting a diversity of income levels (table 3.2) and covering
            88 percent of the world’s population (map 3.1). Information was collected exclusively
            from publicly available sources (international databases such as the World Bank World
            Development Indicators and the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme), regional
            and sector databases such as those of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
            Development or a regional study on countries in the Danube region (World Bank 2015),
            and national publications and websites. All data were validated by Bank staff and are
            available in the online toolkit.

      countries with higher levels                 coverage, the trend is clear (figure 3.1): The lower the water coverage, the higher the level of
      of development and overall                   the jurisdiction in charge of service provision. For example, for 50 percent of countries that

                                                Where, When, and How Aggregations Happened

                                                (bottom-up). Countries in which no aggregation reform is in place and where bottom-up

                                                  Among all countries in the global data set, aggregation happened in 35 (32 percent). In

   recent trend, observed in                    place or in progress; 79 percent of these reforms were passed during the past 15 years
   African, European, and Latin                 (figure 3.4). As such, aggregation appears to be a relatively recent trend; only a few
   American countries.                          reforms were conducted before the end of the 20th century. Indeed, the decades before
                                                2000 were characterized by a strong decentralization trend in the water sector.

Chapter 4   When Do They Work? The Quantitative
            Evidence

            This section presents the empirical evidence from a quantitative analysis of the full
            IB-Net data set, consisting of an identification of aggregation cases occurring within the
            data set and a comparison of the performance of those aggregated utility companies with
            similar, non-aggregated utility companies. The analysis presented in this report focuses
            on the most robust and relevant results; a much more extensive supporting paper with
            detailed results and robustness analysis is available in the toolkit.
              Although IB-Net covers several thousand utilities all over the globe, the number of
            aggregations1 in the database is substantially lower. After cleaning the data and restricting
            the analysis to utilities suitable for an evaluation, 79 aggregation cases remained. Most of
            those cases occurred in Europe or Central Asia (table 4.1). Although IB-Net is not repre-
            sentative in terms of country coverage, the database suggests that most of the aggrega-
            tion reforms occurred in Central and Eastern Europe, and to some extent in South America
            and Central Asia, which is consistent with the findings of chapter 3. Virtually all aggrega-
            tions occurred between 2000 and 2010, with a scant few before and after these dates.2
              In the IB-Net data set, the following countries had the most aggregation cases: Romania
            (15), Poland (12), Hungary (6), Kazakhstan (7), Serbia (5), the former Yugoslav Republic of
            Macedonia (4), and the Czech Republic (4). It should be noted, however, that although the
            bulk of the cases is located in these 7 countries, cases of aggregations from 25 countries
            fed into the analysis.
              Related to the country distribution, most aggregations occur in upper-middle-income
            and high-income countries (table 4.2). There are also some cases in lower-middle-income
            countries, but none from low-income countries.
              The quantitative analysis is limited to the data and information available in IB-Net
            and therefore focuses on the outcome of aggregation processes in terms of economic
            efficiency and performance improvements; owing to data limitations, the impacts
            on externalities such as solidarity and the environment are therefore excluded.
            Likewise, the data set does not allow an in-depth investigation of the influence of

         BOX 4.1.     Utility Performance and Water Utility Performance Index


         Consideration of multiple performance measures is important in light of the various
         purposes an aggregation can pursue (see chapter 2). Apart from performance on the
         input side, which this report measures as unit cost, performance can also be measured on
         the output or outcome side. To this end, this study uses the Water Utility Performance
         Index (WUPI)—developed in a study for water utilities in the Danube region—and its
         subcomponents. Starting from 10 key performance indicators, the study constructed
         3 distinct outcome indicators:


         •	 Coverage is basically an indicator of the share of population connected to water and
             wastewater services, and the extent of wastewater treatment. Higher values indicate a
             higher share of population connected and a higher extent of wastewater treatment.

         •	 Quality of service represents the performance of a utility in terms of the number of
             hours of service as well as the frequency of sewerage blockages. Higher values indicate
             more hours of service and fewer blockages.

         •	 Management efficiency seeks to measure managerial efficiency. It is based on a number of
             subindicators such as staffing efficiency, cost recovery, share of metered connections,
             revenue collection, and non-revenue water. Higher values indicate higher cost recovery
             and recovery collection, more metered connections, lower staffing, and lower non-­
                                                                                              revenue
             water.

         The details of the calculations of WUPI, such as the measurement of the subindicators
         used, appear in appendix B.




     utility governance or aggregation process design on overall outcome. Those issues are
     investigated in detail in chapter 5, on the basis of qualitative case studies. Here the
     focus is on a general appraisal of whether aggregations generated the expected cost
     savings or performance improvements.
       For utility performance, this chapter uses a set of quantitative indicators to capture the
     various purposes of aggregations. Most important are coverage, quality of service, and
     management efficiency. In addition, these subindicators are used as an aggregate in the
     ­
     form  of a composite performance indicator (WUPI) (box 4.1). It should again be noted,


32   Joining Forces for Better Services?
however, that although these indicators capture some important aggregation purposes,
goals in other dimensions are beyond the analysis of this chapter.
  A key insight is that aggregations are not only a story of economies of scale. Although the
data confirm that large utilities tend to have lower unit costs and better performance than
small utilities, whether improvements materialize during an aggregation process depends
on the aggregation design. Moreover, many of the aggregation cases in IB-Net exhibit fea-
tures—for example, an increasing rather than decreasing share of labor costs—that are detri-
mental to performance improvements. Bearing in mind the trade-off between production
and transaction costs outlined in chapter 2, such a finding is hardly a surprise and is consis-
tent with earlier literature (see chapter 2). This chapter shows that aggregation success
should not be taken for granted and that the process should be designed bearing in mind the
participating utilities’ starting point and intended purpose.


Bigger is Generally Better…
Utilities that distribute a larger volume of water have, on average, lower unit costs than util-
ities that produce a smaller volume. This empirical relationship appears to hold in water
industries around the globe and is one of the main arguments in favor of utility aggregations.
The expectation of unit and common cost savings from utility mergers has been supported
by a large number of economic studies since the late 1960s, arguing that the water sector is
characterized by important economies of scale (box 4.2). Unit cost should fall with increas-
ing output over substantial parts of the output range.
  In recent years, a number of survey articles have tried to take stock of what is known from
associated research (see González-Gómez and Garcia-Rubio 2008; Abbot and Cohen 2009;
Walter 2009; Ferro, Lentini and Mercardier 2011; Carvalho, Cunha Marques and Berg 2012;
and Saal and al. 2013). This study’s reading of these surveys is that the industry has import-
ant economies of scale that are nonetheless not unlimited. The evidence appears to be partic-
ularly strong in the case of small companies and medium-sized companies, and much less so
                                                                     ­ xcessive size might
for large companies. The United Kingdom is given as an example where e
have had negative effects on productivity (González-Gómez and Garcia-Rubio 2008). All six
reviews share the view that economies of scale decrease with increasing utility size and even-
tually turn into diseconomies of scale. The studies also note that the estimated optimal



    BOX 4.2.   Definition of Economies of Scale


    Economies of scale exist if long-run unit costs decrease with output increases. Applied
    to the water sector, this means that the cost per cubic meter of water decreases while
    water production increases. Empirical studies on the WSS industry note that economies
    of scale are prevalent in small providers, while diseconomies of scale start appearing in
    very big ones.

                                                                                                       connections varies from 100,000 in Fraquelli
                                                          Cohen (2009) note that the optimal number of ­

                                                          cubic meter of water. Consequently, the surveys tend to conclude that consolidations are
                                                          beneficial, at least for moderately large utilities. González-Gómez and García-Rubio (2008)
                                                          give a nuanced account of the existence of economies of scale by also stressing the role of the
                                                          overall production environment. According to them, the relevance of customer density and
                                                          regional dispersion is illustrated in a number of studies. Small-density mergers and large geo-
                                                          graphical service areas might reduce the profitability of a consolidation considerably.
                                                            Also in the utility data analyzed in IB-Net, it can be shown that larger utilities have
                                                          lower unit costs and higher performance than smaller utilities. As shown in the left panel
                                                             figure 4.1, with increasing size, as measured by the number of customers, the unit cost

                                                          relationships do not, however, imply that merging utilities universally results in lower
                                                          unit costs and better performance, as discussed in the next section.

               Utilities serving several                      scale relationship holds: unit costs tend to decrease with greater numbers of customers
               towns do not see a                             (see figure 4.1). Although the steepness of the relationship varies, this result is found consis-

                                                                  In contrast, the cost-to-output relationship is more complicated and sometimes even
               increases.
                                                              increases for utilities that serve more than one town (figure 4.2, contrasted with figure 4.1).
                                                              The cost-customer relationship is not only flatter but also exhibits a larger variation than for
                                                              utilities that serve a single town. The possible cost savings of increasing the number of cus-

                                                              uncertain and more limited than those of a single municipality that grows its customer base.
                                                              Similar results can be found for performance in utilities serving several towns. Although
                                                              larger utilities still tend to exhibit higher performance, the line is again flatter and exhibits
                                                              larger variation.
                                                                  Furthermore, the argument that aggregations differ from simple economies of scale can
                                                              be emphasized by looking at the relationship between unit cost and the number of towns
                                                              served. The left panel of figure 4.3 shows that when customers are controlled for, unit costs
                                                              increase as the number of systems served increases, clearly demonstrating the impact of the
                                                              transaction costs described in chapter 2. At the same time, the right panel of the same figure
                                                              shows that performance does improve, confirming that aggregation can be a meaningful

                                                              from managing more or fewer customers. Consequently, whether a given aggregation pro-

                                                             Utilities serving multiple towns face a more uncertain evolution of cost as customers are
                                                           added. Thus, the analyzed aggregations observed in IB-Net are unlikely to yield cost savings
   Most aggregations involve
   larger, urban utility companies                         simply because they add relatively few additional customers. As shown in figure 4.4, aggre-

   towns, and therefore tend to                            population. As the many horizontal arrows in the graph indicate, the change in the number

                                                           through economies of scale, utilities would have to move along the downward-sloping cost
                                                           function, as shown in figure 4.1, which would imply a more vertical movement of utilities in
                                                           figure 4.4. This is clearly rather the exception than the rule: the aggregations have added
                                                           only a few customers.
                                                             Most aggregations observed in IB-Net also decrease utility network density, which is mea-
                                                           sured as the number of customers by kilometer of water and sewerage network. As figure 4.5
                                                           shows, the length of the network increases at a faster pace than the number of customers,
                                                           leading to a decrease in density in most aggregations. This is consistent with the previous
                                                           finding of aggregations consisting mostly of larger, dense urban utilities taking over more
                                                           dispersed, small utilities. This finding is consistent with a number of previous studies sug-
                                                           gesting that density losses prohibit economies of scale (box 4.3).
                                                             Another issue that calls into question the potential cost savings through aggregation is the

   Utilities going through                                 evolution of the cost structure. One of the main differences between smaller and larger util-
   aggregation do not see                                  ities is the share of labor costs, with the latter having lower costs on average. Although wages
   decreases in the cost of labor, a                       tend to be higher in larger utilities, the labor cost per customer is considerably lower. This
   key expenditure and expected                            suggests that some of the cost advantage from larger utilities is due to lower labor unit costs,
   area of economies of scale.
                                                           especially a smaller number of employees per connection (for more details, see box 4.4).

         BOX 4.3. Empirical Evidence From High-Income Countries: Aggregations in the
         Netherlands and Japan


         Among the few quantitative studies of water utility aggregation that analyze utility
         performance before and after such reforms are De Witte and Dijkgraaf (2010) for
         the Netherlands and Urakami and Parker (2011) for Japan. In contrast to many static
         comparisons of large and small utilities, the conclusions from these two aggregation
         studies are much less favorable toward utility mergers.

         The first study is an ex post evaluation of the benchmarking system introduced and the
         utility consolidations that occurred after 1997 in the Netherlands. The Dutch case is
         interesting, as the sector was already highly concentrated before the reforms: the sample
         period from 1992 to 2007 saw a further decrease in the number of utilities, from 20 to 10.
         Water utilities had an average production of 69 million cubic meters (m3). As a result
         of the aggregations, this amount increased to 111 million m3 on average. De Witte and
         Dijkgraaf’s appraisal of the reforms is ambiguous. The overall results were very mixed,
         depending on the methodology, but no estimation showed a positive and significant
         effect on scale efficiency. In a few cases, they even found higher average costs after the
         aggregations. Similar to the study of the United Kingdom (Saal, Parker, and Weyman-
         Jones 2007), this paper questions the benefits of mergers in sectors where the utilities are
         already large.

         The consolidation study by Urakami and Parker differs from the previous one in several
         respects. First, it has a large sample of several hundreds of aggregating utilities. The
         sample covers Japanese water utilities from 1999 to 2006, which saw a large-scale
         aggregation from 1,958 to 1,602 units. Second, in Japan—unlike in the United Kingdom or
         the Netherlands—water supply is much more fragmented with a large number of utilities of
         varying size. It might therefore give a broader account of aggregation effects, considering
         also small-scale units. Their findings suggest that aggregations did indeed reduce utility
         costs. Although the effect is statistically significant, it is very small, with aggregated
         utilities being 1.8 percent more productive. Regarding economies of scale, the study
         finds that on average, both aggregated and non-aggregated utilities are still operating at
         economies of scale. The authors conclude that benefits from aggregation may not have
         materialized more clearly because at least some of the mergers involved rural utilities with
         low density.

         These two studies show that the context and design of aggregation may matter a lot,
         similar to the argument made in chapter 2. Two dimensions appear critical. A utility may
         already be too large, and its operation may be characterized by diseconomies of scale. The
         Dutch case stressed this fact. Regardless of initial size, the Japanese case illustrated that
         aggregations may be detrimental to cost efficiency if they absorb low-density systems.
         Particularly large urban utilities might lose economies of density through such mergers.

     BOX 4.4. Structure of Operational Expenditure for Small, Medium, and Large Utility
     Companies


     To understand the cost differences between small and large utilities—and therefore als
     the source of possible efficiency gains through mergers—it is clear that differences in
     cost structure may play an important role. To analyze this relationship, the left panel
     of figure B4.1.1 displays the costs shares for (i) labor, (ii) energy, and (iii) other cost for
     utilities of small (<2.4 million m3), medium (>2.4 million m3 and <13 million m3), and large
     (>13 million m3) size as measured by volume. Despite the considerable variation in each
     group—for example, each group contains utilities that have very high as well as very low
     labor cost shares—a few striking patterns emerge.

     Cost shares and absolute costs spent on labor decrease from small to medium utilities
     and further to large utilities. Larger utilities spend a lower proportion on labor. A similar
     pattern applies for energy costs, which also decrease when moving from small to medium
     to large utilities. The converse holds for other costs (for example, consulting costs or costs
     of various procured goods), which tend to increase in both relative and absolute terms
     with increasing utility size.

     The hypothesis that larger utilities spend less on labor and energy not only as a share of
     expenses but also in absolute values is confirmed by the right panel in figure B4.1.1, where
     moving from small to medium and large utilities, it is clear that the cost of labor and the
     cost of energy per cubic meter are falling. In contrast to labor and energy, the component
     for “other cost,” as shown in the right panel of figure B4.1.1, does not appear to decrease
     with volume (cubic meters). If anything, the clusters with larger and denser utilities exhibit
     higher costs per cubic meter.

     Taken together, the results suggest that growth in utility size is related to lower labor
     cost and lower energy cost—both in cost shares and in absolute terms. For other cost
     components, rather the opposite relation seems to apply. Economies of scale, if any,
     therefore seem to originate from labor and energy costs, whereas other costs might even
     increase with volume and density.

                                  that did not. Looking specifically at the postaggregation period, there is some evidence that
                                  managerial efficiency tends to improve through aggregation. This finding closely corre-
                                  sponds to the reported professionalization that is present in many case studies.
                                    There are two potential explanations for the apparently very limited systematic results.
                                  First, aggregations have widely varying purposes. This leads to different processes and
                                  aggregation designs, resulting in very different outcomes. Second, some aggregations were
                                  more successful than others because the initial context and designs were very different.
                                  Additional statistical tests show that some utility types might benefit more than others and
                                  that the design of the aggregation matters.3
                                    Regarding the physical context before the process, aggregations that add only a small
Limited, less complex             number of towns seem to be able to achieve cost savings compared with aggregations that
aggregations, and aggregations    involve a large number of towns, such as large-scale regionalization schemes. This finding
of utilities that are already     could suggest that organizational complexity and transaction costs are limited in aggrega-
serving multiple towns, are
                                  tions involving only a few towns and do not outweigh the economies of scale achieved
more likely to achieve cost
                                  through the aggregation. Conversely, merging a large number of previously independent
savings.
                                  utilities in a single step seems more challenging and prevents performance improvements
                                  and cost savings.
                                    In the IB-Net data set, such low complexity, cost-effective aggregations are very dispersed
                                  across countries and time. This might be because those aggregations occur voluntarily, in a
                                  bottom-up fashion, rather than through a countrywide aggregation strategy. Although this
                                  finding is not evidence against large-scale regionalization, cost savings are more likely in
                                  small-scale ones.
                                    The other type of utility that seems able to achieve cost savings through aggregations are
                                  those that are already serving a large number of towns before the aggregation process
                                  starts. Conversely, utilities that previously served a single municipality do not reduce unit
                                  costs when adding towns to serve. This complements the findings in Klien and Michaud
                                  (2016) showing that (large) utilities serving a single municipality are the most cost-effec-
                                  tive utilities. Although the data in IB-Net do not permit an analysis of the mechanism
                                  responsible for this finding, a likely explanation is that an organizational structure that is
                                  already designed to serve several towns can more easily integrate additional systems with-
                                  out any detrimental effects.
                                    Cases of this type of aggregation can be found in Hungary between 1995 and 2005.
                                  Poland also experienced a number of such aggregations during the 2000s. More recently,
                                  aggregations of this type have occurred in Serbia and in Mexico.

         BOX 4.5. Aggregation Success Path: Starting from Low Cost–Low Performance,
         Going through Higher Cost–Higher Performance, to Reach High Performance–
         Lower Cost


         Evidence that many of the observed aggregations primarily helped improve performance
         rather than lower cost also appears in the case studies. To describe this pattern, a graphical
         representation of the starting point (yellow dot) and the aggregation outcome (blue
         dot) is proposed. As shown in figure B4.5.1, the overall “reform path” was to improve
         performance first and only secondarily to improve the cost situation. For all case studies
         starting from a low performance level, aggregation was an opportunity to benefit from
         a Big Push, through incentivized investment plans that had financial support from
         national authorities or external partners. This helped them move toward a higher level
         of performance and capacity, thus escaping the low-level equilibrium trap. However,
         this quality improvement was achieved through higher costs. The only exception is the
         Mozambique case study of Nampula, which planned a major investment required for water
         source augmentation that never materialized. It appears to be stuck in the low-level
         equilibrium trap. In Hungary, it appears that the two utilities started from a relatively high
         performance level, albeit at higher cost. As overall performance was not the main issue
         there, the aggregations enabled them to generate economic efficiency gains.

aggregations by improving quality rather than by reducing costs. This is consistent with the
view of aggregations as a reform option to enable utilities to leave a low-level equilibrium, as
well as with results from a report showing that utilities in the Danube region with greater
performance generally charge more to their customers (World Bank 2015). Such moves to
higher levels of service generally entail significantly higher investment and subsequently
operating costs, which means that economies of scale are “reinvested” into maintaining
higher levels of service. Only when utility companies have a good initial performance are
they able to lower costs through aggregation (box 4.5).
  Examples of aggregations involving low-performance utilities are not concentrated in
a single country or period but were observed more frequently in Kazakhstan, Romania,
and Poland. In Poland, the aggregations coincided with European Union (EU) member-
ship, after which a number of weak utilities were merged. A small number of more recent
cases of aggregations involving low-performance utilities can be found in Brazil.
  Small utilities (in terms of volume or density) are also found to improve their performance
through aggregations. One interpretation is that particularly small utilities benefit from
aggregations that bring about greater technical and professional capacity. At the same time,
there is no evidence that aggregations systematically decrease unit costs in such cases. The
finding that small utilities seem to be able to improve performance through aggregation is
related to the previous result for utilities that have a low initial performance level: Utilities
that have low performance levels are more common in the group of small utilities (that is,
the ones with fewer customers), and therefore it is not surprising that the empirical results
show that small utilities and those with low initial performance levels can improve more
through aggregation. Examples in this respect are the aggregations in Poland between 2004
and 2010. However, this finding does not apply to the aggregations that occurred in Hungary
in the early 2000s. Although many of the aggregating utilities were small, only a few exhib-
ited weak initial performance.

                                    The Qualitative Evidence

                                    This chapter focuses on the lessons learned from 14 concrete aggregation case studies in
                                    seven countries. It describes why these aggregations have worked well by highlighting
                                    success factors as well as risk factors that were successfully managed.
                                      The 14 case studies present a variety of contexts, purposes, and designs of aggregation.
                                    In a majority of them, aggregations happened in a mixed context of urban and rural
                                    areas,  except in Brazil where rural providers consolidated, and in Mozambique and
                                    Indonesia, where aggregation happened in urban and dense areas. Case studies exhibit a
                                    diversity of performance level from low for Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and Mozambique
                                    to medium for Romania and Portugal, and high for Hungary. The level of development of
                                    these countries also shows significant diversity: low-income for Mozambique; lower-­
                                    middle-income for Indonesia; upper-middle-income for Brazil, Colombia, and Romania;
                                    and high-income for Portugal and Hungary. Processes and scopes of aggregation also
                                    contrast, whereas scale almost always follows administrative boundaries (except in
                                    Brazil). In the Hungary case study, the reform targeted mainly internalities and was done
                                    through a mandated process, whereas in other case studies externalities were sought,
                                    mainly through voluntary processes.
                                      Figure 5.1 reflects the diversity of context among case studies, taking into account GDP
                                    per capita and performance. The size of each utility is also shown through the size of the
                                    dot representing the population served. The performance of each utility has been assessed
                                    qualitatively and ranked from low to medium to high.
                                      Appendix A contains a complete overview of the case studies, presenting the context
                                    and purpose of each aggregation as well as the design and outcomes. In addition, a brief
                                    report on each of the case studies is available on the online toolkit.


                                    Key Success Factors for Aggregation
                                    In some case studies, aggregation has proven successful because of the presence of a local

                                      providing services in a large city as well as in small surrounding municipalities, was eased
                                      by the involvement of a political leader who facilitated the negotiation with mayors and
                                      other political actors. He also encouraged them to fully comply with their responsibilities,
                                      such as transferring all resources agreed upon in due time. As a result, the operator—Triple
                                      A—has received strong political support from the successive governors of the Atlántico
                                      region during the past 12 years, leading to a successful aggregation.

                                   •	 In Indonesia, in the case of PDAM Tirtanadi, national and local stakeholders worked together
                                     to come up with the option best suited for aggregation, thus successfully aligning their interests.
                                     On April 20, 1998, the Ministry of Home Affairs provided a guideline to PDAM Tirtanadi on the
                                     establishment of a holding company as one of the options to aggregate and improve WSS in
                                     North Sumatra. However, on April 30, 1998, following a review of the guideline by the PDAM
                                     Association of North Sumatra, PDAM Tirtanadi decided that its preferred aggregation option
                                     was to arrange specific cooperation agreements with other local PDAMs. This aggregation
                                     option was then presented to governors and heads of districts for approval. Two years later, the
                                     cooperation agreement between PDAM Tirtanadi and PDAM Tirta Deli was signed.

                                   •	 In Romania, the alignment of national and local interests was an important issue during
                                     the regionalization process. Since 2005, Romanian local authorities, whether at county or
                                     municipality levels, have been questioning the regionalization reform designed by the central
                                     government. Owing to the pressure to absorb EU funding, the reform was passed quickly,
                                     which did not allow for proper information and engagement with local authorities and
                                     citizens. The government prepared master plans for each county and did not have time to
                                     complete them with more comprehensive technical and economic data, informed by local
                                     governments. As a result, the whole process was perceived as a top-down takeover of water
                                     services, with hostility from local authorities and citizens escalating when tariff increases
                                     were applied.



                                   Among Local Authorities
                                   A balanced institutional arrangement in which consensus reaching is embedded is key to
                                   aligning local interests and easing decision making in aggregated utilities. Local authorities
                                   may often perceive aggregation as a loss of control over a local public service that they are
                                   used to managing, especially when small municipalities aggregate with large ones.
                                   Moreover, different local authorities may pursue different objectives when aggregating.
                                   As a result, to ensure a successful aggregation, it is important to build ownership and align
                                   the interests of all local authorities joining the aggregation, leaving ample space for local
                                   authorities to adjust the overall aggregation model to their specific circumstances. In addi-
                                   tion, alignment of interests is generally done through balanced decision-making arrange-
                                   ments and voting rights allocation. These governance issues are discussed and developed
                                   further in chapter 6.

                                   Between Local Authorities and Utility Executive Management
                                   Strengthening the working relationship between local authorities and utility executive man-
                                   agement is a key to good governance of aggregated utilities. When services consolidate into
                                   a shared organizational structure, they gain autonomy from local authorities. As a result, the
                                   executive management of the aggregated utility becomes the body responsible for financial
                                   planning and tariff policy, investment program implementation, service operation, adminis-
                                   tration, and commercial activities, as well as customer relationships—functions that used
                                   to be under the direct control of local authorities. Nevertheless, some decisions, especially
                                   regarding tariff policy, still must be approved by utility shareholders during general assem-
                                   bly meetings. Establishing a close and stable working relationship between local authorities
                                   and the utility board of directors and management can help align stakeholders’ interests

                                   •	 In Romania, the president of the Brasov Intercommunal Development Association (IDA),
                                     which includes some municipalities served by Brasov Water Company, is invited to all BWC
                                     Board of Directors meetings to ensure that the company’s management takes into account
                                     the views of the IDA. Moreover, the executive managers must meet a set of objectives and
                                     performance that are monitored by directors and reported on during meetings with share-
                                     holders and IDA members.

                                   •	 In Brazil, the executive structure of SISAR Ceará includes a board of directors with presidents
                                     and chairpersons affiliated with member associations, which hold a vote in the general
                                     assembly.

                                   •	 In Portugal, aggregated municipalities have their own representatives at the Board of
                                     Directors.

                                     In most case studies, aggregation reform was implemented as a top-down process led by

Defining principles but allowing   national stakeholders. This finding is consistent with the global aggregation trends observed
flexibility in implementation      at the international level, as discussed in chapter 3. However, national reforms are more
ensures local ownership.           likely to be successful when they follow the principle of subsidiarity and allow flexibility for
                                   local stakeholders to own the aggregation process and adapt it to their local context.

                                   •	 In Romania, the regionalization established by the 2006 law on public water services con-
                                     sisted of the reorganization of public services through two entities: the intercommunal devel-
                                     opment association (IDA), representing local governments as asset holders, and the regional
                                     operating company (ROC), operating those assets, both of them linked by a delegation con-
                                     tract. However, utilities had the choice to aggregate following their own pace and according
                                     to their preferred scale. Brasov Water Company expanded slowly and progressively in the
                                     nearby municipalities, whereas Raja Constanta expanded over seven counties at a fast pace
                                     (figure 5.2).

                                   •	 In Hungary, the Water Utility Services Act, passed in 2011, states that water licenses will
                                     be  issued to providers that reach a certain level of aggregation, expressed in consumer
                                     equivalent. But no administrative limits, such as watershed or regional boundaries, were set.

                            •	 In Portugal, the creation of Águas do Ribatejo took quite some time, as agreement on a
                              management model was not immediate. In 2001, there were talks with Águas de Portugal
                              to create a “multimunicipal” system, but this solution was dismissed. A second option
                              was to create a common utility and allocate 49 percent of the shares to a private investor.
                              A call for tenders was developed. At that time, the scale of the aggregation had reached
                              nine municipalities. But after a change of political majority and mayor, Santarém, the
                              capital and most populated city of the region, decided to withdraw from the process, con-
                              sidering that it would be subject to an excessive contribution to the common investment
                              and operational costs and that it was not prepared to indirectly subsidize other municipal
                              systems incorporated in Águas do Ribatejo. The municipality of Cartaxo also decided to
                              leave. At the time, this decision was very contentious and strongly changed the premises
                              of the aggregation. The tender was annulled, generating the need for a new consensus and
                              new economic studies to support the feasibility of a common utility. The process resumed
                              in 2007.


                              When the scope of aggregation includes consolidation of functions, a harmonization of

                            up, thus hampering the success of aggregation.

                            •	 In Hungary, the three merging companies, Halasvíz, Kalocsavíz, and Kőrösvíz, brought
                              different operational practices into the merged company, Kiskun-Víz. These practices were
                              harmonized by selecting the “best practice” and introducing them in the operation of the
                              Kiskun-Víz utility. For example, Kalocsavíz had an efficient system for the management of
                              unpaid invoices, which was adopted throughout the aggregated utility. As a result, the overall
                              level of unpaid bills was cut in half.

                            •	 In Brazil, COPANOR is a rural subsidiary of the state company COPASA. Most COPANOR
                              employees earn the national minimum wage. However, there is significant pressure from the
                              labor union to increase wages to levels equivalent to COPASA’s. If COPANOR were to pay its
                              workers the same wages as its “parent company” (COPASA) and continue to charge the same
                              water tariff (capped at 60 percent of its parent company’s tariffs, in 2015), the company’s
                              long-term financial sustainability would be jeopardized.

                                Since 2012, the Croatian government has been initiating a series of utility sector reforms
                                which, in addition to establishing a proper water sector regulatory framework and
                                benchmarking system, have included a proposed merger of utility service providers into
                                about 20 regional utilities. The main drivers of this aggregation effort were the need to
                                efficiently absorb EU funds and to cross-subsidize the operation of water and wastewater
                                systems in smaller settlements, which would find compliance with the new EU standards
                                prohibitively expensive and unaffordable. The process was also seen as an important
                                opportunity for the sector to develop modern, efficient service providers and to move
                                away from the previous way of managing municipal water utilities. The water utility
                                aggregation process was initiated as a central government–driven, top-down activity, with
                                the country divided into water service areas, mostly defined by county boundaries, using
                                the principle of one service area, one service provider, one tariff. It was planned as a
                                two-stage process, where in the first stage WSS services were, where necessary, extracted
                                from municipal utility companies, while in the second stage they were to be aggregated
                                into new WSS utilities (effectively trading scale for scope). A large-scale, ex ante study
                                had demonstrated the likelihood of important economies of scale.

                                After completion of the first phase, in early 2015, aggregation design was completed along
                                with the required legislative framework. However, owing to the sensitivity of the political
                                situation at that moment (2015 was an election year) and potential backlash from local
                                authorities, it first was delayed and then lost political support following the change of the
                                central government. The reform had been driven largely by technocrats within the line
                                ministry, who failed to acknowledge that they lacked the political champion and national
                                government power to impose the reform process over the concerns of local stakeholders.

                                   tion suffered from the absence of a large populated city to act as a nucleus and allow the
                                   implementation of cross-subsidies among settlements to balance differences between urban
                                   and rural water systems, which do not have the same production costs.

                                   In designing and implementing an aggregation, a risk of cherry-picking (Franceys and

Cherry-picking practices can     Gerlach 2008) practices can arise. Service providers naturally prefer to extend services to

                                   government, launched in 1998 and called the Delegated Management Framework, was to
                                   differentiate investment and operation functions for urban water services. The investment
                                   function for all urban water services was to be aggregated into an autonomous public entity,
                                   the “Fund for Investment Ownership and Water Supply Assets” (FIPAG in its Portuguese
                                   acronym), and the operation function delegated to private operators through bidding
                                   processes. The first call for tenders, issued in 1999, was concluded in 2004 for Maputo and
                                   four other major cities. But the contract was prematurely terminated in 2010 for commercial
                                   reasons. FIPAG launched several other bids, which remained unsuccessful as urban water
                                   services suffer from low revenue collection and significant political interference in tariff
                                   policy. The lack of private sector interest in managing urban water services prompted FIPAG
                                   to become the operator of urban utilities across the country.

                                     Case Studies


                                     When aggregation aims to expand coverage or environmental benefits, it often implies
                                     important parallel investment costs, which increase depreciation costs and operational
                                     expenditures (World Bank 2015). Thus, cost savings from economies of scale might be
                                     masked by the higher overall operating expenditures resulting from better services.

                                     In Romania, both Brasov Water Company (BWC) and Raja Constanta implemented large
                                     investment projects, amounting respectively to €200 million and €278 million, to improve
                                     WSS coverage and quality. Following these investments, BWC total OPEX increased by
                                     120 percent for water and 144 percent for wastewater, and OPEX per population served
                                     increased by 63 percent for water and 80 percent for wastewater over nine years. In the
                                     meantime, depreciation costs increased by 58.5 percent for water. For Raja Constanta, the
                                     increase in total OPEX represents 84 percent for water and 79 percent for wastewater over
                                     nine years whereas the OPEX per population served increased by 26 percent for water and
                                     30 percent for wastewater over the same period. In the meantime, depreciation costs
                                     raised by 1,260 percent for water, and 118 percent for wastewater.

•	 In Romania, the aftermath of the regionalization reform revealed cherry-picking practices, as
  some aggregated utilities have extended their operating areas in towns where financial incen-
  tives were granted (box 5.4).

  When aggregation is not only aiming at economic efficiency but also at externalities such
as cross-subsidies, binding rules must be put in place to safeguard the principle of solidarity
and overcome cherry-picking practices.

•	 In Hungary, when aggregation reform was passed in 2011, the Alföldvíz utility decided to
  actively pursue the enlargement of its operating area and carefully selected the municipalities
  where it would take over service provision. A dedicated “merger project team” developed a
  methodology to discriminate between potential merging municipalities. It used a checklist to
  evaluate and assign a grade to each municipality. Despite this selection process, discussions
  were held to learn whether an operating contract should be signed with small, unprofitable
  municipalities. Ultimately, a “principle of solidarity” was applied, aided by the fact that if
  these small, unprofitable municipalities were left unsupplied, the regulator might assign a pro-
  vider of last resort, thus appointing a water utility to provide services in these locations.




    BOX 5.4.   From Cherry-Picking to Withdrawal Practices in Romania


    Over the regionalization process, IDAs have generally accepted all municipalities that
    wanted to join the existing ROC by signing the delegation contract. But some of them
    experienced difficulties in expanding their activity as quickly as needed to provide
    necessary and adequate services in the small settlements that they took over, often
    because of the lack of qualified personnel or financing. As such, IDAs were not “excluding”
    municipalities; however, they were to some extent cherry-picking municipalities that
    would bring along a source of financing. As a result, some municipalities now react by
    either rejecting or withdrawing from the aggregation, moves that may also derive from
    local political issues or other vested interests.

    The municipalities that do not wish to join regional IDA and its ROC have applied for the
    renewal of their water operating licenses. Although these municipalities have hardly any
    access to funding for water supply improvements, they prefer to remain independent than
    join the ROC and see their tariffs go up without any perceived benefit. There are even
    cases where municipalities have joined the IDA and ROC, and are presently withdrawing.
    For instance, in Neamt County, six communes left the IDA in 2015. The main reasons
    for withdrawal are much higher water fees for households and delayed extension or
    rehabilitation of water supply network/sewage systems. To prevent such issues,
    withdrawal procedures must be thoroughly justified and approved by the IDA General
    Assembly. In addition, withdrawing municipalities must repay investments made by
    the ROC in their territory and/or WSS systems.

                           This chapter describes, for the 14 case studies and in the light of the international
                           overview, how aggregations have been concretely designed, following the report’s origi-
                           ­
                           nal typology. It discusses, in particular, the nuts and bolts of setting up a successful
                           aggregated service provider, ranging from deciding on scale and scope, to allocating
                           power, to managing assets and liabilities, and harmonizing IT systems.
                             The chapter builds on the proposed four design dimensions of scope, scale, process,
                           and governance (for more details, refer to chapter 2 and figure 2.1). Rather than providing
                           recommendations, the review seeks to highlight the trade-offs and potential challenges
                           associated with each of those design decisions. For a more complete discussion of the
                           actual range of design option for each of the dimension, refer to chapter 2.


                           Scope
                           Although the scope of aggregation varies among case studies, the unbundling of func-
                           tions, stages, and services is relatively uncommon as it might generate complexities of its
                           own. Furthermore, all functions have been aggregated in all case studies, except in SISAR
                           as the investment function remains at the state level while operations are carried out by
                           SISAR and its members (see table 6.1). This finding is in line with the global trends
                           observed at the international level, where all functions have been aggregated in 92 per-
                           cent of aggregations (see chapter 3). All stages have been aggregated in all case studies
                           except in Águas de Alentejo (Portugal), which supplies bulk water and is in charge of
                           wastewater treatment only. Water and wastewater services have been aggregated in eight
                           case studies. For four case studies, aggregation was limited to water service only, and for
                           one case study the operator is in charge of WSS as well as waste collection.

    BOX 6.1.   Aggregation at Watershed Level in Kosovo


    The main purpose of the Kosovo utility regionalization effort was to transform small and
    fragmented municipal companies into self-sustaining business organizations with a clear
    customer orientation and to create an environment conducive to attaining socioeconomic
    goals for the Kosovar population. The reform of the utility sector took place in the context
    of the authorities’ EU integration agenda, which implied transposition of the relevant
    EC framework and adoption of prudent management principles and practices such as river
    basin management, integrated water resources management, and the like. Before the
    sector reform, 35 municipal companies offered water supply and wastewater collection
    together with other municipal services. The initiators of the reform, which was carried
    out in three phases, decided to follow watershed boundaries rather than administrative
    boundaries in a bid to be better prepared for the significant ramp-up in wastewater
    collection and treatment expected to be a consequence of the country’s effort to join the
    EU (World Bank 2015).

                                      The number of towns in an aggregation varies widely among case studies, ranging from
                                    2  cities for PDAM Intan Banjar (Indonesia) to 239 localities for COPANOR (Brazil). As
                                    stated in chapter 4, aggregations that add only a small number of towns are likely to
                                    achieve greater cost savings than aggregations that involve a large number of towns,
                                    such as large-scale regionalization schemes. Moreover, utilities serving several towns
                                    exhibit more complicated cost-output relationships. As a result, the possible cost sav-
                                    ings of increasing the number of customers in these aggregated utilities are uncertain
                                    and limited.
                                      As described in appendix A, most case studies display aggregation examples grouping
     Having a large utility as      urban and rural settlements. In such configurations, larger urban utilities act as the nuclei
     nucleus can work, but          around which less populated, less profitable, and less well-performing service providers
     aggregation of similar-sized   aggregate. The nuclei help surrounding service providers to improve.
     small utilities can also be
     successful.                    •	 In Colombia, the presence of a large city in the Regional Scheme of Atlántico, which is a devel-
                                      opment hub, allows for horizontal cooperation and economies of scale. It also allows the
                                      implementation of cross-subsidies among settlements and thus the balancing of differences
                                      among water systems that do not have the same production costs. In small and economically
                                      depressed towns, most users have low incomes and purchasing power that would not allow
                                      them to access public services otherwise.

                                    •	 In Indonesia, one of the rationales for aggregation was to have PDAM Tirtanadi—
                                      which already had good technical, financial, and managerial skills—help other, smaller,
                                      s urrounding PDAMs to build and develop those competences.

                                    •	 In Brazil, the aggregation concerns only rural areas; however, while independent, the aggre-
                                      gated service provider was initially set up by and receives support from the respective large
                                      state utility, namely CAGECE for SISAR and COPASA for COPANOR.

                                      Although this heterogeneity of contexts between large and small utilities proved
                                    successful in some aggregations (see chapter 4), it also raises questions about whether to
                                    ­
                                    apply the same policies to all aggregating services and how to prioritize investments and
                                    service improvements. To some extent, there local preferences for service provision may
                                    differ. How the utility management responds to these challenges may vary from case to
                                    case, but it will need conflict resolution mechanisms to align interests and arbitrate
                                    between those that diverge . Alternative successful aggregation models exist when
                                    service providers with similar characteristics group together. The Hungarian utility

                                    Kiskun-Víz was created out of the merger of three water companies of more or less the
                                    same size; this aggregation was successful in terms of economic efficiency. In Austria,

    Founded in 1946, Upper Austria Water is an autonomous nonprofit association of
    more than 1,700 rural service providers located in the Federal State of Upper Austria
    (map B6.2.1). Chaired by a board of seven directors, it is in charge of operations and
    maintenance of small-scale water supply and sewerage systems in rural areas through
    technical assistance (emergency supply, mobile technical equipment), pooling programs
    (for water meter purchase and water analyses, for example), and measurement services
    (such as leak detection, pipe and valve location, flow rates and pressure, and aquifer
    tests). It aims to supply sufficient high-quality and cost-efficient drinking water through
    the construction and operation of autonomous installations. It also provides capacity
    building and staff training, and supports service providers on legal and financial issues.
    Similar models exist in other states of Austria.

                                   •	 In Colombia, the operator Triple A benefited from investment programs to expand supply
                                     capacity that were funded by central and regional governments, representing up to US$50
                                     million. On top of this funding, the financial incentives also took the form of a tax alleviation
                                     that was granted to public services companies during the period in which the law was in
                                     force. This tax discount could represent up to 40 percent of the investment amount.

                                   •	 In Ceará state in Brazil, the investments implemented by the aggregated utility SISAR were
                                     funded for 18 percent by Federal credits and for 82 percent by the central government
                                     through loans from international finance institutions. SISAR investments were targeted
                                     toward initial setup of WSS infrastructure, as most localities covered by the aggregated util-
                                     ity had no water supply. In the state of Minas Gerais, the aggregated utility, COPANOR, was
                                     clearly established by policy decision makers to set up an investment program with funds
                                     originating from the state health sector budget.

                                   •	 In Mozambique, FIPAG received funding from the Dutch government to improve the water
                                     intake, production, and transfers, as well as the distribution systems in Manica, Gondola,
                                     and Chimoio. The infrastructure of Manica and Gondola utilities was completely renewed
                                     and financed as part of the process of their integration.

                                     Long-term financial support can also be brought by external partners. Moreover, linking
                                   the allocation of external funds to the implementation of aggregation at the local level is a
                                   powerful incentive tool to align interests at the national and local levels:

                                   •	 In Romania, the Ministry of Environment took the opportunity of having EU funding to estab-

                                     out in a Guide to Regionalization and Guidelines for Applicants for SOP Funds. The scale of
                                     aggregation of Raja Constanta was shaped by the SOP funds, as the utility chose to expand in
                                     municipalities that benefited from those funds, whether they belonged to Constanta County
                                     or not. As a result, Raja Constanta accessed an overall amount of €278 million in investment
                                     subsidies.

                                     12). The utility Águas do Alentejo benefited from a €70 million investment in the form of
                                     EU subsidies, covering up to 58 percent of its investment programs for the period 2009–2015.

                                          In contrast, when the main purpose intended is economic efficiency, no such incentives
                                        are necessary, as the example of Hungary shows.

         BOX 6.3.   Diversity of Governance Arrangements in Swiss Water Sector


         In Switzerland, WSS services are strongly decentralized as they fall within the
         competences of cantons, which normally delegate the mandate to municipalities. For
         drinking-water supply, municipalities are autonomous when it comes to the choice
         of the structure and organization of the service. Given the very small average size of
         municipalities, the technical and financial capacity to manage complex tasks often do
         not exist. Therefore, municipalities often aggregate tasks such as bulk water treatment
         or wastewater treatment under special-purpose vehicles (Zweckverband). For instance,
         Seewasserverk Hirsacker-Appital is an intermunicipal association created to produce
         drinking water from water from Lake Zurich—a complex and costly task, given the
         country’s high standards for water quality. The governance arrangement for the special-
         purpose vehicle clearly states that each member of the association is entitled to a share of
         the water produced corresponding to the distribution of capital costs and fixed operating
         costs. Each member pays variable OPEX, in accordance with the real quantity of water
         consumed. Regionale Wasserversorgung St. Gallen (RWSG), created in 1993, is a regional
         association of 12 eastern Swiss partners. Its main task is to ensure the operation of the
         lake water treatment plant in Frasnacht, and to produce, transport, and distribute drinking
         water to its members. Individual distribution to households, billing and accounting,
         and overall wastewater collection and treatment remain the responsibility of individual
         municipalities.

         Beyond the common special-purpose vehicle arrangements, Viteos poses a unique
         example of a merger. This public company was created by municipalities to produce
         and distribute drinking water in Neuchâtel District. Swiss municipalities sometimes also
         resort to concession contracts with public operators: Lausanne’s water service has signed
         concession contracts with 17 surrounding municipalities where it distributes bulk water, or
         sometimes retail water, on behalf of local governments.




     governments have been left broad latitude to optimize their operation as they see fit and
     have resorted to customized institutional arrangements suiting their particular scope and
     scale needs, often using special-purpose vehicles. Irrespective of the governance model
     chosen, in most cases, local governments are the main shareholders of the aggregated
     service provider, but regional governments sometimes play a role as well.

                                   •	 Although utilities do not have complete authority to set their tariffs, they are able to

                                      significant impact on performance.

                                   •	 Although most utility managers do not have total control of setting staff salary scales,
                                      they are able to hire and retain qualified staff.

                                   •	 Most public utilities rely on government to source investment financing.

                                   •	 Board members are generally appointed by the government to represent the interests
                                      of owners.

                                   External Accountability

                                   •	 All utilities are subject to well-defined performance targets.

                                   •	 Performance contracts are useful tools for sharing information but have limitations for
                                      enforcing performance.

                                   •	 The use of external auditors to enhance fiduciary responsibilities is almost universal.

                                   •	 Most public utilities require authorization to secure external financing.

                                   •	 External groups can be represented in utility advisory or management oversight bodies.

                                   •	 Independent regulatory arrangements are the exception rather than the norm, because
                                      most utilities are regulated by their owners.

                                   Internal Accountability for Results

                                   •	 Senior management systematically reports to their boards on performance.

                                   •	 Incentive-based systems for top management are common.

           Market Orientation

           •	 Utilities outsource mostly noncore functions and retain core functions.

           •	 Although benchmarking exercises are becoming common, there are no clear-cut
              paradigms for using data collected for improving performance.

           •	 Most utilities are not involved in market testing.

           Customer Orientation

           •	 Public water utilities have developed billing and collection systems that best
              overcome specific constraints faced by various groups of customers.

           •	 Public utilities actively survey their customers to learn their opinions and views.

           •	 Customers have the opportunity to express their preferences regarding service
              options.

           •	 Customers are informed about service changes or interruptions.

           •	 Utilities have developed effective complaint mechanisms.

           Corporate Culture

           •	 Well-defined mission statements provide an internal indicator of good corporate
              culture.

           •	 Performance is the basis for salary increases in most utilities.

           •	 Utilities provide ample career opportunities to their staff and experience low
              turnover.

           •	 Water utilities have training programs for their staff as part of their annual perfor-
              mance agreements.

           •	 Staff members are informed of management decisions on a need-to-know basis.

     •	 In Portugal, Águas do Ribatejo, a public limited company created to provide bulk and retail
       water services, was able to set up a higher uniform water tariff in the seven municipalities in
       its service area. This new tariff represented a 7 to 8 percent increase in the two municipalities
       where tariffs were highest before aggregation and a 600 percent increase in the municipality
       that previously had the lowest tariffs. This tariff policy was viewed as a positive management
       improvement toward sustainability, as the price before aggregation was heavily subsidized
       by municipal budgets and did not reflect cost-reflective.

                                    Corporatization also brings managerial independence to utilities that can make their own
                                  decisions regarding staff recruitment or wage policy, thus lowering or preventing political
                                  interference and patronage.


                                  •	 In Portugal, when the public limited company Águas do Ribatejo was created, about
                                        percent of its initial staff were transferred employees. The remaining 50 percent were
                                    50  ­
                                    selected by the utility during the implementation.

                                    Corporatization brings efficiency improvements as utility managers and staff behave in a
                                  more business-like fashion. Indeed corporatization is a way to modify the incentives of the
                                  WSS utility and make it act in a more customer-oriented way.


                                  •	 In Romania, both the Constanta and the Brasov water operators have been turned into com-
                                    mercial companies as a result of the regionalization reform. In both utilities, the executive
                                    management staff must meet a number of objectives and performance indicators which are
                                    monitored continuously by the Board of Directors, the General Assembly of shareholders,
                                    and the intermunicipal body.

                                  •	 In Portugal, the capital of Águas do Ribatejo is the infrastructure of the utility, and shares are
                                    allocated to municipalities according to the value of the asset they transferred: Almeirim,
                                    15.45  percent; Alpiarça, 5.40 percent; Benavente, 16.44 percent; Chamusca, 8.15 percent;
                                    Coruche, 15.03 percent; Salvaterra de Magos, 14.19 percent; Torres Novas, 25.34 percent. In the
                                    Águas Públicas do Alentejo Partnership, the decision-making arrangements derive from the
                                    conditions of the state-municipalities partnership. Municipalities instituted a specific associa-

                                    and accounts. The balance of power between the state and municipalities in the Partnership
                                    Commission and the existence of only two shareholders creates a need for a permanent search

                                       Allocating equal participation to Brasov County Council and Brasov Municipality was aimed
                                       at balancing powers and reaching consensus to avoid unilateral decisions. In addition, under
                                       Romanian law, strategic decisions must be adopted by a vote of two-thirds, which in Brasov
                                       made consensus compulsory. For Raja Constanta, the County Council holds 97 percent of the

                                     •	 In Mozambique, FIPAG is a public autonomous entity, created by the government, that is
                                       under the guardianship of the Ministry of Public Services, Housing, and Water Resources. It
                                       was created to own, manage, and invest in urban water assets. Despite the initial plan of the
                                       government to attract private operators, FIPAG had to take over operation and maintenance
                                       of utilities. In this context, the role of local authorities was significantly reduced, though some
                                       form of coordination remains, mainly for planning purposes. All other decisions are vested in
                                       FIPAG, which also appoints utilities managers from its own staff.

                                     About half of the case study utilities experienced tariff increases after aggregation.
                                     In Portugal, this increase was thoroughly anticipated as a consequence of the large
                                     investment programs planned within the aggregation framework. The utility adopted a
                                     uniform cost-reflective tariff following a principle of solidarity across the operating area.
                                     In Brazil, SISAR gradually raised its uniform tariff to achieve operational cost recovery,
                                     as reaching financial sustainability was a major target of the utility. Throughout the
                                     aggregation process, all tariff increases were approved by SISAR’s member associations.
                                     In Romania, however, it was more difficult to pass tariff increases and some municipalities
                                     opposed them. To raise tariffs more easily, utilities chose to upgrade service quality
                                     through important investments, thus increasing customers’ willingness to pay. They also
                                     showed a strong determination in charging fees according to the delegated contract
                                     provisions and successfully overcame municipalities’ resistance. In other case studies,
                                     such as those of COPANOR, Alföldvíz, and Kiskun-Víz, the regulatory authority caps water
                                     tariffs. This prevents utilities from raising fees although they feel they would need to in
                                     order to ensure operational cost recovery and financial sustainability.




                                 •	 In Hungary, both Alföldvíz and Kiskun-Víz are applying different tariffs in the municipalities
                                   of their operating areas, depending on the category of customer and the metering diameter.

                                 •	 In Portugal, in Águas do Ribatejo, there was no specific provision about entry or exit of
                                   municipalities. When the municipality Torres Novas joined two years after the setup of the
                                   aggregated utility, a specific negotiation took place but no formal rules were established. In
                                   Águas do Alentejo, the initial partnership agreement did not provide any entry rules but a

                                •	 In Romania, during the aggregation reform, little emphasis was put on the definition of entry
                                  and exit rules. The exit rule boils down to the reimbursement of all amounts invested by the
                                  operator minus the depreciation costs already paid. In Raja Constanta, only one town got out
                                  of the project because of tariff policy disagreements. When leaving, the town of Borcea paid
                                  financial compensation to Raja for the investments made. In the meantime, exit clauses have
                                  been reinforced to make political decision makers more accountable for such decisions.

                                  or wastewater, and sometimes waste collection). Each contract has its own economic balance,
                                  and costs and revenues are contract specific. However, since 2014, the Atlántico operating

                                    •	 In Hungary, the Kiskun-Víz utility took on all contractual obligations from the three merging
                                      companies. These liabilities usually did not extend to more than 1.5 to 2 years after the
                                      merger. The supplier contracts that were not advantageous for Kiskun-Víz were simply not
                                      renewed after they expired. The Alföldvíz utility signed management and operating con-

                                  were subject to a selection process to determine their rank and job assignment. Staff from
                                  other local water utilities were also taken on when cooperation agreements were signed.

Chapter 7   Guidance For A Successful Aggregation

            This chapter sums up the lessons learned about successful aggregations based on the
            evidence gathered at the international level, through the statistical analysis and the
            14  case studies. It then proposes recommendations and specific guidance for a
            ­
            successful aggregation, shaping lessons learned into a road map and pointing out key
            decision points.


            Lessons Learned
            The list below consolidates the main lessons and observations from the report’s various
            evidence bases, including the global data set (chapter 3), the IB-Net database (chapter 4),
            and the various case studies (chapters 5 and 6). Page numbers indicate the section of the
            report where the lesson learned is discussed in greater detail.

            What Are Global Aggregation Trends?
            •	 The level of decentralization of WSS services increases in countries with
              higher levels of development and overall service coverage.                             20

            •	 Aggregation is a relatively recent trend mainly observed in African, European,
              and Latin American countries.                                                          21

            •	 Aggregation is more predominant in countries where local governments are
              responsible for WSS service delivery.                                                  22

            •	 The predominant aggregation type is a top-down, mandated process, targeted
              toward economic efficiency, encompassing all functions and services, following
              administrative boundaries, and taking the form of a merger.                            23

            •	 Aggregations are happening in a diversity of contexts but are more frequent in
              countries with high WSS services coverage.                                             27

            •	 Aggregations in countries with limited sector performance are predominantly
              aiming at improving services, whereas in countries where the coverage is high,
              economic efficiency is the main driver.                                                27

            •	 Countries with smaller utilities and more fragmented water sectors pursue
              voluntary aggregations more frequently.
              ­                                                                                       27


            When Do They Work? The Quantitative Evidence
            •	 Utilities serving several towns do not see a straightforward decrease in unit costs
              when their size increases.                                                             35

            •	 Most aggregations involve larger, urban utility companies taking over smaller,
              more rural towns, and therefore tend to add few customers and decrease density.        36

            •	 Utilities going through aggregation do not see decreases in the cost of labor, a key
              expenditure and expected area of economies of scale.                                   36

     •	 Limited, less complex aggregations, and aggregations of utilities that are already
       serving multiple towns, are more likely to achieve cost savings.                     41

     •	 Aggregations that involve small or weak utilities tend to improve their overall
       performance, but costs do not decrease as economies of scale are reinvested into
       maintaining the improved services.                                                   41


     Why Do They Work? The Qualitative Evidence
     Success factors

     •	 Having a stable champion throughout the aggregation often improves the likelihood
       of success.45

     •	 Building ownership and aligning the interests of stakeholders at all levels
       is essential.                                                                        47

     •	 Defining principles but allowing flexibility in implementation ensures
       local ownership.                                                                     48

     •	 Results take time; gradual improvement strategies with a consequent
       focus on results are particularly successful.                                        49

     Risks

     •	 When political leadership changes over time, aggregation can be jeopardized.        53

     •	 Harmonization of administrative practices may level performance
       down and costs up.                                                                   53

     •	 Transaction costs can hamper aggregation success.                                   54

     •	 Not acknowledging context and purpose when designing an aggregation
       can lead to failure.                                                                 55

     •	 Cherry-picking practices can undermine the outcome of an aggregation whose
       purpose involves externalities such as cross-subsidies or capacity transfers.        56

     How Do They Work? Concrete Insights
     Scope

     •	 In countries where WSS coverage is high, aggregations encompass water
       and wastewater services.                                                             59

     •	 Very few case studies of aggregation include unbundling stages between bulk
       and retail activities.                                                               60

     •	 Aggregation of all functions is the common situation; however, there are
       examples of utilities where only some functions were to be aggregated.               60


     Scale

     •	 Although aggregations along administrative boundaries are predominant, they do not
       necessarily encompass contiguous territories.                                        61


84   Joining Forces for Better Services?
•	 The population and number of towns covered by an aggregation vary
  widely depending on the initial urban versus rural context.                            61

•	 Having a large utility as nucleus can work, but aggregation of similar-sized
  small utilities can also be successful.                                                64


Process
•	 Countries using aggregation as part of a broader sector reform package—for example,
  in the context of European accession—have usually settled on a mandated,
  top-down process.                                                                      66

•	 Financial support and/or incentives (a “Big Push”) are important to help services
  get out of the low-level equilibrium trap.                                             67


Governance
•	 Aggregations in EU countries have tended to use long-term delegated arrangements
  signed with public operators, whereas aggregations in other countries have
  tended to use mergers.                                                                 68

•	 Aggregation forces more explicit decision-making processes, leading to better
  corporate governance.                                                                  71

•	 Establishing a system of checks and balances among shareholders is important.         73

•	 Strong citizen engagement and clear accountability mechanisms should be put
  in place in parallel with the aggregation.                                             74

•	 Oversight of tariffs is usually done by a shareholders assembly within the country’s
  overall regulatory framework.                                                          76

•	 Not all aggregated utilities use uniform tariffs across their service area.           76

•	 Setting clear exit and entry clauses encourages joining and ensures
  orderly withdrawal.                                                                    77

•	 Cost- and revenue-sharing agreements vary according to the governance
  form of the aggregation.                                                               78

•	 Asset ownership, development, and management depend on the form of
  ­
  governance of the aggregation.                                                         78

•	 In most case studies, liabilities are dealt with separately from the aggregation.     79

•	 Managing staff transfer is key to mitigating transaction costs.                       79

•	 IT systems and administrative practices harmonization take time and can be costly.    80

     and purpose intended, continuing to the design of a successful aggregation process and its
     implementation, and finally looking at how to sustain such success. For each stage, the
     figure and underlying table (table 7.1) summarize the key messages emerging from this
     study and refer to more specific sections of the report and associated toolkit (accessible at
     www.worldbank.org/water/aggregationtoolkit) for further resources.
       Table 7.1 also indicates the approximate timeline for each stage, based on the experience
     collected in the case studies. Overall, aggregations are long-term efforts rather than short-
     term policy fixes, taking anywhere from 3 to 20 years, although individual circumstances
     can affect the duration of each stage significantly.

 When you need to…                                                                    Consider the following…
                                                  DECIDING whether to conduct an aggregation
                                                                     Typically 1–3 years

Understand the policy purpose you        •	 The main purpose(s) of the aggregation process (lowering costs, improving performance, establishing
seek to achieve and the context             cross-subsidies, and so on) and the overall context in which you operate will influence the design and
in which it takes place                     implementation of the aggregation (chapter 2). Understanding and analyzing the physical context and
                                            enabling environment is a key prerequisite to deciding whether to pursue an aggregation process and to
                                            designing it properly (chapter 4). As part of the context analysis, it is important to identify the vested
                                            interests of all stakeholders that will be affected by aggregation, so as to tackle the potential problems,
                                            conflicts, or resistance and their potential impacts on the aggregation process. These stakeholders comprise
                                            not only national and local elected officials but also staff, customers, and the general public (chapter 5).

                                         •	 Some aggregations failed because the champions did not understand who would win and lose from the
                                            process, did not build the necessary coalition with winners, and did not offer incentives to bring potential
                                            losers on board. Take the time to understand the political economy of the sector and proposed reform before
                                            deciding (chapter 5; box 5.2).

Decide whether aggregation               •	 Make sure aggregation is the right policy tool for the context or purpose. For instance, small and less
is the right policy option to               complex aggregations are more likely to achieve cost savings. In contrast, economic efficiency may be hard
achieve your purpose                        to achieve if the utility is trapped in a low-level equilibrium (chapter 2; box 2.1). Small utilities tend to
                                            see their performance increase through aggregation; expanding utilities that already serve several towns
                                            can create cost savings. Economic efficiency is more likely to be achieved when the sector is mature and
                                            performing well (box 4.5). There might be other sector reform options more suitable to achieve the purpose
                                            sought (box 6.2).

                                         •	 Aggregation can take more than a decade to deliver its benefits. Do not expect quick outcomes, and allow
                                            some time for them to materialize. Set up performance-based monitoring to report on progress at timely
                                            intervals (chapter 5).

                                         •	 Aggregations will often involve trade-offs between service quality and cost of service; be prepared to
                                            understand and communicate those trade-offs clearly to stakeholders to build their principal support for the
                                            reform.

                                         •	 When coupled with support for investments, aggregation can act as a Big Push, helping utilities get out of
                                            a low-level equilibrium (characterized by low cost and low quality). However, costs (and tariffs) are likely to
                                            increase alongside service quality (chapters 4, 6, box 5.3, box 6.5).

Identify other complementary policy      •	 Conducting successful aggregation requires the proper policy and legal instruments to be in place, in
actions that will be necessary              particular with regard to the regulatory framework or the corporate governance of utility companies.
                                            In some countries, legal barriers with regard to responsibility for and delegation of service provision,
                                            competition rules, or public asset transfers might need to be addressed before the aggregation is
                                            launched (chapter 6, box 6.4).

 When you need to…                                                                       Consider the following…
                                                             DESIGNING a successful aggregation
                                                                        Typically 1–5 years

Engage with stakeholders to build            •	 Ensure that the design is widely consulted and validated with politicians, local officials, and utility
ownership and defuse conflict                  managers to ensure all interests are taken into account during the design of aggregation. Also implement
                                               communication and engagement campaigns with unions, media, customers, and civil society to gain
                                               cooperation and acceptance from those parties (chapter 5, box 5.2).

Define the appropriate scope                 •	 Small utility providers aggregating together are more likely to achieve performance improvements
and scale to achieve the                       (chapters 3, 4, and 6); however, costs might not decrease as economies of scale are “reinvested” into
purpose intended                               better services.

                                             •	 Include a large utility in the aggregation to act as a nucleus only if this is necessary to achieve your purpose;
                                               look at alternative models to achieve the same purpose while grouping primarily providers of the same size
                                               (chapter 6, box 6.2).

                                             •	 Cost savings are easier to reach for small and less complex aggregations (chapter 4).

                                             •	 Be mindful of the risk of cherry-picking, which could undermine the achievement of the aggregation’s
                                               purpose if strong externalities are involved and providers are left with loopholes to opt in and out on the
                                               basis of their individual interests (chapter 5, box 5.4).

                                             •	 Whereas most aggregations involve all functions and follow administrative boundaries, there are successful
                                               examples of more narrow aggregations of either scope (chapter 6, box 6.3, box 6.2) or scale (chapter 6,
                                               box 6.1)—so be open and explore options.

Select a governance model that will          •	 Take the opportunity of the aggregation to adopt strong corporate governance practices to ensure financial
ensure success                                 and managerial autonomy as well as business-oriented practices, while maintaining clear accountability to
                                               shareholders (chapter 6).

                                             •	 Set clear rules of the games to address routine decision making as well as the unexpected: entry and exit
                                               rules, asset transfer, voting rights and power distribution, cost and revenue sharing, investment decisions,
                                               and so on (chapter 6).

                                             •	 Compensate for loss of accountability by embedding mechanisms in the utility routine to reduce distance
                                               from customers (give customers the possibility to complain, improve responsiveness through website and
                                               upgrading of IT systems) (chapter 6).

                                             •	 Design a balanced governance arrangement in which consensus reaching is embedded, to overcome local
                                               authorities’ fear of loss of control; this can be done through a balanced allocation of voting rights (equal
                                               allocation, or according to population served, to volume sold, to asset ownership) (chapter 6).

                                             •	 Choose the legal form adapted to your purpose, scale, and scope (chapter 3, box 6.3): pure economic
                                               efficiency might be best achieved through special-purpose vehicles focused on a narrow scope, whereas a
                                               broad cross-subsidy scheme might be better served by a full merger solution in which costs and revenues are
                                               not separated across service areas.

                                             •	 Aggregation must be designed as a long-term process and as such should not rely on specific circumstances
                                               that might change over time (enlightened mayor, specific crisis, and so on) (chapter 5).

Agree on the process that will most likely   •	 Design the process of aggregation in accordance with the purpose targeted: externalities are easier to
lead to success                                reach through incentivized or financially supported processes whereas internalities may be reached through
                                               voluntary (or incentivized) processes (chapters 2, 3, and 6).

                                             •	 When designing aggregation, leave space for local flexibility and ownership, following a principle of
                                               subsidiarity. This will help gain support from local stakeholders and ensure that the final design is the most
                                               appropriate to ensure the success of the aggregation (chapter 5).

                                             •	 Be aware of key elements that generate transaction costs, such as staff transfer, liabilities, and consolidation
                                               of IT systems, and seek to mitigate them by planning ahead (chapters 2 and 5).

                                                         Typically 1–10 years if the aggregation is gradual

Establish the appropriate legal                •	 A proper legal framework must be in place before the aggregation process can be implemented. Given the
framework for the aggregation                    time that some legislative changes might require, plan and deploy the corresponding laws and bylaws ahead

                                               •	 Be clear about expected outcome and trade-offs, and communicate on progress achieved, as in many cases,
                                                 costs and tariffs are likely to go up along with service quality (chapter 5).

                                               •	 Strengthen the working relationship between local authorities and utility executive management through
                                                 regular meetings, monitored performance, and objective indicators, and the like (chapter 5).

Define the necessary incentives to align       •	 Align interests at all levels in a sustainable and reliable manner using financial, legal, or other incentives,
interests at various levels                      for instance, to compensate the perceived loss of control of certain stakeholders and ensure the interests of
                                                 various stakeholders are broadly aligned behind the aggregation’s purpose (chapters 5 and 6).

                                               •	 Externalities are easier to reach when financial support is provided to aggregating utilities, as it helps them
                                                 fund investment projects (chapter 6).

                                               •	 When financial support is provided by external partners, consider linking the allocation of external funds to
                                                 the implementation of aggregation through eligibility criteria, as it is an effective tool to boost aggregation
                                                 (chapter 6).

Provide the necessary technical                •	 Provide financial and technical support, especially to small utilities, to implement aggregation and address
and financial support to                         transaction costs, both one-off and long-term ones (chapter 5).
aggregating entities                           •	 Provision of technical assistance by the government or donors can be effective to help local stakeholders
                                                 tailor an aggregation to their conditions and needs (chapter 5).

                                               •	 Investment (co-)financing (EU, state) is an important incentive, but it can have perverse consequences
                                                 such as rushing reforms to meet tight deadlines to spend aid, encouraging white elephants or suboptimal
                                                 solutions, or degrading cost recovery levels. Be mindful not to create perverse incentives when designing
                                                 them (chapter 5).

Manage the risks linked to the                 •	 Mitigate cherry-picking practices by encouraging principle of solidarity and establishing stringent criteria for

                                               •	 Anticipate and lower transaction costs as much as possible (IT systems merger and management, staff
                                                 transfer and wages harmonization policies) (chapter 5).

                                               •	 Set up harmonization processes to ensure that service management improves its capacity, through best

Document the process and publicize             •	 Show and document success to build and keep stakeholder commitment through performance-based
success to all stakeholders                      monitoring, accountability mechanisms, and the like (chapter 5).

Learn from challenges and adjust               •	 Adjust the framework through a gradual improvement strategy, after reviewing monitored achievements
accordingly                                      against purposes (chapter 5).

Chapter 8   Conclusions

            At the start of the study, the team set out to provide concrete, evidence-based policy
            guidance on when, why, and how the aggregation of water and sanitation utilities can
            successfully deliver specific policy outcomes. Perhaps not unexpectedly, the evidence
            base is not always as conclusive and clear-cut as a policy maker would want. Some of
            the conclusions might appear counterintuitive or contradict conventional wisdom. The
            authors consider that this, in itself, is an important finding as it underlines the impor-
            tance, for policy makers and practitioners, of pausing and thinking about reforms before
            replicating a model that might have appeared successful in a different context, for a dif-
            ferent purpose. That being said, a few broad conclusions can be derived from the overall
            effort, in addition to the more detailed guidance provided in the previous chapters.

            1.	 Aggregation is a policy option, not a panacea for all sector challenges. A growing num-
              ber of national and local governments are turning to aggregation to face the double
              challenge of increasing demand for better services and limited fiscal space. In many
              cases, those aggregations have delivered positive outcomes but not always those
              expected initially. In some cases, the process has stalled or failed because it was not
              the right policy action or because it was poorly designed. One-off and long-term
              transaction costs have prevented expected economies of scales from materializing
              at the scale expected.

            2.	 Aggregations come in many different shapes and forms, depending on the local circum-
              stances. The scope, scale, process, and governance of aggregation processes varies
              greatly between regions and countries, and even within countries. Whereas some util-
              ities chose to associate with neighboring ones only for specific functions such as the
              purchase of chemicals, others fully merge their operation at the regional level or set up
              a separate company to manage shared assets such as a large-scale water treatment
              plant. That diversity of cases reflects the diversity of local circumstances, and govern-
              ments developing aggregation reforms would do well to leave space for those to be
              taken into account in the final design of an aggregation.

            3.	 The design of a successful aggregation will depend on the intended purpose of the aggre-
              gation, as well as on the overall context in which it takes place. For practitioners and
              policy makers considering an aggregation process, the report recommends considering
              first what policy outcome is being sought—better services? lower costs? solidarity
              between urban and rural areas? environmental benefits?—as well as the overall
              context—political economy, performance and size of utilities, and so on—before design-
              ing the aggregation’s scope, scale, governance, and process, taking into consideration
              the guidance provided in the previous chapters. Most of the cases of failure are linked
              to designs that responded poorly to the combination of purpose and context in which
              the aggregation was taking place.

     4.	In the developing world, aggregation is primarily a means to deliver better services rather
       than to lower costs. Many practitioners associate aggregations with the concept of econo-
       mies of scale and expect to see cost reductions. However, in many cases, the preaggrega-
       tion costs of services are below those necessary to provide a reasonable quality of service
       (at a low-level equilibrium). In fact, this work shows that most often, in particular in the
       developing world, aggregations involve larger municipal companies taking over smaller,
       underperforming ones nearby, often with significant infrastructure investments, with an
       aim to improve the coverage and quality of services—in effect taking such utilities out
       of  their low-level equilibrium. In such cases, costs increase alongside service quality,
       a necessary but not always expected outcome of the aggregation.

     5.	 Aggregation is a gradual, long-term process that requires strong stakeholder commitment.
       Aggregations take time to design and even more time to implement and sustain. Among
       the study’s 14 concrete cases, only 2 took fewer than 5 years in total, with some needing as
       many as 20 years to fully consolidate their effect. Aggregations shift the balance of power
       among stakeholders significantly and therefore require time to build support and consen-
       sus in the first place. In addition, utilities that aggregate often do so in successive phases
       rather than in a single step, as success breeds success. Finally, many aggregated utilities
       find that dealing with harmonization issues, whether human resources, IT systems, or
       administrative processes, is best pushed to after the merger and addressed gradually once
       the dust settles and the commitment to an aggregated provider grows.

     6.	Finally, aggregations are most successful when accompanied by a broader sector reform
       addressing governance, financing, and regulatory issues at the sector level. Many countries
       accompany the aggregation process with a solid sector reform package ranging from clar-
       ifying arrangements for corporate governance, to establishing a solid regulatory frame-
       work and a financing program that not only provides incentives for aggregation, but also
       helps achieve some of the performance gains that are often desired from the process
       (embodying the concept of the “Big Push”).

       This study does not pretend to provide a definitive answer to the question of when,
     why, and how aggregation can successfully deliver specific policy outcomes. Aggregation
     is a relatively recent phenomenon, and longer time series would be necessary to under-
     stand the long-term impact of aggregation. Similarly, the data sets do not allow a com-
     plete understanding of the transaction costs that emerge during aggregations, how they
     evolve over time, and how best to mitigate them. Aggregations are conducted for a wide
     variety of purposes, and the available data primarily allow an understanding of effective-
     ness only with regard to cost savings and performance improvements. And of course, the
     case studies demonstrate time and again the importance of a favorable political economy
     and overall country environment for the success of the process, but more work is neces-
     sary in that regard.

  Nevertheless, the authors hope that this study has shed some light on the complexities
and trade-offs associated with designing and implementing aggregation reforms, while pro-
viding relevant guidance on how to make such reforms as successful as possible. With that,
the hope is that this work enables policy makers and practitioners who are considering
aggregation to better understand whether it is a relevant policy option for them, and to use
the analysis and case studies to make more informed decisions about the design and imple-
mentation of the process.

Appendix B   Statistical Analysis Methodology
             Overview
             Much of the literature relied heavily on cross-sectional comparisons of utility structure
             and its connection to performance. For example, do systems with high volumes exhibit
             lower unit cost than systems with low volumes? When considering an aggregation reform,
             the relevant policy question is, however, whether the utility improved when compared
             with the situation if it did not aggregate. The IB-Net data has shown that aggregations
             often add little volume and tend to decrease density; hence, a comparison of low- and
             high-volume utilities could be very misleading.
               In the statistical analysis, utility performance was monitored before and after consoli-
             dations for aggregating utilities and compared with non-aggregating utilities. To this end,
             regressions including utility-fixed effects are run to compare the performance change of
             consolidating firms with non-consolidating firms. As the data show, aggregating utilities
             differ from the average utility in IB-Net, suggesting that the choice of the control group—
             for example, the utilities without aggregation that are used as a comparison—might be
             important for the results obtained. With the overall goal of a counter-factual scenario—of
             what the average cost of a utility would be in the absence of a consolidation—not all utili-
             ties are suitable for comparison.
               For this reason, different matching techniques were used to select suitable comparison
             utilities. In each case, a large set of pretreatment characteristics—to estimate the proba-
             bility that a utility experiences a consolidation—was used to identify the final sample.
             Depending on the matching algorithm, one or several utilities with similar treatment
             probability were then chosen as the control group. While the combined analysis of water
             and wastewater was continued (volume is the sum of water produced and wastewater
             collected), for the choice of comparison units the separate indicators are used. Hence, the
             variables to estimate the probability of an aggregation include important utility charac-
             teristics such as the population in the service area and the number of towns served, sep-
             arately for water and wastewater. The pretreatment performance of a utility with regard
             to managerial and operating efficiency (WUPI) is also added. Finally, dummies for coun-
             try as well as year enter the specification to capture heterogeneity across countries and
             time. The former is particularly relevant, as some countries do not experience any aggre-
             gations while others experience a considerable number.
               Apart from the statistical necessity of balancing utility characteristics between treatment
             and control groups, this approach also ensures that the consolidation effects are evaluated
             in comparison with utilities of similar initial size and that utilities exhibit similar shares of
             water and wastewater services. As the empirical literature has stressed decreasing econo-
             mies of scale and even diseconomies of scale, it seems imperative to match utilities accord-
             ing to their production structure in size and scope. The production characteristics were
             first added linearly, before adding squared terms where necessary to achieve balancing.

        As the choice of the matching algorithm is somewhat arbitrary, three matching
      approaches were used and also the complete sample of utilities, which boils down to using
      four control groups: (i) nearest-neighbor propensity score matching, (ii) four-nearest-­
      neighbor propensity score matching, (iii) radius matching, and (iv) all utilities in the sample.
      The different algorithms (i) to (iii) represent choices in the trade-off between bias and vari-
      ance. All three algorithms were limited to the utilities on common support. The complete
      sample, (iv), is displayed for comparison reasons but should be interpreted with care as the
      compared utilities differ substantially.
        These subsamples of comparable treatment and control utilities are then used in the
      generalized difference-in-difference specification, where the performance indicators are
      regressed on the aggregation indicator, which is 1 in years following an aggregation and
      zero otherwise.
        In addition to variable cost per cubic meter (in natural logs of dollar converted local
      currency), indicators for coverage, service quality, and managerial efficiency as well as the
      composite performance indicator WUPI were distinguished. Looking at various performance
      indicators is necessary because aggregations can follow various purposes, and achieving
      scale economies may not be a goal at all. The regressions include utility and time-fixed
      effects, which means that the effect of an aggregation is identified by comparing unit costs
      over time and between treated and control utilities.
        It should be noted that the use of variable cost gives the estimates a short-term
      interpretation. Capital stock with regard to the network infrastructure is certainly fixed,
      making a modification infeasible or prohibitively costly. The durability of water pipes is typ-
      ically very long term—up to 50 years, depending on the situation and the material—which
      would indicate that the system configuration is fixed for a very long time horizon. Although
      a comprehensive analysis of short- and long-run costs would still be desirable, this was not
      feasible with the data at hand.
        Given the discussions in the previous sections, the effect of aggregations might depend
      both on the initial structure of the utility and on how the aggregation changes a utility’s
      structure. To allow for the possibility that the effect of the aggregations is not independent
      of the size of the change, the above model was re-run with the indicator variable replaced by
      dummy variables distinguishing small aggregations (less than 20 percent more towns),
      medium aggregations (between 20 percent and 100 percent change in the number of towns),
      and large aggregations (more than 100 percent change in the number of towns).
        Similar specifications were run for small (less than −5 percent), medium (between
      −5 percent and 5 percent), and large changes (greater than 5 percent) in density and volume.
      Moreover, to make the aggregation effect conditional on the initial structure of the utility,
      the simple treatment dummy was replaced by adding dummy variables distinguishing util-
      ities with few towns (2 towns), utilities with an intermediate number of towns (between
      4  and 14), and utilities with many towns (more than 14). Again, the same if repeated
      with  dummies indicating utilities of small, medium, and large density and  volume.

                                       A Note on the Calculation of the Water Utility Performance Index
                                       The Water Utility Performance Index (WUPI) used to measure the overall performance of
                                       a utility (in terms of coverage, service quality, and efficiency) is built from a set of 10 stan-
                                       dard key performance indicators. For utilities providing only water or only wastewater
                                       services, only the relevant subindicators are used. The indicators are best practice indica-
                                       tors, with higher values indicating better performance. By construction, the indicators range
                                       from 0 to 100, with 0 for the lower bound values, 100 for the higher bound values, and a
                                       linear interpolation in between. The three outcome indicators are then the average value of
                                       the subindicators (table III.1).
                                         In addition, the overall WUPI is used as an aggregate performance measure. This index is
                                       constructed as the unweighted average of all 10 key performance indicators in table B.1.
                                       As discussed in the State of Sector Report (World Bank 2015), the index is not only consistent
                                       with other aggregate performance indicators such as IB-Net’s APGAR score but also robust
                                       to missing values.
