About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Environmental Resources Department
      Agency : O ce of Permits Management (OGPe) - Natural and Environmental
      Resources Department

      BuildCo must obtain recommendations from the di erent agencies, which
      would be centralized by the O ce of Permits Management (OGPe). After
      having received all the requests, OGPe would process each recommendation
      with the relevant agency and will notify BuildCo when all of them have been
      compiled.


      As this is a transition process, many companies still make several visits, calls
      and follow-ups with the OGPe to obtain their nal recommendations.
      Additionally, these recommendations are still lled by many architects at
      di erent times, increasing the cost they need to pay (USD 100.00 for each
      request).


      When the process is fully implemented, it is expected that only one request
      for all recommendations would be necessary and each agency would have a
      maximum time limit to reply. At the end, BuildCo will receive its
      recommendation document via email.

      Prior to ling the construction permit application, BuildCo must le a
      Preliminary Development Application/"Anteproyecto" Application with the
      San Juan Permits O ce. San Juan is an autonomous municipality and for this
      reason, certain approvals must be requested with the San Juan Permits
      O ce rather than with the O ce of Permits Management (OGPe).

      This ling is required to determine whether the project, as planned, complies
      with zoning and construction regulations of the Puerto Rico Planning Board
      and Municipality of San Juan's Zoning Regulations.

       Agency : Private licensed company

       BuildCo will request a soil test for the structural calculations for the
       foundation. Contractors ask for a soil test to ensure that the foundation of
       the building is solid. The engineer must understand the suitability of the soil
       for the proposed construction work. It allows to build a solid foundation and
       avoid structures to be damaged or collapsed or leaned.

   6   Obtain results of topographical study                                               14 days   USD 1,250
       Agency : Private licensed company

       A topographical study is conducted prior to construction to measure the
       levels on the speci c terrain. It is a general technical requirement when
       building a structure of this class.

       Institute of Culture (Instituto de Cultura de Puerto Rico)
       Agency : O ce of Permits Management (OGPe) - Puerto Rico Institute of
       Culture (Instituto de Cultura de Puerto Rico)

       Since 2006, all construction to be built on an archeological site must be
       approved by the Puerto Rico Institute of Culture.


       Phase I is initiated, and an inspector inspects the site at a cost of USD 100.00.
       If anything is found, Phase I-a starts, and the associated fee is USD 250.00,
       and so forth.


       Assuming that the site is not archaeological (as in the Doing Business case
       study), the fees for this procedure would only be USD 100.00. This procedure
       is a prerequisite for obtaining the nal occupancy permit. Since this is a
       parallel process, it can be simultaneous with the previous one.

   9   Request and obtain re recommendations from Authorized Professional                  5 days    USD 300
       and Inspector
       Agency : Authorized Professional and Inspector

       The Regulations of Construction Permits for Works and Land Use
       “Reglamento Conjunto de Permisos para Obras de Construcción y Usos de
       Terrenos” published in December 2010 introduces the option of hiring an
       Authorized Professional (AP) and Authorized Inspector (AI). Construction
       companies in Puerto Rico can now choose between hiring an authorized
       professional/inspector or having a government agency carry out the re
       recommendations and the re prevention and environmental health
       certi cates.


       In 2012, the government began providing certi cation courses and since
       June 2013 most construction companies in Puerto Rico use the Authorized
       Professional and Inspector because it takes less time.


       Authorized Professionals and Inspectors charge approximately USD 250 for
       the re recommendations. Moreover, there is a ling fee of $50 for re                                       Page 14

       Once all the above steps have been completed, BuildCo can now request the
       preliminary approval (licencia condicionada), as it is conditional on BuildCo
       paying the construction tax and the workers' policy.
       This procedure is regulated by the Reglamento de Certi cación,
       Administrative Order2009-14. The OGPe grants a preliminary approval, which
       is necessary to register for the FSE and to pay the municipal tax
       (Development Right Transferral Program) on the building.

      In 2012, the government began providing certi cation courses and since
      June 2013 most construction companies in Puerto Rico use the Authorized
      Professional and Inspector because it takes less time.

      Authorized Professionals and Inspectors charge approximately USD 250 for
      the re prevention certi cate. Moreover, there is a ling fee of $80 for this
      certi cate according to “Orden Administrativa OGPe-2010-3”. They charge
      another USD 250 for the environmental health certi cate and there is a ling
      fee of $35 for this certi cate according to “Orden Administrativa OGPe-2010-
      3”.

      Each certi cate takes about 5 days to issue. As a consequence, this cannot

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      and the date and municipality in which the public deed was executed. Public
      deeds for the sale of real property must be prepared by a Notary and
      executed by the parties before the Notary. In order to prepare the public
      deed, the Notary requires a title report, usually 30 days or less before the
      execution of the public deed, which shows the status of the real property at
      the Registry of the Property, i.e., owner, mortgages, easements and other
      encumbrances. The title report will also specify whether documents have
      been recorded or are still pending recordation at the Registry of the
      Property. Notaries have new judicial powers under Act No. 282 of August 21,
      1999 ("Ley de Asuntos No Contenciosos"), nally put into e ect under new
      rules issued last year by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court (2011 TSPR 135 and
      Regulation 8021 of May 16, 2011).

      With the approval of Law 210 of December 8th 2015, a property title report
      can be performed directly without any intermediaries by examining the
      Registry of the Property records online. However, the majority of owners still
      rely on Private Title Searches to complete the report. Additionally, at the
      time of execution of the purchase-sale deed, the notary public can connect
      again online with the Registry and verify if any changes have occurred since
      the date of the title report.

      shows property tax assessments as per existing valuations.


      Since March 2016, this certi cate can be requested and retrieved online. The
      digital certi cate has the same validity as the paper certi cate, and is valid
      for 30 days.

      recorded at the Property Registry. Title insurance usually covers for any
      issue that may block the property transfer registration process, or for any
      outstanding debt or encumbrance that was not found during the due
      diligence process (or that it was not duly registered at the Property Registry).

      transaction, the identity and personal circumstances of the parties (marital
      status, legal age, profession and place of residence) or, in the case of
      juridical entities, the personal circumstances of the authorized
      representatives, when and where the deed of purchase and sale is executed
      and that it was executed in the Notary's presence. Notary fees are
      negotiated between the parties and the Notary subject to the following
      requirements of law (as prescribed by Law 43 of 2009): (i) If the purchase
      price for the property is equal to or less than $10,000, Notary fees are equal
      to $150; (ii) If the purchase price for the property is greater than $10,000 but
      not more than $5,000,000, Notary fees cannot be less than 0.5% nor more
      than 1% of the purchase price for the property; (iii) If the purchase price for
      the property exceeds $5,000,000, Notary fees are as set forth above up to
      $5,000,000 and, thereafter, are subject to negotiation between the parties.
      Other documents such as a limited liability company resolution approving
      the transaction can also be prepared by the Notary for an additional fee.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
