About KNOWLEDGE & RESEARCH
The World Bank Group’s current partnership with Malaysia is focused on knowledge-
sharing. It is centered on support for Malaysia’s vision to join the ranks of high-income
economies by 2020 through inclusive and sustainable growth, and to share its lessons with
developing countries.

In March 2016, the World Bank Group officially launched its Global Knowledge and
Research Hub in Malaysia. The Hub is the first of its kind, serving both as a field presence
in Malaysia and as a global knowledge and research hub. It focuses on sharing Malaysia’s
people-centered development expertise and creating new innovative policy research on
local, regional and global issues.

Knowledge & Research reports are flagship work emanating from the teams based in the
Malaysia Hub.

The Malaysia Development Experience Series captures key lessons from Malaysia
relevant for emerging economies in Asia, Africa and elsewhere that are transitioning out of
poverty and into shared prosperity.

Foreword
Franklin D. Roosevelt once said: “We think of our land and water and human resources not as static and
sterile possessions, but as life-giving assets to be directed by wise provisions for future days.”

Those words continue to ring true today. Land represents one of the key sources of wealth for a country
with economic, social and environmental dimensions. Transparent and efficient land administration and
management systems allow land assets to be maximized for economic growth, sustainable development,
food security and social cohesion. Providing for secure land rights is embodied in the Constitution. Land-
related investments have enabled Malaysia’s transformation over the past three decades in both the rural
and urban areas.

Realizing efficient delivery of land administration services is a strategic goal for Malaysia and for the Ministry
of Environment and Natural Resources. Providing reliable and affordable access to information on land rights
and technical cadastral aspects have allowed the land market to grow and function as an economic driver
for the country.

Malaysia offers lessons for other countries seeking to transform their economies using land. Coordination
though the National Land Council and a strong focus on consensus have facilitated technical, legal and
institutional solutions, despite the challenges that Malaysia faces with the division of responsibilities for land
administration between the State and Federal level. In addition, the adoption of digital technology for land
information has transformed service delivery, as evidenced in the World Bank Doing Business Rankings.

Malaysia moves forward to be amongst the top countries in the world in economic development, citizen
well-being, and innovation by the year 2050. The Prime Minister said recently in the Global Transformation
Forum: “The National Transformation Program aims to generate benefits for all Malaysians. It is key that no
Malaysian gets left behind; that the needs of all our people are met; and that all communities, whether large
or small, are able to contribute to and share the wealth of the country.”

In this process, a highly concerted effort between the Federal Government and the State Government
is crucial to bring about a total revamp in land administration. Gone are the days when archaic statutes
and intricate procedures were part-and-parcel of Malaysia’s land administration. Current land policies are
dynamic and visionary, trying to take into account the needs of a globalized economy.

It is an honor that the World Bank is documenting lessons from the progress Malaysia has made with reforms
for land administration. I believe the experiences and solutions will be instructive for other countries facing
many of the same issues.

     The National Land Council was set up to
     provide a mechanism for formulating national
     land policy. However, since this mechanism has
     a strong emphasis on consensus, it involves
     rigorous prior consultations between federal
     and state authorities in overcoming the
     significant gaps in land administration data and
     system integration. Cadastral and land registry
     data and systems need to be integrated
     in order to provide complete and accurate
     land administration data to both public and
     private users. The most efficient way to ensure
     seamless integration is to have a single system
     for the information under a single authority.
     In the absence of an integrated institutional
     structure, a strong coordination mechanism
     with mandatory compliance for data integration
     is critical, and has been successfully instituted
     for Malaysia.

     has developed its NSDI through guidelines
     and standards; however, there is still no
     national NSDI strategy or law. The majority of
     agencies and organizations that provide or use
     geospatial data are motivated by their own

Why is There
Global Interest
in Efficient Land
Administration?
Land and buildings generally represent between
half and three quarters of the national wealth in
all countries.
Good land policies and quality land administration services are fundamental for secure land
tenure, a well-functioning land market and sustainable management of land resources which
in turn contribute to economic growth, efficient public sector service delivery, environmental
protection, and social cohesion and security.

The importance of secure land rights and good land administration have been recognized in several
international forums and agreements including:

    •	 The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) where three of the SDGs specifically refer to secure
       land ownership and by extension highlight the need for good land administration. (see Box 1)

    •	 The 2013 Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and
       Forests of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization/ Committee on Food Security, which
       links food security to good land governance and systems. (see Box 2)

    •	 The 2014 joint World Bank-International Federation of Surveyors (FIG) publication ‘Fit for Purpose
       Land Administration’ which defines the Fit for Purpose approach to design to build sustainable land
       administration systems. (see Box 3)

Land administration 3 underpins efficient land management 4 and sustainable
development. The land administration systems in OECD countries have evolved over
long periods of time, typically over a century, usually from fairly simple systems that
operated in limited areas to sophisticated systems that cover the whole jurisdiction
and provide a comprehensive range of land administration services. Basic land
administration services consist of spatial aspects (cadastral mapping) and legal aspects
(registration of rights, responsibilities and restrictions) which, when combined, create
a land information system. More sophisticated systems expand services and link land
information systems to other key registers such as the civil, business, planning and
fiscal registers. Geospatial or location-based information further enhances the ability
to analyse and manage land related information in a 3D environment and over time
in 4D applications. These ever more sophisticated systems rely on the establishment
of a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) which are made possible through the adoption of
standards for inter-operability and data exchange between public and private users
for a variety of uses.

However, approximately 70 percent of the world’s population does not have
access to affordable systems to secure their rights. Many governments lack
even basic land information systems to secure land rights, support private sector
development or improve public sector service delivery. Common challenges
preventing developing countries from establishing systems to provide quality land
administration include complexity and costs in establishing comprehensive land
records and maps. Recent advances in surveying, mapping and ICT technologies
have made the task of addressing these challenges easier and cheaper, but the main
obstacles to providing quality land administration services typically relate to legal
hurdles, institutional fragmentation and resistance to change. There are many success
stories globally to learn from, but each country and its land tenure system is unique
and there is no universal model for land administration. Technical solutions need to
be fit-for-purpose and governance of institutions needs to be sound. Finally, high
quality land administration requires sustainable financing and institutional structures
to implement and maintain the reform and support the development of new solutions.

4    Land management is the process of managing the use and development of land resources. Some of the critical, and
     sometimes conflicting, objectives that must be addressed by land management policies today include:
       •	 improving the efficiency of land resource use to support the rapidly growing population of many countries;
       •	 providing incentives for development, including the provision of residential housing and basic infrastructure
          such as sewer and water facilities;
       •	 protecting the natural environment from degradation;
       •	 providing equitable and efficient access to the economic benefits of land and real estate markets;
       •	 supporting government services through taxation and fees related to land and improvements.

                                 Administration
        In 2014 the joint World Bank-FIG document on Fit for Purpose Land Administration was
        published. The Fit for Purpose approach is designed to build sustainable land administration
        systems. An excerpt notes:

                “The document stresses that the approach used for building land administration
                systems in less developed countries should be flexible and focused on citizens’
                needs, such as providing security of tenure and control of land use, rather than
                focusing on top-end technical solutions and high accuracy surveys. A fit-for-
                purpose approach includes the following elements:

                   •	 Flexible in the spatial data capture approaches to provide for varying use and
                        occupation.
                   •	 Inclusive in scope to cover all tenure and all land.
                   •	 Participatory in approach to data capture and use to ensure community
                        support.
                   •	   Affordable for the government to establish and operate, and for society to
                        use.
                   •	   Reliable in terms of information that is authoritative and up-to-date.
                   •	   Attainable in relation to establishing the system within a short timeframe and
                        within available resources.
                   •	   Upgradeable with regard to incremental upgrading and improvement
                        over time in response to social and legal needs and emerging economic
                        opportunities.

Why is Malaysia’s
Experience Worth
Learning From?

Peninsular Malaysia offers several examples of
programs and initiatives that have led to improved
land administration system and services.
Other developing countries may find the Malaysian experience instructive since it is a relatively large
country that has implemented a series of reforms to transform from a low to a middle income country
in a relatively short time period. Malaysia may offer more relevant examples of reforms than small city
states such as Singapore or Hong Kong, or developed nations like New Zealand.

Malaysia performs well for land administration globally. It ranks 42 out of 190 jurisdictions in the ease
of registering property in the annual World Bank Doing Business ranking, which is a good assessment
in relation to other countries in the region (see Figure 1). The Doing Business Report notes that steps to
increase this ranking would be those that reduced the number of procedures and the time necessary to
register a transaction. The ranking for the quality of land administration is also high at 27.5 out of a maximum
of 30 points, with points lost due to the separate cadastral and registration databases, the lack of publicly
available statistics on transactions and the lack of a mechanism to compensate those acting in good faith
who suffered losses without going to the courts.

Peninsular Malaysia’s success in land administration can be contributed to several factors. One
example is the introduction of a simplified process to complete the systematic registration of land in the
country. The government introduced the concept of qualified titles in the legal framework to remove the
requirement of a formal, accurate cadastral survey for registration. Allowing registration based on qualified
title reduced the time and cost of registration, resulting in a successful initial registration campaign that
strengthened land tenure security and facilitated development of the formal land market. The government
has subsequently introduced programs to upgrade qualified title to final title. The introduction of qualified
titles with eventual upgrading to final titles is a good example of fit-for-purpose land administration
principles and can be considered a valuable methodology to quickly register land rights and boost land
market activity.

A second example is the investment in IT systems and digital data to improve service delivery.
The government has embarked on a national digital agenda covering key services and sectors of the
economy, including land administration. From clear national policy to targeted investments in IT systems
and data, Malaysia is building the necessary foundations for e-government. The investments in IT systems
are also being used to overcome some of the complex legal and institutional responsibilities for land
administration by introducing the integration of cadastral and registration information. This digital land
information system further supports advanced data management and analysis through the Malaysian
National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and other applications such as the valuation and taxation of
property. The positive results are reflected in the Doing Business rankings and general confidence of both
the public and private sector with land administration functions and services. These aspects are discussed
in more detail in Chapter 3.

          What is Land Registration and
           the Torrens Title System?
        Land registration is the official recording of legally recognized interests in land. There is no
        universal system of land registration but it is generally accepted that there are two different
        approaches, deeds registration or title registration. From a legal point of view the key difference
        between the two approaches is that under a deeds registration system the documents recorded
        in the deeds registry are the evidence of title while under a title registration system the register
        itself is the prime evidence of title. A title registration system is often supported by a state
        guarantee but this is not universal. The state guarantee supports the indefeasibility of title while
        providing a mechanism to compensate those acting in good faith who are disadvantaged by the
        operation of the title register. Typically a title registration system provides more certainty and
        requires less effort by those seeking information or dealing with property rights. With advances
        in technology and the application of this technology to tasks such as the computerization of
        deeds and other records, production of digital maps, linking the textual and spatial data in the
        registry and providing online access to data and information, the difference between the two
        approaches is blurring. Generally the move in any significant upgrade to a land registration
        system is to title registration but very efficient and reliable deeds registration systems operate
        in many countries, including South Africa and the Netherlands. Regardless of the approach, it
        must be recognized that there are many forms of both deeds and title registration systems.

        The Torrens title system was introduced by Sir Robert Torrens in South Australia in 1858 as a
        system to record property rights that was significantly simpler than the traditional system under
        English land law of proving a chain of title through a series of deeds. Under the Torrens title
        system a registered proprietor holds an indefeasible title ‘subject to such mortgages charges,
        leasehold or other lesser estates as may exist or be created affecting the land.’ (Torrens R,
        Gawler H, 1859:9). Ruoff (1957:8), lists the three principles that apply to the Torrens title system:

          •	 The Mirror Principle where the register accurately and completely reflects the current facts
             that are material to the title.

          •	 The Curtain Principle where the register is the sole source of information for those
             investigating the title.

          •	 The Insurance Principle under which those who suffer loss caused by private fraud or by
             errors made by the staff in the registry receive compensation.

        Torrens title has been widely adopted by jurisdictions administered by Britain. Torrens title was
        introduced in Malaysia by the British and is the tenure system implemented under the National
        Land Code. However in Malaysia the principle of insurance is not applied.

Qualified Titles
Qualified titles are a mechanism to quickly                                 the fact that the spatial data for qualified titles was

The land registration systems that were established                         Despite the less accurate mapping associated with
prior to the formation of Malaysia required the                             qualified titles, they have been accepted and trusted
preparation of accurate survey plans. There was a                           by land owners, government institutions and the
limited number of qualified surveyors in the country                        private sector, including financial institutions which

to address this constraint the NLC introduced the                           Over time, the government has introduced
issuance of either final titles or qualified titles. The                    programs and requirements to upgrade qualified
NLC specifies that qualified titles can be issued for                       titles to final title. In 1990 the NLC was amended

and a qualified title cannot be sub-divided or                              where the linear misclosure of the computation is
consolidated.10 A qualified title is converted to a                         not less than one part in four thousand.13 Qualified

The introduction of a process that combines                             task force for conversion of qualified titles to
qualified titles with final titles offers a good                        final titles, there has been little pressure from
example of Fit-for-Purpose land administration                          land owners or land market actors to convert

over time. The qualified title approach adopted in                      in the national cadastral map managed by JUPEM
Malaysia facilitated rapid registration and secured                     at the Federal level. Thus, the duality between
land rights, and the subsequent final title process                     Federal and State land information and systems
has facilitated upgrading and combining the                             remains and there is not a single, definitive map

Investment in IT systems, digital data and business
process re-engineering
Malaysia has also been progressively introducing digital land record management and other
technologies for land administration. For cadastral data, JUPEM has invested in the technical infrastructure
to create accurate digital maps and manage cadastral data using modern technologies. Cadastral surveys are
recorded in the national cadastral map series based on the national geodetic datum. JUPEM implemented
a geodetic adjustment in 200014 and has established a Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS)
network with 72 stations that provide Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data to support a wide
range of precise survey and positioning needs and has plans to increase this network. Accurate positioning
is necessary to allow precise measurements for development of the NSDI, spatial data integration and
applications such as 3D modelling.

Business process re-engineering has been essential in improving service delivery. In 2010 Malaysia
was ranked 86 in registering property with a property transfer taking 144 days and this ranking spurred
JKPTG into a major business process re-engineering exercise.15 Among the initiatives introduced was the
“single piece flow” which was an adaptation of factory production line procedures. JKPTG led a team to
re-engineer the processes. The old practice of moving documents in one bundle from one point to another
was stopped and a new system introduced to move each application from station to station. A checklist of
relevant documentation was introduced and a public awareness campaign undertaken. In four months the
land administration system managed to register 61.12 percent of property transfers on Peninsular Malaysia in
2 days. Improved record handling systems were also introduced and this greatly reduced the effort required
by staff to access and check archived records. The obligatory use of the Malaysia identity card (MyKad) and
thumbprint readers were introduced in all land offices as a means of reducing fraud and forgery.

28                                         Enhancing Public Sector Performance: Malaysia’s Experience with Transforming Land Administration
                                                                                          Chapter 3. Malaysia’s Land Administration: A Primer




For land registers, JKPTG provides oversight for the registration system that is implemented by
the State authorities on Peninsular Malaysia. There have been five stages in technical evolution of land
administration systems in Malaysia and a planned sixth stage, as shown in Figure 3:

     1.	 Prior to the 1980s: Manual land title registration supported by manual cadastral systems with hard-
         copy maps and card indices;

     2.	 1980’s: Introduction of computerization with the creation of the first digital cadastral databases,
         electronic indices and Land Revenue Collection System (SHTB);

     3.	 1995: Introduction of computerized land registration systems (SPTB) in all State land registries on
         Peninsular Malaysia;

     4.	 Early 2000’s: The introduction of web-enabled land administration systems with the integration of
         different government functions such as planning, taxation, land development and local government.
         Examples included e-Cadastre and Modernized Land Administration System (SPPT);

     5.	 2005: The introduction of a web-based land titles system e-Tanah (e-Land) linking SHTB and CLRS in
         Penang, followed by Malacca and planned for expansion in Kuala Lumpur (KL);

     6.	 The development and implementation of iLand planned from 2020 as a vision of integrated, spatially
         enabled land information available on the internet.


The development of the ICT systems such as CLRS has been a key strategy in standardizing the
systems used and in improving the quality of the land administration services provided by the States.
CLRS is operating in all State land registries on Peninsular Malaysia and it is this software that provides the
basis for the strong ranking under the Doing Business Report documented above. Nevertheless, the system
does have a number of problems and JKPTG has been promoting the development and implementation of
a new digital system called e-Tanah (e-Land) to addresses these issues. The drivers for the development of
e-Tanah have included: (i) a large and unwieldy volume of paper records; (ii) increasing use of technology by
both the public and private sectors; (iii) concern about the delays in manual registration processes; and (iv)
the demand from users for greater spatial accuracy.

The concept of e-Tanah has been developed with a public portal that includes:

     1.	 Customer Service (services and procedures, enquire online, complain, check status and seek help);

     2.	 e-Carian (e-Search) focussed on Private Title Search as specified in section 384 of the Land Code; and

     3.	 e-Pembayaran (e-Payment) for the payment of quit rent16 online, uploading of payments to State
         e-Commerce facilities, processing of credit card payments and checking the status of quit rent
         payments/arrears.




16 Quit rent is a form of property tax imposed on owners of both freehold and leasehold land, paid yearly to the relevant land office of each State
   Government.

The key concept behind further development of e-Tanah is to integrate land registry data with other
core systems. These systems include e-Kadaster; MyGDI, and e-Stamping, and future enhancements are
planned including e-Dealings and e-Lodgements. The software system will also facilitate the integration of
the registration data with other key data sets including the national cadastral map series which is maintained
federally by JUPEM.

However, the development of e-Tanah has taken longer than planned and has not been accepted by all
State governments. While various versions of e-Tanah have been developed and implemented in Penang
and Malacca, neither investment has resulted in a system that other States are prepared to adopt. Although
e-Tanah is being developed under the coordination of the National Land Council, States have autonomy
in adopting the software. The perception from one State government, for example, raises concerns about
aspects of the e-Tanah as implemented in Malacca and Penang, including concerns about compliance with
customer requirements and the fact that the strata records are still maintained manually.17 Land registration

with the close interaction with the State governments to ensure that the software system meets the needs
of the States and is in a form that can readily be customized. In 2016, the Federal government launched
a PPP arrangement for development of the new e-Tanah system. This approach is relatively new for land
administration systems, with only a few examples available globally. PPPs offer the opportunity to attract
private sector funding for land registration services, thereby reducing the burden on public sector financing
especially for developing and maintaining an IT infrastructure and the necessary qualified personnel.
However, it is important that the PPP is properly structured with an appropriate balance in risks and rewards.
It is important that the government retains the rights to the data and ensures that the fees and charges
for land administration services are affordable and not a barrier to participation particularly by those less
well off. The experience in Ontario demonstrates that it is possible to establish a strong partnership with a
private sector partner with strong finances and a focus on the long-term rather than short-term such as an
agency that funds pensions.

Malaysia has experience and a well-established institutional structure for administering PPPs. Since
1983 the Public Private Partnership Unit under the Prime Minister's Department (UKAS) has administered
over 800 PPPs, mainly for infrastructure projects such as ports, roads, airports, and large land developments.
More recently ICT projects are coming under the PPP framework. For the e-Tanah system UKAS set up a
Committee chaired by the Director General and with representatives from key agencies including Treasury,
MAMPU (e-government), JKTPG and EPU (the Economic Planning Unit responsible for capital investments).
The Committee and project team under JKTPG are holding user consultations with the States and other
stakeholders to ensure their requirements are included. The project progress is reported to the National
Land Council and in the Chief Ministers meetings.

While the details of the e-Tanah PPP are not publicly available, a few key elements have emerged. The
PPP is structured as a 14-year concession, with the operator having 2 years for system development and 12
years to maintain the system, provide services and make a return on the investment. The Contractor is also
providing the hardware and software but the system will be installed in a government data warehouse with
a government disaster recovery system. The contractor is also responsible for converting any paper based
records and for regular training and capacity building.

The contractor will develop the core system and provide the source code to Government so that the
software can then be customized according to the requirements of individual States. The contractor
is required to update the technology twice over the course of the concession (“technology refresh”) and is
required to develop 9 modules based on the competencies of the State land registry: registration, strata,
revenue, consent, disposal, development, enforcement, state land acquisition, and auction in case of
foreclosure. The mapping system, e-Kadaster, will remain a separate system under JUPEM that will be linked
with the new e-Tanah along with other external systems such as inland revenue systems, courts, and bailiffs.

The financing of the PPP is based on an analysis of current transactions and revenue, cash-flow
requirements and the lifespan of the ICT investment. The land offices will continue to collect fees from
the citizens and the contractor will get payment from the government based on an agreed portion of the
transaction fees and a regular fee/title to maintain the data. The Federal Government is covering the cost of
the system design. At the end of the concession period the system will be transferred back to Government.
The new e-Tanah database will include the historical land registration data and the data will remain in
Government ownership. The system is expected to be piloted in Kuala Lumpur in 2017 and then rolled out
to other States, including an upgrade to the existing e-Tanah systems in Penang and Malacca.

                     What is National Spatial
                      Data Infrastructure?
        Geospatial information (GI) has played an increasingly important role over the last two decades
        in supporting effective decision making to address social, environmental and economic issues.
        Location is a critical piece of information because everything that takes place in the world happens at
        some location, however that is described – for example by an image, map co-ordinates, or an address.
        Location provides a common link to different activities and statistics relating to the same place, and allows
        different datasets to be combined, viewed, compared, and analyzed. Being able to access up to date,
        definitive and reliable GI allows decision makers to see where resources, infrastructure and people are
        located, and the environment they are in.

        However, having access to such information and using it for evidence based decision making is by
        no means the norm; many countries lack the types or quality of GI needed, and even where it does
        exists, it can be difficult to find out what is available, whether it is fit-for-purpose, how to access
        it, who owns it, or how to use it. Facilitating such an environment often needs a degree of central or
        “top down” co-ordination, and the result is a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), or where this is organized
        over a whole country, a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). (Kelm et al, 2017:1).

        Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is a concept that facilitates and coordinates the exchange and
        sharing of spatial data and services (Harvey et al 2012:23). When organized at the national level SDI
        is referred to as NSDI. SDI is an infrastructure that provides a policy framework, access technologies and
        standards (Williamson et al 2010:229).

        The concept of SDI was developed in the 1990s and has evolved through several iterations. Early
        SDI initiatives focused on data and data accessibility. Later initiatives evolved to consider product-based
        approaches and more recently SDI initiatives have shifted to more of a user-oriented approach with a
        focus on the management of data and applications. Regional efforts, such as those of the European Union
        to create the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) create regional SDIs. In reviewing
        future trends in geospatial information management the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global
        Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) foresee:
         •	 A focus on citizen services, better land management and the sustainability of services
         •	 An increasing trend to bring together data from multiple sources including official statistics, geospatial
            data, satellite data, big data and crowd-sourced data
         •	 Data availability is changing with a huge increase in the tracking and availability of real-time data – data
            is no longer just for mapping and delivery but for integration, analytics, modeling and aggregation
         •	 Governments are moving towards being commissioners of information rather than creating it
            themselves.

        The main benefits of creating effective NSDI include:
         •	 Better planning, management and monitoring of activities by Government at all levels
         •	 Supporting the creation of e-Government services for citizens that are cost-effective, efficient,
            accessible and transparent
         •	 Avoiding the costly duplication of effort in establishing systems and procuring data by establishing a
            single authoritative version of each core dataset
         •	 Providing datasets for all sectors to support their economic and social activities and for the
            development of new services.

                        Qualified Titles
                        Qualified titles provide a rapid, fit for purpose means to register land and facilitate
                        the land market. The introduction of qualified titles in the Land Code was a successful
                        mechanism to overcome key constraints in the national program to expand systems to
                        formally record land rights, particularly the limited number of licensed surveyors and the
                        time and costs associated with completing accurate cadastral surveys. Qualified Titles
                        provided a mechanism to register land quickly and it was used on significant scale by
                        State and private developers. The success can be linked to the fact that both qualified
                        and final titles were clearly specified in national legislation, the procedures and systems
                        used to register both types of titles were largely the same and there is a clear process to
                        convert qualified title to final title. While the early process to issue qualified title based
                        on sketches prepared by non-surveyors created some issues for land administrators
                        (for example the sketches do not provide precise measurements) it had little negative
                        impact on the perception by the public and the market about the security of tenure, as
                        evidenced by stable market prices and the willingness of banks to provide mortgages
                        using the qualified titles to land as collateral. Over time the standards and processes
                        for cadastral surveys have been improved and a special task force for the conversion of
                        qualified titles to final title has been introduced and is largely successful. Introducing
                        qualified titles to quickly register land is a good model for countries with limited capacity
                        or qualified surveyors.



                        ICT Solutions and Data Integration
                        Data integration can be used to overcome complex institutional mandates and
                        using ICT solutions for improved service delivery. The introduction of ICT solutions for
                        land administration has facilitated two related improvements for service delivery. Firstly,
                        system and data integration will help to overcome the complex division of responsibility
                        between the federal and state governments for cadastre and land registration. When
                        it is not possible to introduce institutional reforms and combine the functions for the
                        cadastre and land registry under a single authority, then data and service integration
                        can be a suitable solution.

                        Secondly, service delivery can be improved by introducing digital data and systems.
                        JKPTG has been able to implement significant improvements through the development
                        of ICT systems such as CLRS and plans for further improvements in the development
                        of e-Tanah. The effectiveness of these improvements is reflected in the Doing Business
                        Ranking. The introduction of e-Tanah and the development of clear interfaces to other
                        systems, particularly e-Kadaster, will improve services and help generate the spatial and
                        textual data that Malaysia needs to successfully implement the NSDI.

                        Data integration allows for improved applications using land and real property
                        information. One example is for property valuation and taxation. Malaysia has a long
                        history in terms of applying a tax on real property. Known as ‘rates,’ it is one of the

most important sources of revenue for local governments. While the majority of local
governments in Malaysia still use a manual approach to the valuation of properties, the
use of automated valuation methods using integrated land administration information
is increasing within the larger local governments. However most local governments
in Malaysia have not been able to update their valuation lists and the Department of
Valuation and Property Services Malaysia (JPPH) has limited capacity to support local
governments. In 2014 the recurrent property tax in Malaysia only contributed about
0.5 percent of GDP compared to the about 1 percent collected in OECD countries. The
development and implementation of a national taxation policy for local government
could provide the basis for increased property tax collection. The revision of the Local
Government Act of 1976 and a shift in the basis of valuation for the rating system would
be key elements in this new policy as would be support for the implementation of
computer assisted mass appraisal (CAMA).



Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
The PPP model for land administration systems offers a new approach for land
administration data and system integration. Due to the limited acceptance of
the current e-Tanah system by States, the Federal government has launched a pilot,
using a PPP arrangement, for development of the new e-Tanah system. This approach
is relatively new for land administration systems, with only a few examples available
globally. Malaysia has experience and a well-established institutional structure for
administering PPPs under UKAS. While the majority of PPPs have been for infrastructure,
ICT projects are also coming under the PPP framework. Malaysia combines the PPP
contract management experience of UKAS with the subject matter input from the
relevant technical agencies through the project Committee. The Committee and project
team are holding user consultations with stakeholders to ensure their requirements are
included and project progress is reported to both the National Land Council and in the
Chief Ministers meetings. While the results and success of the PPP for land administration
has yet to be assessed, the government has put in place the management, stakeholder
coordination, monitoring and reporting mechanisms that have been the structure of
other PPPs in the country.



National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)
There is a sound basis for development of the NSDI in Malaysia. A dedicated
institution for NSDI has been set up which provides clear coordination and management
functions through secretariats, steering committees, and working groups. The NSDI
activities have been aligned to the e-Government agenda, and there is an open data
initiative. Substantial work has been undertaken to develop technology, formulate
policies, prepare guidelines and develop and disseminate standards in support of data
inter-operability. Malaysia is one of the countries that is continuously working towards a

                        fully-fledged digital community and government, investing in a strong ICT infrastructure
                        to manage data and link systems and information. Several systems have been developed
                        and implemented using spatial based information with accurate mapping, framework
                        data, metadata, and a geoportal to provide a single access point. Also, the Malaysian
                        Government encourages geospatial information research and development by making
                        annual grants available for innovative applications and solutions.



                        Policy and inter-agency coordination
                        Strong national level coordination is needed to manage complex institutional
                        arrangements for land administration. Malaysia is a Federal state and under the
                        Constitution, land is a State matter. The Land Code for Peninsular Malaysia was formulated
                        by the Federal government under its powers to make laws for the purpose of uniformity
                        but the States retain significant powers in land matters. Land rights on Peninsular
                        Malaysia are recorded in State Land Offices. However, at the federal level JUPEM is
                        responsible for undertaking cadastral surveys and managing the cadastral map series.
                        The separate legal basis for land tenure and land administration in Sabah and Sarawak
                        further complicates the matter. In an attempt to ensure coordination between the federal
                        and State agencies and institutions responsible for land administration, the National
                        Land Council was set up to provide a mechanism for formulating national land policy.
                        The National Land Council enjoys high level leadership and has representatives from
                        the state and federal level. However, since this mechanism places a strong emphasis on
                        consensus, it involves rigorous prior consultations between federal and state authorities
                        in overcoming the significant gaps in land administration data and system integration.

                        In order to benefit fully from a NSDI, efforts are needed to move beyond policies and
                        standards. The majority of agencies and organizations that provide or use geospatial
                        data are motivated by their own mission and do not necessarily subscribe to national
                        policy objectives. Over the past decades Malaysia has developed its NSDI through
                        guidelines and standards and the NSDI institution has been established. However, there
                        is still no national NSDI strategy or law. While the NSDI agency is preparing a Geo Master
                        Plan with a 10-year strategy (2017-2027) and a draft law to support NSDI, approval and
                        implementation require further time and political support. Adopting an NSDI law will
                        provide further basis for coordination around national-level objectives.

                        Data sharing and exchange are important prerequisites for efficient land
                        administration. Aside from agencies being motivated by their own mission, sharing
                        information in a fully transparent manner is not the main characteristic of the Malaysian
                        administrative culture. While Malaysia has made some progress toward readiness for
                        open data, 20 inter- and intra-agency communication is still linked to hierarchy and
                        authority. As a result, information exchange is limited. The GMP will have to develop clear
                        strategies to overcome these critical cultural and institutional barriers to the successful
                        implementation of NSDI in Malaysia and the socio-economic benefits need to be fully
                        recognized, discussed and quantified.

                           The following key strengths from the experience in Malaysia provide important
                           lessons for other countries:

                                a)	The issuance of qualified titles with a lower standard for spatial definition can be
                                   an effective means of implementing systematic registration where the qualified
                                   titles and any subsequent dealings with these titles are managed in the same
                                   system that registers full or unqualified titles.

                                b)	Business-Process Re-Engineering is an effective tool to make significant changes
                                   to service delivery. When implemented with strong political support it provides
                                   the means to break down strong ‘silos’ in systems that have evolved over long
                                   periods of time.

                                c)	 ICT tools can be effective in standardizing processes, improving service delivery
                                    and making spatial and textual data available for broader use in government and
                                    society.

                                d)	In a complex institutional environment there should be a clear, authoritative
                                   mechanism to formulate and implement land policy. This is particularly so where
                                   there is the need to ensure that the rights of the vulnerable such as indigenous
                                   groups are protected.

                                e)	PPPs offer an innovative business model for governments to consider but
                                   due consideration needs to be made around the governance of the design,
                                   contracting, implementation, monitoring and impact because ensuring secure
                                   property rights and a well-functioning land market are a cornerstone for
                                   economic development and social stability.

                           Learning of Malaysia’s limitations can be instrumental as well:

                                f)	 When possible, it is advisable to avoid complex national/state division of the
                                    cadastre and land registry. Cadastral and land registry data and systems need
                                    to be integrated in order to provide complete and accurate land administration
                                    data to both public and private users. The most efficient way to ensure seamless
                                    integration is to have a single system for the information under a single authority.
                                    In the absence of an integrated institutional structure, a strong coordination
                                    mechanism with mandatory compliance for data integration is critical.

                                g)	An effective NSDI requires a clear policy and legal framework in order to define
                                   the roles and responsibilities of data suppliers and users. While governments
                                   may choose to start NSDI development prior to a formal policy and legal
                                   framework, developing a mature and efficient SDI requires clear manadates,
                                   roles and responsibilities for all parties.
