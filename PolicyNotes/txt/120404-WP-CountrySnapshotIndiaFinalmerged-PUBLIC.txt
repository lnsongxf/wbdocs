     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of India launched the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to provide children 6 to 14 years old with universal access to education, bridge gender and social category
     gaps in elementary education and improve the quality of learning in schools. The World Bank operation is now supporting the implementation of the third phase of SSA. It focuses
     on four key development objectives: improving attendance rates; improving retention rates; improving transition rates from primary to upper primary level; and enhancing and
     monitoring learning levels. The World Bank’s support seeks to ensure equitable participation from all sections of society; including girls, Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, Scheduled
     Caste (SC) students and Children with Special Needs (CWSN).
     The World Bank is supporting the entire program and is financing about 4 percent of it while focusing on three key thrust areas: improving quality for enhancing learning
     outcomes; strengthening monitoring and evaluation for enhanced accountability; and enhancing access and retention for disadvantaged children.
     Support for SSA has been structured through a programmatic Sector Wide Approach focused on monitoring and reporting sector-wide results; ensuring collaboration between the
     Bank, GOI, and Development Partners; and improving education for underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. Key features of the approach are:
     ■■      Access to the entire government program and monitoring program results jointly with the GOI to harmonize Bank and GOI fiduciary systems and safeguards requirements,
             which has strengthened the SSA’s financial sustainability.
     ■■      A strong joint review and feedback mechanism with mandatory, transparent disclosure of program information.
     ■■      Introducing a strong focus on quality by developing grade-level learning indicators, focusing on early grade reading and math and on science and mathematics at upper
             primary level and making teacher training more relevant to classroom needs.
     ■■      Help to secure disadvantaged children greater access to quality education;
     Establishment of local School Management Committees to empower local communities, alongside social accountability measures like community driven development of schools
     and school assessment.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■      143 million direct beneficiaries (students enrolled in government managed or government aided schools) out of which 50.7 percent are girls;
     ■■      Retention rate for students studying in primary grades has improved from 75.6 percent in 2012 to 84.2 percent in 2016;
     ■■      Transition rate between primary and upper primary levels improved from 86.7 percent in 2012 to 90.1 percent in 2016;
     ■■      During 2015-16, about 70 percent of teachers received in-service training support; and since 2012, more than 60 percent of head teachers have received school leadership
             training;
     ■■      Between 2012 and 2016, the percent of CWSN enrolled (against the number identified) has improved from 77 percent to about 96 percent;
     ■■      Teacher attendance rates have improved from 75 percent in 2011-12 to about 85 percent in 2015-16;
     ■■      SC, ST, OBC and Muslim students share in enrolment exceeds these groups’ share in the overall population;
     ■■      Government has positioned learning outcomes as a frontline agenda - released grade specific learning indicators for elementary education and restructured the National
             Achievement Survey to have better quality test items, a more representative sample size and facilitate better analysis.
     ■■      India has decided to participate in PISA Based Test for Schools in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with a view to preparing the system for the country’s participation in PISA 2021.
     ■■      The MHRD and MWCD have issued a joint letter encouraging states to collocate ICDS centers on government school premises. This marks the beginning of a shift towards
             convergence where the state and district level education institutions/functionaries and school teachers will support ICDS centers with a view to improving the quality of Early
             Childhood Education (ECE)..

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Tuberculosis (TB), long associated with poverty, crowding and poor living conditions, remains a significant source of suffering in India with an estimated 2.2 million new cases
    and 270,000 deaths annually. At the same time, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is difficult and expensive to diagnose and treat, is a threat with estimates as high as
    64,000 new cases a year. The nation’s Revised National TB Control Program has successfully ensured coverage of first-line TB services across the country and provides diagnosis
    and treatment to about 1.5 million TB patients annually. India’s National Strategic Plan for TB Control seeks to further expand access to effective diagnosis and treatment, expand
    collaboration with the private sector, and scale up services for MDR-TB. This is the third World Bank operation to support India’s TB program since 1998.

    The project development objective is to support India’s National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Control in expanding quality diagnosis and treatment services for TB sufferers.

    Components include:
    ■■     New strategies to reach more tuberculosis patients with earlier and more effective treatment in the public sector: Supporting existing strategies for treatment of drug sensitive
           and drug resistant TB in the public sector. This will be primarily through the financing of first and second line TB drugs and; b) Rolling out daily regimen therapy for drug
           sensitive TB in five states of India.
    ■■     Scale up and improve diagnosis of tuberculosis: Improve diagnosis of drug sensitive TB. This will be primarily through financing of enhanced microscopes to revamp equip-
           ment across Designated Microscopy Centers and; b) Expansion of access to Drug Sensitivity Testing (DST).
    ■■     Improve RNTCP management capacity with Implementation of Drugs and logistical module of e-Nikshay and establishing drug resistance surveillance in 30 laboratories
           using e-Niskay.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    Increased the number of people receiving TB treatment in accordance with the World Health Organization-recommended “Directly Observed Treatment Strategy” from 2.4 million
    to 4.9 million towards a target of 6.2 million by the end of the project.
    ■■     Supporting transition to a more effective and easier to follow treatment regimen starting with 5 pilot states in early 2017 with a view to scaling up nationally after the end
           of the project.
    ■■     Increased the number of drug resistant TB patients initiated on treatment from 12,805 to 35, 370 with a goal of 50,000 by end of project.
    ■■     Increased access to DNA-based diagnostic technology from 70 to 628 districts.
    ■■     Increased the number of TB suspects and patients tested for drug-sensitivity from 130, 244 to 679,058
    ■■     Increased the number of HIV positive patients initiated in preventive TB therapy from 0 to 92,751 patients with a goal of 150,000 by end of project.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Recognizing the importance of supplying uninterrupted quality electricity to all consumers, Government of India (GOI) and the state governments have undertaken a joint
     initiative named 24X7 Power for All (PFA). The state of Andhra Pradesh is one of the first states to prepare a PFA plan and sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with GOI
     to launch the ‘Power for All’ scheme from October 2, 2014 in the state. Among other things, the key interventions that the PFA plan for Andhra Pradesh includes: a) Additional
     energy requirement for providing 24x7 power supply to all households in the state through adequacy of generation (including renewable energy plan & energy efficiency plan of
     the state); b) Adequacy of power transmission & distribution systems in the states, especially to meet additional demand, and c) Interventions for improving operational efficiency
     and improving customer satisfaction through Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) loss reduction, introducing modern technologies to provide reliable electricity supply
     The current World Bank project aims to support the implementation of the PFA plan in the state of Andhra Pradesh, in the areas of transmission and distribution network augmentation
     and strengthening, leading to increased ability to service to meet growing demand, reduction in AT&C losses, and improvement in system reliability. The development objective
     of the project is to increase the delivery of electricity to customers and to improve the operational efficiency and system reliability in distribution of electricity in selected areas in
     Andhra Pradesh.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■     The increase in electricity supply in the state of Andhra Pradesh from baseline 50,366 (GWh) in FY16 (year ending 31st March, 2016) to 74,000 (GWh) by June, 2022
     ■■     Reduction in AT&C losses and distribution transformer failure rate in select districts of Kurnool and Anantapur
     ■■     Improving the reliability of electricity as measured by standard reliability indices (SAIDI/SAIFI) in select urban towns such as Vishakhapatnam and Vijayawada
     ■■     Improving the implementation of IT systems for commercial operations and capital project implementation.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    For India, leveraging urbanization is central to its efforts in alleviating poverty and promoting shared prosperity, as India’s rapid economic growth is accompanied
    by an unprecedented spatial transformation. Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana are among the more urbanized states in India and meeting the development
    challenges of and leveraging urbanization are important priorities for them. As per Census 2011, AP has a population of about 49.4 million and an urbanization rate
    of 30% while Telangana has a population of 35.3 million with an urbanization rate of 39%. Like many states across the country, they face fundamental challenges in
    managing urbanization and providing for adequate services to a growing urban population: housing, water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid waste management,
    and transportation. In the 1980s, the Bank funded projects with the Hyderabad Water Board in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and this project, APTMDP is the Bank’s
    first recent re-engagement in the urban sector with the states of AP and Telangana.
    The Project Development Objective (PDO) of APPMDP is to help improve urban services in the state, and build the capacity of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to sustain and
    expand urban services in the two states. Urban service improvements are chosen in a demand-driven manner and implemented by ULBs, subject to several access
    and performance criteria, and with necessary technical support. The project supports improvements in the financial, technical, and management capacities of all ULBs
    through technical assistance. The project will also support improvements in the state-level framework that defines ULBs’ autonomy, accountability, and incentives for
    performance, as well as the government of AP’s capacity to monitor ULBs’ performances and to provide policy and technical support for their development.
    APTMDP has four main components:
    ■■     State-level policy and institutional development support: To improve the state’s policy and institutional framework to support service delivery and capacity
           building by ULBs.
    ■■     Municipal capacity enhancement: To enhance the financial and technical capacity, and operating systems of ULBs.
    ■■     Urban infrastructure investment: To finance sustainable, high-priority investments identified by ULBs to improve urban services or operational efficiency.
    ■■     Project management technical assistance: To ensure the quality of subproject preparation, implementation, and monitoring.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     About $340 million of urban sub-projects have been prepared and are being taken up for implementation across 14 participating ULBs in AP and Telangana.
    ■■     Over 1.2 million urban residents are expected to receive improved urban services as a result of interventions under the project.
    ■■     Over 100 participating ULBs with new municipal e-governance systems for improved citizen interface and transparency expected by close of project across AP
           and Telangana.
    ■■     Over 50 participating ULBs with new GIS Maps for improved urban planning expected by close of project across AP and Telangana.
    ■■     Training of urban sector staff has started, and over 2,000 staff has already received training against a project target of 500 across AP and Telangana.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Andhra Pradesh is one of India’s most progressive states. Its economic, social, health, and education indicators are better than the national average, and on par Andhra Pradesh is
     one of India’s most progressive states. Its economic, social, health, and education indicators are better than the national average, and on par with neighboring states of Karnataka,
     Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Road transport accounts for more than 80 percent of the state’s freight and passenger traffic. The government’s Vision 2020 strategy recognizes that an
     efficient transport system is a necessary foundation for agricultural and industrial growth, and consequently for achieving its economic growth and poverty reduction goals. The
     capacity and quality of the state’s core road network has improved considerably in recent years, and although maintenance spending has increased, it is still not adequate. In
     2004-05, the government spent about Rs.3.7 billion on maintaining existing road assets, significantly short of the Finance Commission’s standard of Rs.5.68 billion for road
     maintenance. During the course of implementation of the project, the state was bifurcated (in 2014) into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and accordingly, the project has been
     restructured to divide the activities and loan expenditure and balance amount across these two states.

     The project development objective is to provide better quality, capacity, and safe roads to users in a sustainable manner by enhancing the institutional capacity of the Andhra
     Pradesh and Telangana governments in the road sector. The project consists of three components:
     ■■    Road improvement includes two activities to upgrade and maintain the state’s Core Road Network (CRN).
     ■■    PPP facilitation support will strengthen the capacity of the government of Andhra Pradesh to develop selected high-density traffic corridors under Public-Private Partnership
           arrangement, via toll revenues and viability gap support from the central and state governments.
     ■■    Institutional strengthening will provide technical assistance, training, and advisory services for: (1) operationalization of Andhra Pradesh Road Development Corporation
           (APRDC); and (ii) project implementation including asset management, the Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP), and the Institutional Strengthening Action
           Plan (ISAP).
     ■■    Road safety will help the government of Andhra Pradesh develop safer road corridors by initiating measures to reduce road accidents. The Bank will help agencies undertake
           demonstration projects on selected core road network corridors; carry out an extended black-spot improvement program (geometric improvement of stretches with high
           incidence of accidents); and implement institutional and policy action plans for improving the state’s road safety responsibility framework and capacities.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     Achievements include:
     ■■    The share of the CRN in good condition increased from the baseline of 40 percent (2009) to 79 percent (as on July 2017, vis-à-vis the End-of-Project Target of 80 percent).
     ■■    Out of the 340 km of state highways envisaged to be upgraded, 266km were already brought up to bituminous layers.
     ■■    The target of improving the maintenance of 6,180 km through long-term performance-based contracts has been achieved.
     ■■    The target for facilitation of Public Private Partnerships has been achieved with two roads with a total length of 420 km and an estimated project cost of about $450 million,
           have been awarded as PPP concessions in 2010. Both these roads have been upgraded and are currently under the O&M phase.
     ■■    In one of the demo corridors located in Andhra Pradesh, notable reductions were observed in accidents and fatalities in ~140km road stretch over the past three years since
           the start of implementation of the civil works oriented interventions. Spurred by this, the Government of Andhra Pradesh is putting together a comprehensive, state-wide
           project for addressing the challenge of road safety in a more comprehensive manner.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Andhra Pradesh is one of the most natural hazard-prone states in India owing to its long coastline and geographical location. About 44 percent of the state is vulnerable to tropical
     storms, cyclones and related hazards. On October 12, 2014, a very severe cyclonic storm ‘Hudhud’ made landfall near Visakhapatnam. At landfall, the estimated maximum
     sustained surface wind speed was about 180 kmph and waves were up to 3 meters high. Visakhapatnam reported a maximum storm surge of 1.4 meters. By October 14, Hudhud
     had drifted northward and weakened over east Uttar Pradesh and the neighborhood. Hudhud and the floods that followed due to rainfall caused major damage in districts of
     Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari.
     Following a request from the Government of India, a mission of the World Bank conducted a rapid multi-sectoral assessment report of the damage and needs. The Rapid Damage
     and Needs Assessment estimated total damage and loss at about INR 132,631.30 million (equivalent $2.16 billion), of which the livelihoods sector was the most severely hit with
     recovery needs estimated to be around $ 443 million, followed by housing sector ($439 million) and the roads sector ($ 375 million).

     The ‘Andhra Pradesh Disaster Recovery Project’ (APDRP), takes into account the lessons from the ongoing National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project phase I (NCRMP–I) that has
     been supporting the Government of Andhra Pradesh since 2010, with improving their capacity to manage hydro-meteorological hazards. While restoring the damages caused by
     Hudhud, the project’s aim is to improve and enhance the resilience of public services, environmental facilities and livelihood in targeted communities and to enhance the capacity
     of the state to respond promptly and effectively to a crisis or emergency.

     Given the region’s vulnerability to cyclones and floods, the infrastructure will be designed with resilient features, solutions for shore protection and will include contingency
     planning for future disaster events. The Project has seven components: (i) Resilient electrical network ($81 million); (ii) Restoration of connectivity and shelter infrastructure ($71
     million); (iii) Restoration and protection of beach front ($44 million); (iv) Restoration of environmental services and facilities and livelihood support ($13.3 million); (v) Capacity
     Building and technical support for disaster risk management ($23.7 million); (vi) Implementation Support ($17 million) and vii) Contingent Emergency Response ($0 million). The
     investments are expected to support the recovery, improve the resilience of public services, environmental facilities and livelihood as well as enhance the capacity of State entities
     to respond promptly and effectively to a crisis or emergency.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     300,000 people covered by resilient underground electrical network
     ■■     1.75 million persons with access to restored and improved roads, shelters and access to improved beach front.
     ■■     1.73 million persons with access to restored and improved environmental services/ facilities.
     ■■     Updated design guidelines for buildings and public infrastructure with inputs from the urban vulnerability assessment and design standards study.
     ■■     The project will provide direct benefit to about 13.3 million residents of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakapatnam and East Godavari districts through improved road network.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Andhra Pradesh is a middle-income state, and has experienced significant economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years. However, the prosperity is unevenly distributed:
    the poverty ratio among the Scheduled Tribes (STs), Schedules Castes (SCs), and Muslims is quite high when compared to the rest of the population. A more equitable distribution
    of the growth (or higher shared prosperity is a key challenge.
    There are two main issues: There is an income deficit since the small and marginal farmers, especially SC and ST households, have not adequately benefitted from the potential
    growth in agriculture. This is primarily because they have not been able to take advantage of the potential benefits from sub-sectors like horticulture, livestock, and fisheries. The
    other deficit is the human development deficit, as most health and nutrition indicators are worse for SCs and STs. The income deficit and the human development deficit needed
    to be addressed jointly to ensure shared prosperity and a greater pace of poverty reduction. The project has five components:
    ■■   Value chain development: The objective of this component is to increase the income of small and marginal farmers through productivity enhancement and improved market
         access. This component will also invigorate local markets by connecting rural producers and enterprises with the rural consumers.
    ■■   Human development: The focus here is to enable the community to hold the service providers accountable for service delivery in the human development (HD) sector, as
         well as to improve HD service delivery by strengthening the existing public systems to deliver quality services. The interventions will target health, nutrition, sanitation, and
         education.
    ■■   Access to social protection services and entitlements: This component aims to improve the coverage and service delivery of social protection entitlements to the poorest
         households.
    ■■   Mission support, ICT and partnerships: ICT use especially open data systems and data analytics will be critical for the project. This component will support the missions re-
         cently launched by the government to ensure real-time analytics, open data systems and feedback-based policy development at the state level. It will also create an enabling
         ecosystem for innovation and transformation in delivering high quality last-mile services planned under the other components.
    ■■   Project implementation support: The objective of this component is to strengthen the project implementation by establishing monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL)
         systems, financial management systems, procurement management, governance and accountability systems, and knowledge management and communication.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    Expected results:
    ■■   Enhanced incomes for 250,000 producers in selected project mandals.
    ■■   Improved human development outcomes for 250,000 poor households though the adoption of appropriate health, nutrition, and sanitation behaviors.
    ■■   Enhanced access to social protection and entitlement programs for 500,000 poor households through systems that deliver improved information, enrollment, and payments.
    ■■   The beneficiaries under the project would constitute more than 50 percent of the small and marginal farmers and the SC/STs living in the target 150 mandals.
    ■■   Achievements include:
    Achievements so far:
    ■■   211,221 farmers were mobilized into 18,827 Producer Groups and 157 Producer Organizations

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of Andhra Pradesh (prior to bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) created a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Department (RWSSD) in 2007 to focus and
     expand RWSS coverage across the state. At the start of the project, about 46 percent of the rural habitations in Andhra Pradesh (rural population 55 million) were fully covered,
     with access to 40 liters per capita per day of water, and about 54 percent of rural households had individual toilets. The state was keen to gradually decentralize service delivery,
     while building the capacity of the local governments, or Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs). The project was designed to: (i) assist the state in building capacity to pursue its goal of
     increasing decentralized service delivery systems in the water and sanitation sectors; and (ii) scale up a demand-responsive approach with policy principles consistent with national
     policies. The project builds on the accumulated experience and lessons learned from Bank projects in India and across the world.
     The project, as designed originally, was planned to support RWSS programs in six districts of original Andhra Pradesh, and to help them adopt a common RWSS program and
     policies. The project, through improvements in RWSS service delivery and sustainability of assets, will contribute to achieving goal seven of the MDGs on sustainable access to
     safe drinking water and basic sanitation. After the state of Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated in June 2014, the project continued to be implemented in three districts of the new state
     of Andhra Pradesh (Visakhapatnam, Kadapa and Prakasam), and the new state of Telangana (Karimnagar, Mahabubnagar, Adilabad); with the same original objective. Later, in
     Telangana, the three districts were divided into twelve smaller districts: Karimnagar - Karimnagar, Siricilla, Jagtyal and Peddapalli; Mahbubnagar - Mahbubnagar, Nagarkurnool,
     Gadwal and Wanaparthy; Adilabad - Adilabad, Nirmal, Mancherial and Asifabad. They are all benefiting from the project.

     The project’s development objective is to assist the state government to improve rural water supply and sanitation services through progressive decentralization, community
     participation, and enhanced accountability. The project components are:
     ■■   Capacity and sector development: Supports building institutional capacity for implementing, managing, and sustaining project activities, along with sector-development
          studies to inform policy decisions.
     ■■   Infrastructure development: Supports improvements in water supply and sanitation services in the project habitations through new infrastructure or rehabilitating and
          augmenting existing schemes, integrated with source-strengthening measures and sanitation programs.
     ■■   Project implementation support: Supports setting up a project support unit for implementing the project, including establishing the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and
          sector information systems..

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:
     ■■   1.89 million people are benefiting from access to improved water service.
     ■■   About 177,000 household connections were given providing piped water supply to the rural community.
     ■■   About 9,400 toilets were built in project habitations using project funds, benefitting about 47,000 people.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Project seeks to enable citizens to access services under the state’s Right to Public Services in a timely, efficient, and accountable manner. It also seeks to ensure that citizens
    can apply for services through a Public Facilitation Center closer to where they live, particularly at the block and circle levels. Because RTPS services are used heavily by the poor, in
    order, to obtain the documentation needed to access a variety of government programs and benefits, it is expected that poorer citizens will benefit from this Project. The extension
    of RTPS to tribal areas is also expected to benefit the state’s tribal population. A secondary group of beneficiaries are the staff of departments in the Government of Assam who are

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      The state of Assam in the northeast region is rich in natural resources, but remains one of India’s low income states. Based on the classification system developed by the Finance
     Commission, Assam is identified has a special category state due to its low resource base and limited ability to mobilize its own resources for development. While Assam has
     been compliant with fiscal responsibility targets, there are several challenges that Assam faces in the execution of its budget. Efficiency in Public Financial Management (PFM)
     is seriously constrained due to outdated information systems and manual processes in expenditure management and tax administration. Passive cash and debt management
     practices have led to cash rationing and expenditure arrears and there is a need to address gaps in the procurement framework, enhance procurement capacity and scale up
     e-procurement. Govt. of Assam has identified PFM strengthening and modernization as a reform priority using information technical as a key driver.

     The Assam State Public Finance Institutional Reforms (ASPIRe) Project supports the government’s PFM reform agenda and will focus on strengthening the PFM framework,
     institutions, information systems and capacity in key departments of finance, commercial taxes and excise. It will support upgrade or development of new information systems for
     budget and expenditure management, excise revenue and residual commercial taxes outside the purview of GST. The project will also support strengthening procurement rules
     and human resource capacity in procurement, cash and debt management and in scale up of e-procurement. In addition to the targeted departments the project will also benefit
     line departments and external stakeholders through efficient processes, better service delivery and enhanced transparency.
     The development objective of the project is to contribute to improvement in the predictability and transparency in budget execution and tax administration.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:
     ■■   Improvement in transparency by enhanced public access to key budget execution reports and procurement contract awards
     ■■   A more efficient execution of the budget demonstrated by reduction in the share of discretionary expenditure in the last quarter of the financial year
     ■■   Improved efficiency in tax administration including reduction in the cost of collection of tax revenue in commercial taxes and excise departments.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Assam is one of the lower income states of India, and the gateway to the landlocked northeast region of the country. Its road network therefore has significant strategic importance
    for the economic integration of the lagging northeast with the rest of the country. About 60 percent Assam’s 38,000-km state road network, managed by its Public Works Roads
    Department (PWRD), is in poor condition due to years of low investment and lack of maintenance. Overall weak sector management has further aggravated the impact of sector
    underfunding. The PWRD needs substantial enhancements and revisions in its traditional way of doing business to improve its relatively low performance and institutional
    effectiveness. The Assam State Roads Project will carry forward and build on many sector reforms already introduced in the PWRD since 2000 through Bank-funded Rural
    Development Projects.

    The project’s development objective is to enhance the road connectivity of Assam by assisting the PWRD in improving and effectively managing its road network. The project has
    three components:

    Road improvement: Improves 500 km of priority sections of the secondary roads to enhance state connectivity and facilitate regional integration. This includes demonstration of
    new technologies to promote cost-effective, modern, climate-resilient, and environmentally friendly road construction, including pilots on innovative design and construction of
    bridges.
    Road-sector modernization and performance enhancement: Supports the implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan covering: (i) modernization of policies, engineering
    practices, and business procedures; (ii) asset management and maintenance; (iii) institutional and human resource development including development of local construction
    industry; and (iv) streamlining, standardizing, and computerizing PWRD key business processes.

    Road safety management: Supports building the road safety management capacity of related agencies through the development and implementation of a multi-sector road safety
    strategy.

    The project seeks to complement traditional road investments with technical assistance and knowledge to improve overall road sector management in Assam. This will help
    transform the PWRD into a modern road agency that adopts good practices in sector policies, strategic planning, and project and asset management. Bank support will leverage
    more than 10 ongoing road development programs; by addressing key sector issues such as maintenance, it will increase the impact of investments made under other road
    programs.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The project will help the Government of Assam bring better roads to 4.5 million rural people, mostly marginal and small farmers. It will also bring direct local employment for about
    20 million “person days.” Key expected results include:
    ■■   Improve 40% of secondary road network in good or fair condition through upgrading and rehabilitation work.
    ■■   Improved Asset Management through development of a Road Asset Management System, and maintaining the road network through performance-based maintenance or
         other system of maintenance contracting to be introduced in 50 percent of districts.
    ■■   An increase in the percentage of secondary road network in good and fair condition from 25 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2018.
    ■■   A 20 percent reduction in travel time on the project corridors.
    ■■   An increase in the safety rating of the project corridors from 10 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2018.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bihar is India’s third largest state with a population of 103 million people, of which approximately 54 million live below the poverty line. While significant resources are provided
     for social protection programs, the programs fall short of their poverty reduction potential. Program coverage is low and insufficient to address deprivation and poverty in Bihar
     due to large human resource and technical capacity gaps. Delivery mechanisms for awareness generation, enrollment, beneficiary management and benefit payments are
     inefficient, and certain groups (i.e., older people, widows, and people with disabilities) are underserved as social care service provision is practically absent. Existing monitoring
     and evaluation systems do not provide adequate support for planning and decision making and there is poor accountability in service delivery.
     The project development objective is to strengthen institutional capacity of the Department of Social Welfare and the Rural Development Department to deliver social protection
     programs and services and expand outreach of social care services for poor and vulnerable households, people with disabilities, the elderly, and widows. The project has two
     components:

     Strengthening social protection systems and capacity: Setting up core systems and building capacity of the Bihar Rural Development Society (BRDS) and the State Society for
     Ultra-Poor and Social Welfare (SSUPSW), which are the program implementation arms of the Rural Development Department and the Department of Social Welfare, respectively,
     to deliver key social-protection programs.
     Strengthening outreach and social protection service delivery: Financing construction, equipment, and staff for 101 social care service centers across all sub-divisions of the
     state to provide high-quality care, support, and rehabilitation services for older people, widows and the disabled. The component also supports pilots to improve outreach through
     mobile therapy services and tests models of community-based rehabilitation as well as innovative proposals to further improve social services.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   65 percent increase in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme coverage by August 2017.
     ■■   25 percent increase in share of vulnerable groups in total beneficiaries of social protection programs and services
     ■■   40 percent increase in resources available for these social protection programs.
     ■■   27 social care service centers operational with 11 mobile outreach and therapy vans..

     **US$ million, as of August 2016.** Community contribution agreed for Component 2: Enhancing Agricultural Productivity and competiveness


    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    On August 18, 2008, the Kosi river burst through its eastern embankment 11 km upstream of the Kosi Barrage in Nepal, 8 km north of the Indian border. This created major
    flooding in Nepal and Bihar (India) with about 3.3 million people affected in the State of Bihar alone. Approximately 600,000 acres of crops were ruined, impacting close to
    500,000 farmers. The Kosi floods were declared a national calamity by the Indian Government..

    Following the Flood, the Government of Bihar requested assistance from the Bank in two phases: i) to address the short-term needs of the flood-affected population, and ii) to
    tackle the longer term challenges of enhancing capacity to manage floods and investing in economic development. As a result, the Bihar Kosi Flood Recovery Project (BKFRP,
    P122096, US$220 million) was designed and became effective in March 2011 and subsequently the Bihar Kosi Basin Development Project (BKBDP) was initiated in consultation
    with the Government of Bihar.

    The Bihar Kosi Basin Development Project (BKBDP) aims to enhance resilience to floods and increase agricultural production and productivity in the flood-affected districts in
    the Kosi River Basin, and to improve the Government of Bihar’s capacity to respond promptly and effectively to a crisis or emergency. The project comprises the following five
    components: (i) Improving Flood Risk Management ($100 million); (ii) Enhancing Agricultural Productivity and Competitiveness ($75 million); (iii) Augmenting Connectivity
    ($177.5 million); Contingent Emergency Response ($0 million); and Implementation Support ($22.5 million).

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
    ■■         31,000 farmers to adopt improved Agriculture Technology
    ■■         34,000 hectares provided with improved irrigation and drainage services
    ■■         400 kilometers of rural roads constructed
    ■■         220 Water Resource Department staff trained to use flood management technologies
    ■■         58 new bridges constructed
    ■■         45 kilometers of embankment strengthened
    ■■         35 Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs) formed with representation of women, SC/ST and marginalized and landless farmers
    ■■         The project is expected to benefit approximately 10 million individuals in rural areas who are mostly small and marginal farmers. Approximately 48 percent of the beneficia-
               ries will be women.

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY AND KEY PARTNERS:
    The project supports the Government of Bihar that created the Bihar Aapada Punarwas Evam Purarnirman Society (BAPEPS) for implementing the project and works with other state
    agencies such as Rural Works, Road Construction and Departments of Agriculture, The Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Resource Department.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bihar is one of the faster-growing low income states of India with 34 percent of its population living below the poverty line and a per capita income of INR 13,482 which is one-third
     of the national average. About 90 percent of its 104 million population is rural. It has a significant agricultural base employing approximately 80 of the total labor force of the state,
     which however, contributes only 19 percent to the state gross domestic product. The state faces several challenges including low human capacity and livelihood opportunities, low
     productivity in agriculture, a low level of industrialization, deeply entrenched poverty and vulnerability to frequent floods. The state government is addressing these challenges
     with a prudent development strategy that aims to exploit the state’s potential for growth in the hitherto under-achieving sectors on account of inadequate road infrastructure and
     market linkages. The state government has made “road connectivity to each habitation” among its top seven priorities and established a mobility goal of bringing all parts of the
     state within five hours of travel time from the state capital.

     To achieve these objectives, Government of Bihar (GoB) launched Mukhya Mantri Gram Sampark Yojana (MMGSY) in 2013 to provide road connectivity to habitations with a
     population of 250-499 people, places which are not covered under PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, theGovernment of India-funded program to provide all-weather
     road access to all habitations in the country with a population of over 500). GoB has established three key priorities for its rural roads program: (i) to provide all-weather road
     connectivity to the remaining 49 percent of rural habitations; (ii) to preserve the existing road assets and upgrade them to acceptable standards; and (iii) to improve institutional
     effectiveness of RWD. The Bank is supporting these priorities of GoB under the MMGSY program.

     The project development objective is to improve rural road connectivity in project districts, and enhance management of rural roads in Bihar. The project has two components: (i)
     Rural Road Improvement to construct and upgrade about 2,500 km of the state rural roads core network and standalone bridges in the project district under MMGSY, including
     demonstrating new technologies to promote cost effective, climate resilient and environmentally friendly road construction and innovative bridge construction; and (ii) Asset
     Management and Institutional Effectiveness to provide knowledge support to gradually transform rural works department into a modern and high performing road agency
     through implementation of asset management plans, human resource professional development strategy, rural road safety action plan and road sector modernization plan.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■    Improved all-weather road access to economic opportunities and social services to a population of about 1.2 million
     ■■    Improved good quality road network by using innovative performance based maintenance contracts
     ■■    Improved asset management through implementation of asset management plans
     ■■    About 2,500 RWD staff, 1000 contractors and 600 classified consultants to benefit under the capacity building program
     ■■    Improved effectiveness of project expenditure resulting from using cost-effective measures in project road designs
     ■■    Road safety improvements through implementation of road safety action plan and safety audits
     ■■    Network level climate vulnerability assessment undertaken with special focus on floods

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    In Bihar, India’s most densely populated state, per capita income is less than half of the national average. Almost 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas with limited
    opportunities for self-employment, and little access to basic services. Although the state has witnessed high economic growth in recent years, absolute number of people living
    below the poverty line is still a massive 35.8 million. Without an adequate banking network, most rural poor have to borrow from extortionist moneylenders, or from relatives
    and friends to meet family expenses, often pawning tiny plots of land to repay old debts. Nearly 60 percent of the rural population is directly dependent on agriculture and allied
    activities where lack of organization hinders the mostly small and marginal farmers from accessing better inputs and higher price for their produce. There is a high prevalence
    of malnutrition and low sanitation levels. The Government of Bihar’s emerging priorities include women’s socio-economic empowerment, improved access to health, nutrition
    and sanitation services, and skill development and job placement for youth. The organization of poor rural women into strong and sustainable community institutions is a central
    strategy. Under the Bank-supported Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP) and National Rural Livelihoods Project (NRLP), nearly 3 million rural households have been mobilized
    into more than 240,000 Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and higher federations. These institutions have leveraged more than $120 million in credit from banks and delivered significant
    impact on human development outcomes. However, the extent of mobilization is still low and only 35 % of rural population is part of the institutions as compared to near
    saturation in many southern states of India. Building on the experience of the BRLP and the NRLP, the GoB plans to expand rural livelihood development activities to 300 blocks in
    Bihar through the Bihar Transformative Development Project. The project’s development objective is to diversify and enhance household level incomes and improve access to and
    use of nutrition and sanitation services among targeted households. The project has four program components:
    ■■   Community Institutional Development: Building or strengthening primary and higher level community institutions and producer organizations.
    ■■   Community Investment Funds: Transferring financial and technical resources to the community-based organizations and producer organizations.
    ■■   Access to Nutrition and Sanitation Services: Improving SHG women and SHG households’ nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation practices.
    ■■   Innovations, Partnerships and Technical Assistance: Supporting innovative pilots and partnerships with private sector organizations, govt. partners and development organi-
         zation to leverage high quality technical assistance and deliver synergistic impacts

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS OR ACHIEVED:
    Expected results:
    ■■   5 million households will be mobilized into 450,000 SHGs and higher federations while 500,000 farmers will be organized into Producer Groups and Producer Companies.
    ■■   Mobilizing $800 million in credit from banks and covering 1.7 million households under various insurance schemes.
    ■■   500,000 farmers will be reached by value chain interventions and at least 20 large Producer Companies will be promoted.
    ■■   Minimum dietary diversity for children aged 6 months-3 years, pregnant and lactating mothers will be promoted with a target to increase the number of such children and
         women by 20% over baseline.
    ■■   The project will promote adoption of better hygiene and sanitation practices by reaching out to 1.2 million SHG members through comprehensive behavior change commu-
         nication and will reduce the number of women practicing open defecation by 500,000
    Achievements to date:
    ■■   Nearly 3.5 million rural households have been mobilized into 307,000 Self-Help Groups, further federated into more than 18,353 Village Organizations and 103 Cluster
         Level Federations.
    ■■   Cumulatively, nearly $176 million has been leveraged from the banks as against the year 1 target of $70 million.
    ■■   More than 134,000 small and marginal farmers have been organized into producer organizations.
    ■■   The project has reached more than 253,000 households with modular training on Behavior Change Communication (BCC) pertaining to Health, Nutrition and Sanitation.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project supports India’s Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in piloting new conservation models that look beyond protected areas, and recognize
     the need for innovative solutions to biodiversity loss through improved coordination, capacity building, awareness generation, reskilling, and convergence of actions. Given the
     pace of land use changes and growing population pressure on protected areas, there is a real danger that the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services could reach a tipping
     point, at which there will be a failure to supply key inputs for sustaining economic growth. Coupled with this is the fact that over 100 million people are directly dependent on
     biodiversity resources for subsistence.

     The project development objective is to develop and promote new models of conservation at the landscape scale through enhanced capacity and institution-building for
     mainstreaming biodiversity conservation outcomes. The project has four components:
     ■■   Demonstration of landscape conservation approaches in two pilot sites: Investments in planning, coordination, and convergence through innovative microplans at the village
          level and landscape mapping; includes limited investments in improving habitat quality.
     ■■   Strengthening knowledge management and national capacity for landscape conservation: Development of a curriculum for a national-level landscape management course—
          strengthening three field learning centers for translating best practices in conservation management into training modules, and carrying out national-level training sessions.
     ■■   Scaling up and replicating successful models of conservation in additional landscape sites: Two new sites will be added this year to further scale up the landscape approach
          model.
     ■■   National coordination for landscape conservation: Supports a project management unit at the MoEF for coordinating among all six implementing agencies.

     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
     The project is expected to lead to an increased natural resource base, reduced dependence on protected areas, and improvement in community livelihoods through the sustainable
     use of biodiversity resources, as well as converging with other programs. It will support the preparation and implementation of village microplans and track benefits accrued to
     beneficiaries, including women.

     Achievements to date:
     ■■   Over 350 microplans have been prepared covering over 15,000 households through substantial social mobilization.
     ■■   Over 400,000 Ha of Protected Area has been brought under improved management.
     ■■   About 15,000 officers from various parts of the country have been given training in different aspects of conservation and landscape planning.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    National Waterway 1, a 1,620 Km stretch of River Ganga, is the longest of the 111 newly declared National waterways in India. If offers the greatest potential contribution to
    economic development of any of India’s waterways; it passes through four resource rich but low income states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal) and can
    potentially contribute to sharper poverty reduction in the region. NW 1 also connects to the western end of the waterway that constitutes the India-Bangladesh protocol route to
    Bangladesh, and via that route, links further to the states of North Eastern India, a region that continues to lag in development.
    NW-1 together with the proposed Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor and National Highway 2 constitute the Eastern Transport Corridor of India connecting the National Capital
    Region of India with the Eastern Seaport of Kolkata. It is estimated that the amount of annual freight flow through the corridor is 370 million tons; however, IWAI carries only 5
    million tons of that freight. The main supply constraint is weak navigation infrastructure which results in its low usage.
    The proposed project covering a 1,360 Km (Haldia to Varanasi) stretch of NW 1 seeks to provide the infrastructure and services that are needed to secure the viability of the
    waterway in an environmentally sustainable manner, including low-draft and fuel-efficient vessel design, modern terminals and good intermodal connectivity. The project also
    envisages adoption of modern dredging technologies and gradually switching over to a performance based ‘assured depth’ contracting framework. This will not only provide
    efficiency but also provide confidence to investors in the navigation capability.
    The Ganga is a critical environmental and cultural resource for India and sustainability needs to be a crucial aspect of the project. The option of constructing heavy infrastructure
    interventions (such as barrages and weirs) on the river was ruled out an early stage and careful siting of land based infrastructure has ensured that no major pilgrimage or urban
    centers will be affected by project facilities. It is expected that the maintenance of flows in the river for navigation could also help with the revival of some wetlands along the Ganga
    that have lost their connection to the river. Similarly, embankments built to prevent erosion of riverbanks by the wave action of passing vessels can also protect local communities
    living by the river from risk of floods, especially in the lower reaches of the river.
    The project’s development objective is to enhance transport efficiency and reliability of National Waterway 1 and augment institutional capacity for the development and
    management of India’s inland waterway transport system in an environmentally sustainable manner. The project has two components:
    Improving the Navigability of National Waterway 1 (Haldia to Varanasi): This component would support improvement of river fairway and maintaining assured navigation depth
    round-the-year through non-intrusive dredging and environmentally friendly river conservancy works; construction of six multi-modal intermodal terminals with future provision
    to allow expansion as market clusters; rehabilitation and new construction of a navigation lock to allow passage of larger vessels; two vessel repairing and maintenance facilities;
    five pairs of ro-ro crossings; 40 km of embankment protection works and navigational aid, river information and disaster management system.
    Strengthening Institutional Capacities and Improving the Investment Climate, Vessel Design and Construction Framework: This component includes institutional strengthening
    of sector institutions and modernization of the sector through training, exposure visits, international benchmarking and introduction of new technologies; undertaking market
    development studies and developing asset management framework through private sector participation: vessel design and standardization with a focus on low draft and efficient
    and clean fuel vessels.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    As an integral part of the high-density eastern transport corridor of India, this project is expected to benefit the four hinterland states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkahnd and West
    Bengal accounting for about 30% of India’s population. The project is also expected to create 25,000 direct and 125,000 indirect jobs. Key expected results include:
    ■■    Supporting navigation of higher vessel sizes up to 2000 MT through provision of higher navigable depth and introduction of low-draft vessels
    ■■    Reduction in cost of cargo traffic transportation by 20% through provision of improved navigation and logistic system
    ■■    Improved reliability of navigation by increasing the yearly navigable period from a current 270 days to 330 days
    ■■    Net Annual GHG emission avoided to the tune of 1086000 tonnes / year
    ■■    Enhanced IWT sector capacity through improved institutional structure and operational framework

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The critical issue now for India’s urban sector is to implement a complex process of policy reform, institutional capacity and investments. The Bank is already providing support to
     urban development through lending, advisory work and knowledge-building activities, and has on-the-ground experience of the main capacity constraints. Bank support for the
     project links this wide-ranging experience directly with the Government of India’s flagship programs of AMRUT and Smart Cities for urban development. In doing so it develops a
     needed framework for action on capacity development that will support the planning, delivery and monitoring of these efforts in India’s ULBs.
     The Project Development Objective (PDO) of CBUD is to assist the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MHUA) to improve planning for urban management in select urban local
     bodies and in the roll-out of national urban missions. Areas and scope of technical assistance are provided to urban local bodies in the areas of finance, governance, planning
     and service delivery. The activities are chosen in a demand-driven manner by ULBs and implemented with support from MHUA. The Project also supports the Ministry’s efforts to
     implement these activities. The project activities are implemented under two main components:

     a.	 Capacity Building for Strengthened Urban Management. This component will support TA across several urban management topics. ULBs will select the desired package of
         assistance, based on an assessment of needs which has been undertaken by the Project Management Unit. This demand driven, menu approach is in response to the variable
         capacity building needs faced by ULBs and/or to support the roll of the national urban missions.
     b.	 Implementation Support.T his component will support a national PMU for providing overall technical and managerial support during implementation. The PMU has a critical
         role in promoting and supporting the project in the areas of quality assurance, procurement advisory services and project administration.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Strategic Plans prepared for 37 ULBs under the Smart Cities Mission
     ■■   Credit rating exercise undertaken and completed for over 100 cities
     ■■   Trained over 2,500 municipal and elected officials on urban governance and management
     ■■   Completed preparation/update of 30 City Development Plans

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    India generates 7.6 million tons of hazardous waste per year, with a large percentage of it illegally dumped outside industrial estates, on abandoned public lands, and
    within privately owned lands. Despite amendment of national legislation, compliance is low and the data is deficient on illegal dumps and hazardous-waste generation and
    characterization. Demand for land due to rapidly increasing urbanization is resulting in use and redevelopment of former industrial land or dump sites, which are at the margins of
    fast expanding cities. Since most of these “brownfield lands” are potentially contaminated with industrial waste, resulting in chemical pollution of soil, surface, and ground waste,
    such contaminated waste sites have the potential to pose significant health risk to communities and exposed individuals, especially poor and marginalized communities located
    on the fringes of urban areas. India needed the support to develop the tools and methodologies for human health risk assessments and the capacity to evaluate the technical,
    economic, legal, social, and environmental feasibility of remediation of contaminated sites.

    The project development objective is to ‘strengthen the capacity of selected state pollution control agencies in the remediation of polluted sites and support development of a
    framework to establish national program for the remediation of polluted sites. The project is targeting sites in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal. Project components
    cover:
    ■■   Strengthening of environmental institutions: Building capacity for addressing pollution remediation.
    ■■   Investments in priority remediation and environmental improvements: Rehabilitation of orphan hazardous waste sites and municipal dumpsites. Three pilot projects (one
         each in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal) will demonstrate sound remediation technologies for Orphan Hazardous Waste and Municipal Solid Waste Disposal
         sites.
    ■■   Project management

    KEY EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   Framework for the establishment of a National Program for the Remediation of Polluted Sites (NPRPS) comprising inventory of polluted sites, remediation methodologies
         and policy and regulatory review has been approved by the Technical Review Committee of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
    ■■   Remediation plans for 9 polluted sites have been developed and are being implemented at two pilot project sites.
    ■■   Capacity of implementing agencies in the laboratory analysis of hazardous chemicals is increased from 26 to 70 parameters
    ■■   National Waste Management Information System (NWMIS), that helps issuance of authorizations under Hazardous Waste Management and Electronic Waste Management
         Rules has been developed and operationalized
    The project is also carrying out activities to establish (i) soil standards for India; and (ii) a network of academic institutions to provide technical advice, training and carry out research
    on remediation on remediation technologies.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India’s current installed power generation capacity stands at more than 305 GW. Sixty-one percent (186 GW) of this capacity is coal-fired, and contributes to over 70 percent of the
     total electricity generation. In the 12th Five-Year Plan of the Government of India, over 80 percent of the generation addition is planned to come under coal-based power plants.
     According to the Planning Commission’s Integrated Energy Policy, coal will remain India’s primary energy source, accounting for nearly 42 percent of total energy consumption and
     65 percent of electricity generation in the next 25 years. Many coal-fired power plants, however, do not operate efficiently, and India’s renovation and modernization investments
     have not kept pace with targets; plants that account for almost 27 GW of capacity urgently need to be renovated and modernized. Focusing on existing plants rather than building
     new ones is a good opportunity to add low-cost power to India’s starving grid, while improving operational efficiencies relatively quickly. The approach also means dealing with
     fewer challenges such as availability of land, existence of transmission lines, and availability of fuel and water linkages.
     The Bank-supported Coal Fired Generation Rehabilitation Project is helping the Government of India design and implement an appropriately sequenced program of pilot projects
     to scale up the Energy-Efficient Renovation and Modernization (EE R&M) of its old, inefficient, and polluting coal-fired power generation capacity. This would help put the sector
     on a lower carbon path than continuing to operate these plants at their present low efficiency levels, while also bridging the power demand-supply gap. Recognizing the large
     carbon emission reduction potential of this project, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has provided a $45.4 million grant.

     The project’s development objective is to improve the energy efficiency of selected coal-fired power generation units through renovation and modernization and improved
     operations and maintenance. The project’s two components focus on:
     ■■   Energy efficiency renovation and modernization pilots to renovate and modernize 420 MW of old coal-fired power generation capacity to demonstrate energy-efficient
          rehabilitation approaches.
     ■■   Technical assistance to support the implementation of pilots, develop a pipeline of pilot interventions, address barriers to energy efficient renovation and modernization
          projects, and strengthen institutional capacities of implementing agencies.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     This project is targeting 420 MW for EE R&M pilots, the success of which could result in the Government of India and various states rehabilitating capacity of identified similar
     plants. The EE R&M work at one of the two pilot Units (Bandel Thermal Power Station, Unit-5 of 210 MW) has been completed and it was synchronized with the electricity grid in
     October 2015. The overall project is expected to have an impact on:
     ■■   Barrier reduction strategy for wider replication of rehabilitation projects: This attempts to address barriers to rehabilitation in the selected pilot states through studies backed
          with international experiences, policy/regulatory dialogue, and strengthening of institutional capacity. In addition, the project has also helped mobilize qualified contractors
          to bid on India’s EE R&M opportunities and will demonstrate effective R&M approaches which can be replicated across the country (and possibly elsewhere) once completed
          successfully.
     ■■   Quick and low-cost option for augmentation of power supply: Given the significant gap between demand and supply of power in India, these pilots will demonstrate whether
          and how the rehabilitation of old coal-fired power plants can augment availability of power on competitive terms.
     ■■   Strengthening institutional capacity of utilities: The engagement with selected state utilities is helping them build institutional capacity, especially in the areas of design and
          execution of R&M projects, and efficient operation and management (O&M) of plants.
     ■■   Improving environmental performance of the plants: In addition to reducing carbon emissions from power plants, the project would support improving the overall environ-
          mental performance of these plants, including particulates emission, water treatment, ash disposal, and overall safeguards practices and policies in the plant – areas that
          sometimes do not attract adequate the attention of the utility. .

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Madhya Pradesh (MP) is a low income state in India with more than one-third of its population living below the poverty line and a strong presence of scheduled castes and tribes.
    Access to public services in MP remains highly unequal. On average, 49 percent of MP citizens do not have access to basic services compared to a national average of 46 percent.
    Moreover, MP has the widest disparities in access to basic services across districts. Critical barriers exist for ensuring universal access to government services such as limited access
    to information, cumbersome procedures and weak accountability systems. Challenges in accessing information about government services, increase transaction costs, especially
    for those in remote areas and for those from under-represented groups.

    The Madhya Pradesh Citizen Access to Responsive Service Project supports the state’s efforts to improve service delivery based on the commitments adopted under its Public
    Service Guarantee Act (PSGA) of 2010. The PSGA is the first of its kind in India. It sets timelines for the delivery of selected public services, creates an appeal structure in the event
    that government officials fail to meet these deadlines, and allows for imposition of penalties for delay. Services are provided by Lok Sewa Kendras (LSKs) or “kiosks” that allow
    citizens to apply for multiple government services at a “one stop shop”. The PSGA has contributed to reducing citizens’ transaction costs, speeding up service delivery and improving
    accountability of public officials. However, not all citizens are benefitting equally from these improvements and traditional barriers to access remain.

    The development objective of the project is to improve access to PSGA services by citizens of Madhya Pradesh, and in particular by under-represented groups.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   Improved access to public services by citizens and by under-represented groups including women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
    ■■   Expansion of the LSK network to remote and underserved areas, increased coverage of services, improved facilitation services at the kiosks and more extensive citizen out-
         reach and awareness campaigns.
    ■■   Better integration of Government services.

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
    Department of Public Service Management through the State Agency for Public Services, which will serve as the Project Directorate.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India has over 5000 large dams that are essential for water storage to cater to India’s increasingly competitive use of scarce water resources. There is limited scope for building
     new dams, however, since all easy dam sites are already in use, acquiring land is difficult, and construction costs are very high. Many existing dams are under distress, and the Dam
     Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) is designed to implement innovative solutions to again allow for the optimal use of the existing 242 dams covered by the project.
     The project’s development objective is to improve the safety and operational performance of selected existing dams in the states of Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu
     and Karnataka and dams owned by Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and Uttarakhand Jal Viduyut Nigam Limited (UJVNL). The project has two major components:
     ■■    Rehabilitation and improvement of dams and associated appurtenances: Comprehensive rehabilitation and improvement of 242 dam and appurtenant structures in the
           project states. In addition, hydrological assessments, preparation of asset management plans and emergency preparedness plans, development of emergency warning
           systems, public awareness campaigns, and floodplain mapping will be carried out.
     ■■    Dam safety institutional strengthening: To support and strengthen the Dam Safety Organization (DSO) at the national level in the Central Water Commission and DSOs and
           Water Resources Departments in each of the four participating states, as well as the State Electricity Boards in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. DSOs will become effective organizations
           that can take the lead in ensuring that dams remain safe from a structural and operational point of view. Dam managers will be assisted with the development of appropriate
           skills and modern tools to adequately operate and maintain dams.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The main results expected at the end of the project includes:
     ■■    242 dams with ability to safety cater for design floods, and with acceptable stability and seepage; 242 dams with basic dam safety facilities in place including O&M plans
     ■■    At least 80% of the required annual budget for O&M allocated
     ■■    60 dams where emergency response plans have been prepared and disseminated to the population.
     Achievement to date includes:
     ■■    556 contracts totaling $223 million have been awarded;
     ■■    Guidelines for Developing Emergency Action Plans for Dams have been prepared; Dam break analysis for all 242 initiated;
     ■■    Guidelines for a) dam instrumentation and monitoring; and b) dam safety operations after seismic event are being prepared and in final stage of finalization by the Govern-
           ment of India

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Eastern Corridor is 1,839 km and extends from Ludhiana in Punjab to Kolkata in West Bengal. World Bank support for the EDFC was conceived as a series of projects in which
    the three sections (total length 1,193 km) would be delivered sequentially, but with considerable overlap in their construction schedules. The first loan (as first phase of an
    Adaptable Program Loan called EDFC 1) was approved by the Board in May 2011 and is now under implementation. EDFC2 was approved by the Board on April 22, 2014, and is
    also under implementation. EDFC 3 supports the Government of India’s effort to construct 401 km of the EDFC from Ludhiana - Khurja in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.

    The EDFC projects includes the most heavily congested sections of the corridor, and connects ports and mining areas in the East to consumption centers in the Northwest of the
    country. It is a top development priority of the government, as rail traffic levels in the main transport corridors are already at or exceed their nominal capacity.

    The project’s development objectives are to provide additional rail transport capacity, improved service quality and higher freight throughput on the 401 km Ludhiana-Khurja
    section of the EDFC; and develop the institutional capacity of DFCCIL to build, maintain and manage the DFC infrastructure network. It has two components:
    ■■   Design, construction and commissioning of the Ludhiana-Khurja section of the Eastern DFC, consisting of 401 km of single-track electrified railway with 1500-meter crossing
         loops at approximate 10-km intervals, designed for freight-only train operations with 25-ton axle-load (upgradable to 32.5 ton axle loads) at maximum speed of 100 km/
         hour. The DFC lines are being built to carry bulk freight trains of 6,000 or 12,000 gross tons.
    ■■   Continuing development of DFCCIL’s/IR’s institutional capacity to build, maintain, and manage DFC lines, including both technical assistance and ancillary works and equip-
         ment focusing on supporting three priority areas: operational management, commercial management (including private participation), and environmental management.
         •	 Operational: Design of system to optimize interfaces at the interchange of trains between IR and EDFC lines at connection points, including train holding yard require-
              ments.
         •	 Commercial: A freight logistics centers market-testing program to promote private investment in freight logistics centers/terminals (along either or both of) Eastern and
              Western Corridors, plus development of a contractual model and seed capital for implementation of a pilot project.
         •	 Environmental: Design and implementation of a pilot project to attain energy savings in IR train operations through a driver advisory system with potential for scaling
              up across DFC with associated reduction in GHG emissions.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    Progress toward achieving the project’s development objective will be measured by four indicators:
    ■■   Number of additional train paths produced on the EDFC3 as 23.
    ■■   Volume of freight carried on EDFC3 as 22 billion net ton kilometer.
    ■■   Average speed of freight trains increased from 25 to 45 kilometer per hour.
    ■■   DFCCIL Memorandum of Understanding rating (with MoR) remain good or higher

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Indian Railways (IR) operates a national rail network of about 64,600 route-kilometers. In 2013-14, it carried 8.4 billion passengers and more than 1 billion tonnes of freight.
     Despite strong growth in its freight business, IR has been losing market share to road haulage, due partly to insufficient physical capacity and poor service quality exacerbated by
     the need to fit freight train movements into a busy passenger service schedule. Without additional rail network capacity, much of the traffic for which rail should have competitive
     advantage would be forced to use road haulage or be suppressed, in both cases at a cost to the economy and in the former case at an environmental cost as well. Over the last
     decade, IR has successfully adopted many management measures to squeeze more capacity from its existing assets; average trainload, equipment utilization, and railway labor
     productivity have all been greatly improved. Physical capacity on key corridors is now the most pressing constraint.

     The Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) project is a strategic response to network constraints on critical freight routes in India that form a quadrilateral, connecting Delhi, Mumbai,
     Chennai, and Kolkata. The rail network between these cities accounts for just 16 percent of IR’s route network by length, but carries more than 60 percent of its freight traffic. With
     India’s freight traffic projected to grow at more than 7 percent annually, the DFC program will add dedicated freight-only lines, mostly parallel to the existing routes, built at higher
     loading standards to permit the operation of larger and heavier axle-load trains. This will not only double the overall rail capacity in the corridors, but also significantly reduce train
     operating costs per unit of freight. The current DFC program includes the Western Corridor (Delhi-Mumbai) and the Eastern Corridor (Ludhiana-Delhi-Kolkata). The Ministry of
     Railways (MoR) is the designated responsible ministry and the shareholder of the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL).
     The World Bank is supporting implementation of a substantial portion of the Eastern DFC under a three phased program. The EDFC-1 is for a 343 km section from Khurja to Kanpur,

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Eastern Corridor is 1,839 km and extends from Ludhiana in Punjab to Kolkata in West Bengal. World Bank support for the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) was
    conceived as a series of projects in which the three sections (total length 1,193 km) would be delivered sequentially, but with considerable overlap in their construction schedules.
    The first loan (as first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan called EDFC 1) was approved by the Board in May 2011 and is now under implementation. EDFC 2 supports the
    Government of India’s effort to construct 393 km of the EDFC from Kanpur to Mughal Sarai in Uttar Pradesh. The project includes the most heavily congested sections of the
    corridor, and connects ports and mining areas in the East to consumption centers in the Northwest of the country. It is a top development priority of the government, as rail traffic
    levels in the main transport corridors are already at or exceed their nominal capacity.
    The project’s development objectives are to provide additional rail transport capacity, improved service quality and higher freight throughout on the 393-km Kanpur-Mughal
    Sarai section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor; and develop institutional capacity of the DFCCIL to build, maintain, and operate the entire rail freight network. It has two
    components:
    ■■   Design, construction and commissioning of the Kanpur-Mughal Sarai section of the EDFC consisting of 393 km of double-track electrified railway designed for freight-only
         train operations with 25-ton axle-loads (upgradable to 32.5 ton axle loads) at 100 km/hour.
    ■■   Continue providing institutional support to assist DFCCIL to develop its capability to best utilize heavy-haul freight rail systems.
    Restructuring: Due to exchange rate fluctuation and competitive bidding, savings of $ 190 million were expected in the project. This amount was cancelled in a restructuring dated
    June 30, 2017.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    Progress toward the achievement of the project’s development objective will be measured by three indicators:
    ■■   Number of additional train paths produced on the EDFC.
    ■■   Volume of freight carried.
    ■■   Improved institutional capacity of DFCCIL.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Given the high dependence of over 100 million forest-dependent poor people, forests in India are facing degradation. The Government of India, through its Ministry of Environment,
     Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) came up with the Green India Mission (GIM) having an ambitious target of improving forest quality on five million hectares of existing
     degraded forests in India. More recently, increased carbon sequestration through forests constitutes a core strategy of India’s NDC targets. Given the scale of the challenge, ESIP is
     designed to provide technical assistance and demonstrative investments for improving the outcomes of the GIM. Along with significantly contributing towards India’s NDC targets,
     ESIP will also build capacity of State Forest Departments for developing and applying biodiversity monitoring protocols that will help bringing new areas and biological corridors
     outside protected areas under better biodiversity management. The project will follow the new generation landscape approach for the forestry sector to improve degraded and
     open forests. This approach allows a combined focus on improving forest and farm productivity, watershed treatments, control of soil erosion and integration of livelihood concerns
     in rural communities. Direct beneficiaries of ESIP will be forest dwellers, small and marginal landholders, landless individuals, small livestock holders, and NTFP collectors, as well
     as their community organizations such as Joint Forest Management Committees, Self Help Groups, and other resource groups in the forest landscapes and micro-watersheds.

     The project development objective (PDO) is to Improve forest quality, land management and non-timber forest produce (NTFP) benefits for forest dependent communities in
     selected landscapes in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The project has the following four components:

     1.	           Strengthen Capacity of Government Institutions in Forestry and Land Management Programs in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
     2.	           Investments for Improving Forest Quality in Selected Landscapes
     3.	           Scaling-up Sustainable Land and Ecosystem Management in Selected Landscapes
     4.	           Project Management

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The project is expected to contribute to increased carbon sequestration of up to 10% over the baseline in the dry-deciduous degraded forests, help improve carbon sequestration
     measurements and monitoring, lead to better incomes for forest-dependent communities through NTFP value chains and promote and scale up best practices on Sustainable Land
     and Ecosystem Management (SLEM) across the project landscapes. It will also support monitoring of land degradation and desertification indicators developed under a previous
     GEF-World Bank funded project. The project is expected to yield the following results:
     ■■    About 25,000 Ha land area to benefit from application of SLEM best practices
     ■■    Increase in average cumulative carbon sequestered per hectare in areas supported by the project
     ■■    About 25,000 people, including women to directly benefit from investments made under the project
     ■■    About 5,000 land users adopting SLEM practices as a result of project investments

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    There are about 300 million people in India today that still lack access to electricity, impeding their ability to fully benefit from a growing economy. Rural consumers and the urban
    poor constitute the majority of this unconnected population. Even those who do have a connection to the electricity grid face intermittent power supply, particularly in rural areas.
    Industry and commercial enterprises also suffer due to unreliable supply, and are forced to invest in expensive diesel-fueled back-up generation. India’s power sector relies heavily
    on fossil fuels (primarily coal), and the country is currently the world’s fourth largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter. To address these issues, the Government of India plans to: (i)
    install 175GW of renewable energy by 2022; (ii) strengthen the central transmission network to facilitate smoother energy exchange across regions; (iii) improve energy efficiency
    and performance of institutions in the power sector; and (iv) expand access for rural and peri-urban populations.

    The Fifth Power System Project builds on a successful partnership with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), the national electricity transmission company that
    is vital to the development of India’s power sector. Not only has the WBG financed POWERGRID’s investment programs (through five direct loans), but it has also supported its
    ongoing efforts to achieve world class operations and management, and to leverage private participation (including with IFC financing of the Bhutan-India Tala transmission
    system). WBG’s support to this project came in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, when both international and domestic credit markets became severely constrained. In
    India, the cost of debt for domestic investors increased by at least 20 to 30 percent, and the availability of both debt and risk capital for infrastructure projects decreased. Additional
    financing to POWERGRID was also part of broader efforts to scale-up IBRD financing in response to the financial crisis.
    The project’s development objective is to strengthen India’s electricity transmission system in the Western, Northern, and Southern regions to increase reliable power exchange
    between regions and states. Investments under the project will help improve POWERGRID’s service delivery by facilitating more economic use of generation resources; providing
    greater grid stability; and facilitating development of a power trading regime within the country and with India’s neighbors.

    KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■   Annual inter-regional power exchange has gone up from a baseline of 46,027 MU to 94,366 million units (MU), surpassing the target of 72,000 MU.
    ■■   Transmission capacity of the Central Transmission Utility of India has increased from a baseline of 71,447 circuit km to more than 129,000-circuit km, outperforming original
         end-of-project targets (125,000 circuit km).
    ■■   Transformation capacity increased significantly from a baseline of 79,500 megavolt amperes (MVA) to more than 254,000 MVA, outperforming end-of-project targets
         (222,000 MVA).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Indian Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector is facing high and rising energy costs, unlike other sectors of the economy such as agriculture that benefit from
     subsidized energy prices. Many Indian MSMEs are energy-intensive, employing inefficient and outmoded technologies. Investments in cost-effective energy-efficiency measures
     would improve their productivity and bottom-line profits. The barriers to adopting energy efficiency measures typically include access to finance, a gap in understanding between
     energy auditors and energy-efficiency practitioners and local banks, higher transaction costs for preparing energy-efficiency proposals, and imperfect information. MSMEs are also
     generally unfamiliar with the performance of readily available efficient equipment. The project development objective is to increase demand for energy efficiency investments in
     target MSME clusters, and to build their capacity to access commercial finance. The project has four components, focusing on five MSME industrial clusters:
     1.	 Increasing awareness of energy efficiency through outreach efforts, and dissemination of information about successful projects. Increase capacity of energy auditors, financial
         intermediaries, vendors, and MSMEs.
     2.	 Preparation and implementation of 500 energy-efficiency proposals through technical assistance for preparing Investment Grade Detailed Project Reports. That involves
         detailed energy audits and preparing financing plans, facilitating loans from banks and financial intermediaries, and providing implementation support.
     3.	 Broad programmatic knowledge management for monitoring and evaluation, collection of best practice examples, dissemination, and policy development functions, with
         the goal of ensuring effective implementation and replication of energy efficiency improvement efforts at MSMEs.
     4.	 Implementation support for the two project management units
     The Project Development Objectives of the parent project have been fully achieved and implementation of additional financing has started during November, 2017 extending the
     project components to 10 clusters. The EE efforts in the new clusters are expanded to demonstrate and mobilize investments for Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production (RECP)

     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
     ■■   1.5 million Lifetime emission reductions by direct investments of INR 970 Million in EE improvements, and estimated replicable investments of INR 2,520 Million with
          potential ERs of 3.6 million.
     ■■   Direct Emission reductions are about 0.9 million are achieved through EE investments of about INR 1000 million. All the estimated potential and replicable ERs and EE
          investments are expected to be achieved by the end of the project period
     ■■   600 Investment Grade Energy-Efficiency Proposals completed out of a target of 500. Of these, implementation of EE measures are completed by 450 units and implemen-
          tation is ongoing in rest of the units. ..

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    With about 330,000 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity (as of August, 2017), the Indian power system is among the largest in the world, but per capita consumption of
    electricity is less than one-fourth of the world average. An estimated 300 million people are not connected to the national electrical grid. Even when connected, many face frequent
    disruptions. Solar photovoltaics (PV) has emerged as a promising long-term option to meet India’s growing energy demand while addressing the adverse environmental impacts
    of conventional fuels. The Government of India (GOI) has announced a bold target of installing 100 gigawatts (GW) of solar power out of a total renewable energy target of 175
    GW by 2022. Of these, 40 GW will be installed in solar rooftop. A market analysis commissioned by GOI estimates the market potential of GRPV in India at 124,000MW. However,
    there has so far been only a modest uptake of solar roof top systems. As of September 2017, only about 1.2 GW of GRPV projects have been completed. Considering the above
    background and investment needs of the sector, the GOI requested the World Bank’s support through this project in helping it achieve its targets of solar-power capacity in India
    by 2022.

    The borrower is State Bank of India acting as a nodal project implementing agency while passing the funds onwards to the customer for installation of solar roof top projects. The
    development objective of the Program for Results Grid-connected Rooftop Solar Program for India is to increase installed capacity of Grid-connected Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic
    (GRPV) and to strengthen the capacity of relevant institutions for GRPV. The project will focus on mobilizing private sector equity investments and commercial lending, increasing
    deployment and uptake of GRPV through a variety of business models, and thereby contributing to the achievement of GoI’s GRPV installation targets. The duration of the Program
    will be five and a half years, with a start date of May 2016 and end date of November 2021.

    KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
    ■■    The project aims to support generation of 250 MW of renewable energy enabling reduction of carbon emissions of 1200 tons by Nov 2021.
    ■■    The SBI has already financed solar rooftop projects worth $65 million, with private developers. This would add at least 100 MW of solar rooftop capacity to the grid.
    ■■    The project has also started the work on the overall capacity development of the sector. This will (i) support an innovative risk mitigation mechanism to enable lending to
          small and medium enterprises (SME), commercial and industrial customers for GRPV, and (ii) to support strengthening of the investment climate and capacity building of the
          main stakeholders involved in the expansion of GRPV.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Gujarat has one of the most extensive and traffic-intensive road networks in the country. The state’s has about 145,000 km of roads, including 3,170 km of national highways,
     18,450 km of state highways, and 20,560 km of major district roads. The Roads and Buildings Department (R&BD) has the primary responsibility for managing about 80,000
     km of primary road network and 30,000 km of non-plan roads, with higher-level strategic guidance/oversight from the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board. Despite rapid
     expansion in the network capacity and quality, owing mainly to the government’s sustained emphasis on road development, the road sector faces a new set of challenges to keep
     up with rapidly increasing demand, improve connectivity to the relatively underdeveloped eastern tribal region of the state, and associated financing and safety considerations.

     The main goal of the Gujarat State Highways Project II (GSHP II) is to extend Bank assistance to address these challenges. Because this is a follow-up project in an advanced state, it
     will place relatively less emphasis on financing civil works—reflected in smaller loan-size with a higher ratio of counterpart and private funding—and increase focus on finance-plus
     aspects. For example: (i) new contracting approach to improve investment and operational efficiency by transferring design risks to the contractors, and clubbing maintenance
     responsibilities for a longer period; (ii) pilot transactions to leverage innovative private sector investment (modified annuity); and (iii) various steps to increase the sector’s
     institutional and financial capacity to improve road service and safety in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective manner.

     The project development objective is to improve capacity and enhance the quality and safety of road services for the users of the Core Road Network (CRN) of state highways in
     Gujarat, through institutional strengthening and efficient contracting and financing strategies. The project is structured around three components:
     1.	 Highway improvement includes upgrading about 350 km and rehabilitating 275 km of state highways through a mix of nine performance-based maintenance contracts, one
         PPP annuity-based Design, Building, Finance, Operate, Maintain and Transfer (DBFOMT) contract and one output and performance-based road contract (OPRC).
     2.	 Sector policy and institutional development seeks to deepen the GSHP I efforts towards improving R&BD’s operational capacity, and also augment the state’s capacity in two
         more critical areas: policy and planning; and knowledge-building.
     3.	 Road safety management strengthens the road safety management system and improves capacity to undertake multi-sectoral road safety interventions in the state through a
         safe corridor demonstration project on two high-volume, high-safety risk corridors, enhancing asset management with safety attributes, and strengthening the Gujarat Road
         Safety Management System.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The project will directly improve the condition, capacity and safety of about 625 km of the 6,444-km core state road network. It is expected that this will directly benefit about
     38 million local businesses and inhabitants served by the project roads, as well as road users, of whom about half are women. The improved roads will have significantly better
     capacity and robustness. Travel time should fall by about 30 percent, while the average volume/capacity ratio, a key measure of highway congestion, should decline significantly.
     The emphasis on road safety ought to help reduce fatalities by 20 percent on the safe demonstration corridor.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     R&BD, Government of Gujarat.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Context
     While India is recognized as a leading global manufacturer of high-quality generic drugs, industry gaps and market failures constrain its innovation capabilities, limiting its
     competitiveness and ability to address its disease burden. To successfully transition toward world-class innovation in biologics and medical devices, India needs to overcome
     the market failures that currently undermine private incentives to invest in R&D and negatively affect the performance of innovative entrepreneurs. These include sub-optimal
     investment in public goods critical to translational research, institutional failures in management of innovation systems and lack of private investment in pilot-to-market stages of
     product development due to risk perception. India has recognized the need for strong innovation policies particularly in support of the biopharmaceutical sector. India’s strategy,
     “Decade of Innovations 2010-20”, aims at strengthening innovation capacities including by increasing gross expenditure on R&D to two percent of GDP by 2020. The World Bank
     can leverage its experience in financing and supporting the implementation of innovation, competitiveness, and public health projects to help the Government of India unlock
     India’s potential for increased innovation.
     Project objectives and description

     The project development objective (PDO) is to facilitate innovation in biopharmaceutical products and medical devices that address public health priorities in India.
     Interventions will be targeted at alleviating critical gaps in infrastructure, human capital, and technology transfer that have been identified as weak areas in the pilot-to-market
     innovation ecosystem for biologicals and medical technology products and enabling product development. This will include grant funding to support the creation of centers of
     excellence for validation, early stage bio-manufacturing, clinical development, training, and technology transfer. Most of the funding for the Project will be allocated in the form of
     grants following open, competitive and transparent calls for proposals, thereby leveraging market demand.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■    At least 6 biopharmaceutical, diagnostics or medical devices addressing public health priorities advanced at least one step on the product development pathway
     ■■    At least 15 new Intellectual Property registrations or product prototypes
     ■■    At least 2 technologies licensed for manufacturing or commercialization
     ■■    At least 6 Technology Transfer Offices established
     ■■    At least 60 companies using shared facilities supported by the project

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    India has 63 million people living in low-elevation coastal areas, endowed with significant ecological and economic resources. These coastal areas are unable to ensure balanced
    development due to the increasing threat of hazards on economic and livelihood security; fragmented and weak institutional frameworks; and lack of appropriate knowledge-based
    decision-making. As a result, coastal and marine resources are depleted and degraded. Unless these resources are conserved as part of overall economic development plans, there
    will be further impacts on the livelihood, health, and well-being of the coastal population. In 2006, the Government of India adopted the Integrated Coastal Zone Management
    (ICZM) approach (a shift from a purely regulatory to a management approach) that would, with people’s participation, promote livelihood security of the coastal communities,
    protect the ecosystems, and promote sustainable development. In 2007, the government of India requested the Bank’s financing to create the initial institutional and knowledge
    bases to support its long-term reform agenda, and to pilot activities that would inform larger future projects and programs. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project is
    the largest ever Bank financing in coastal zone projects, and one of the largest ever for knowledge outputs.

    Project components cover:
    National ICZM capacity building aims to establish and support an appropriate national institutional structure for guiding and coordinating coastal zone management. It includes:
    (i) hazard line and coastal sediment cell mapping; (ii) mapping and management of ecologically sensitive areas; (iii) establishing a new national institute for sustainable coastal
    zone management; and (iv) national-level capacity building.

    KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
    The ICZMP had a significant impact on India’s outlook on coastal space, with GOI’s recognition of ICZM approaches as one of the key adaptation strategies in India’s INDCa. ICZMP
    has in the interim achieved valuable results under 3 key categories:
    ■■ Setting up institutions at the national and state level for managing coastal zone complexities, including: National and State Level Coastal Zone Management Authorities
         (NCZMA, and SCZMAs).	
    ■■ Knowledge and Planning Base for ICZM: The NCSCM is functioning as an autonomous center supporting research and knowledge management for sustainable coastal man-
         agement. The planning and knowledge base established by NCSCM include: (i) databases for coastal, marine biodiversity network; (ii) National GHG emission database for
         coastal ecosystems; (iii) baseline for coastal sediment cell delineation as benchmark with coastal maps; and (iv) futuristic research on marine and coastal areas.
    ■■ Implementation of Demonstrable ICZM Pilot Activities, including: Infrastructure for Coastal Conservation and Protection covering 400 km coastline of Odisha; Completion of
         one of the largest mangrove restoration/plantation in the world covering more than 12,000 hectares involving village communities; 40,000 new non-culturable microbes
         discovered and meta-gene mapping complete (West Bengal); Completion of Pollution Abatement pilots relating to sewerage with treatment plants for about 1 million pop-
         ulation as well as other village-level micro projects providing renewalbe power and livelihoods; Built 14 multipurpose cyclone shelters

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    In September 2014, the northern region of India experienced torrential monsoon rains causing major flooding and landslides. The continuous spell of rains from September 2 - 6,
    2014, caused Jhelum and Chenab Rivers as well as many other streams/tributaries to flow above the danger mark. The Jhelum River also breached its banks flooding many low-
    lying areas in Anantnag, Srinagar and adjoining districts. The flood affected region, consists of 22 districts. A Rapid Disaster Needs Assessment (RDNA) was conducted in Fenruary
    2015. The RDNA estimates the total damages and loss caused by floods at about INR211,975 million (equivalent US$3,550.45), most of comprised of housing, livelihoods, and
    roads and bridges. Public service infrastructure and equipment of hospitals and education centers were also severely damaged and are still not fully operational.

    The Jhelum and Tawi Disaster Recovery Project (JTFRP)t aims to support the recovery and increase disaster resilience in Project Areas and increase the capacity of the Project
    Implementing Entity to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project will focus on restoring critical infrastructure using international best practice
    on resilient infrastructure. Given the region’s vulnerability to both floods and earthquakes, the infrastructure will be designed with upgraded resilient features, and will include
    contingency planning for future disaster events. Therefore, the project aims at both restoring essential services disrupted by the floods and improving the design standard and
    practices to increase resilience.
    The project is comprised of the following seven components: Reconstruction and strengthening of critical infrastructure (US$60 million); Reconstruction of roads and bridges
    (US$80 million); Restoration of urban flood management infrastructure (US$50 million); Restoration and strengthening of livelihoods (US$15 million); Strengthening disaster
    risk management capacity (US$25 million); Contingent Emergency Response (US$0 million; Implementation Support (US$20 million).


    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   15 critical infrastructure reconstructed (buildings) will be strengthened comprised of hospitals, higher and technical education buildings, fire stations, and selected block and
         district offices, and other important public buildings.
    ■■   300 Km of roads and bridges will be reconstructed and 56 pumping stations restored for flood management in Srinagar
    ■■   10,000 artisans will benefit from restored non-farm livelihood and infrastructure
    ■■   Hydrometeorological Resilient Action Plan developed with an early warning system in the region

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Karnataka, located in the southwest of India, is the eighth largest state in the country, with a population of about 61 million. With 34 percent of the people living in urban centers,
     Karnataka is the fifth most urbanized state in India. Although considered to be a middle-income state and growing at or above the all-India economic rate of growth, Karnataka
     has wide regional development disparities, posing risks for sustaining high growth and making it more inclusive. Improving infrastructure, including road transport, is a key
     component of the Government of Karnataka’s development strategy to sustain growth and bridge regional disparities. Within the state’s relatively extensive road network of
     208,262 km, the Department of Public Works, Ports, and Inland Water Transport is responsible for managing 22,078 km of state highways and 50,037 km of major district roads.
     The department faces two notable challenges: a significant paucity of resources for improving the quality and standards of transport infrastructure, and worsening road safety (in
     2009, the state accounted for 10 percent of road accidents and 7 percent of road fatalities in all of India). The Bank-supported Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project aims
     to support the government of Karnataka in two areas of highway development: (i) achieving more diversified sector financing, building upon India’s experience in extensive use
     of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the development of national highways; and (ii) improving road safety design, management, and enforcement to reduce road fatalities
     and major injuries.

     The project development objective is to accelerate the development of the Core Road Network by leveraging public-sector outlays with private-sector financing and improving the
     institutional effectiveness of the road-sector agencies to deliver effective and safe roads to users. The project has four components:
     ■■    Road improvement works support capital improvement and maintenance works of core road network through a combination of traditional contracts and PPP concessions.
     ■■    Highway financing modernization assists the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited in implementing the concept of co-financing with private financial institu-
           tions through technical assistance and pilot transactions.
     ■■    Road safety improvement helps the Government of Karnataka respond to the growing road safety problems in the state with comprehensive strategic and institutional mea-
           sures, consistent with the main thrusts of the 2007 Sundar Committee report and the findings of the road safety management capacity review.
     ■■    Road-sector policy and institutional development support implementation of a new medium-term Institutional Development and Strengthening Action Plan for 2010-2016.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■    The Government of Karnataka is expected to generate at least $400 million in new private-sector capital for Core Road Network improvement and management by 2018; as
           of August 2016, $295 million has been generated.
     ■■    1198 km to be upgraded and widened; As of August 2016, 480 km was upgraded and widened.
     ■■    Share of Core Road Network in good condition increases from 50 to 65 percent by 2018;
     ■■    Vehicle operating costs are targeted to decrease by 15 percent, and travel time cost on project corridors is targeted to decrease by 25 percent by 2018.
     ■■    Road accident-related fatalities on safe corridor pilots should decrease by 30 percent by 2018.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The project builds on the success of the earlier Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project (closed March 2011), implemented in Hubballi-Dharwad, Kalaburagi and
    Belagavi covering approximately 10% of the total population which demonstrated that continuous and reliable piped water supply was technically feasible. The Karnataka Urban
    Water Supply Modernization Project (KUWSMP) aims to help provide city-wide access to a continuous piped water supply and also strengthen service delivery arrangements at the
    city level in Hubballi-Dharwad. The Project will finance physical investments in the water supply system to facilitate continuous water supplies along with the systems, procedures,
    and equipment required to sustainably deliver the improved services.

    KUWSMP strengthens local level ownership of the project in two ways. First, by supporting the establishment of an Urban Local Body (ULB)-owned water utility as a Special Purpose
    Vehicle (SPV) which will be responsible for water services in the city and answerable to the ULB. Second, approximately 26 percent of the capital works to be financed by the ULB
    drawing on its own resources to mobilize funds from the domestic capital markets. The project components are:
    ■■   Capital Investment Program – Includes capital works, service improvement plan and construction management
    ■■   Institutional Building - This will finance costs associated with operationalizing the SPVs and related matters
    ■■   Technical Assistance for Sector Development – To include project impact evaluation, improving social accountability and improving dam management
    Project Management - This component finances activities to ensure efficient and effective project implementation like equipment to establish PMU/PIU offices, consultants to
    support technical evaluations, third party monitoring, expert reviewer, safeguards and fiduciary auditing, construction quality assurance, communications and others.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   1.1 million project beneficiaries of continuous water supply
    ■■   Establishment of an operational Urban Local Body owned special purpose vehicle responsible for water services
    ■■   Building project ownership for the urban local body by making them co-financers of the project.
    ■■   60,000 new piped connections

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Approximately 60 percent of India’s population depends on rain-fed agriculture for their primary livelihood. Thirteen states, including Karnataka, account for about 75 percent of
     the total rain-fed area in India, and have low agricultural productivity and are susceptible to drought, deepening environmental stress, and degradation. The Government of India is
     helping states address these issues through the Watershed Management Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) scheme. Yet government supported
     watershed management schemes, which finance soil and water conservation activities, have not achieved desired results. The Karnataka Watershed Development Project-II (KWDP-
     II) is a new approach for watershed management in India. The design builds on the earlier Bank-supported Karnataka Watershed Development Project-I (KWDP-I), viewed as one of
     the World Bank’s most successful watershed projects, winning five prestigious national and three major international awards. KWDP-I generated a substantial number of positive
     lessons and best practices around community-based integrated watershed management, agricultural intensification, rural livelihoods, and monitoring and evaluation. With
     KWDP-II, the Bank is providing mainly technical support to help the Watershed Management Component of PMKSY achieve better results based on scientific inputs and innovative
     practices. The project development objective is to demonstrate more effective watershed management through greater integration of programs related to rain-fed agriculture,
     innovative and science-based approaches, and strengthened institutions and capacities. The main components and key objectives are:
     ■■      Improved program integration in rain-fed areas using a science-based approach in project areas;
     ■■      Research, development and innovation to provide more comprehensive knowledge and tools for effective integrated watershed management;
     ■■      Institutional strengthening for improved delivery of technical services in support of integrated watershed management;
     ■■      Strengthening horticulture to improve value addition, post-harvest management and links to the state’s E-market system for key horticultural products;
     ■■      Effective and efficient project management.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     Under the project, new science-based approaches and tools will be adopted into wider IWMP watershed operations, such as improved hydrological inputs as part of landscape
     scale watershed assessments, and models used for site selection. Up to 70 percent of micro-watersheds will have improved convergence and integration with other programs such
     as NREGS. Agricultural and horticultural productivity in IWMP project areas for selected crops is expected to increase. Key results to date include:
     ■■      The Land Resource Inventory (LRI) work has been completed in all 698 original micro-watersheds (MWSs) and is being scaled up to 1,930 sites;
     ■■      LRI data is now being used other state government agencies to support integrated planning and convergence in centrally sponsored schemes; such as the Mahatma Gandhi
             National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) and PMKSY;
     ■■      Hydrological monitoring is taking place in 14 micro-watersheds and methodology incorporated into the LRI work;
     ■■      A total of 179 weather/telemetric weather stations have been established in project areas to fill gaps in project areas within the state-wide weather system and weekly weather
             advisories are now sent to farmers via text messages;
     ■■      A comprehensive integrated data base (Digital Library), web-based portal (Geo-Portal), and decision support systems (DSS) tools for specific applications around watershed

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Kerala is considered a front runner in India’s decentralization reforms. Local governments in Kerala are in a unique situation—taking on more devolved responsibilities and with
    a greater degree of local autonomy. Kerala is undertaking a second generation of decentralization reforms, which focus, in a practical and incremental manner, on expanding
    local expenditure autonomy, strengthening local government institutional capacity, and enhancing the state government’s ability to manage and oversee the intergovernmental
    fiscal system. The Kerala Local Government and Service Delivery Project contributes to the Government of Kerala’s second generation decentralization reforms through support
    to enhance governance and improve service delivery. At the national level, the project supports the overall process of decentralization as mandated under the 73rd and 74th
    Constitutional Amendments of the Government of India. The project development objective is to enhance and strengthen the institutional capacity of the local government system
    in Kerala to deliver services and undertake basic administrative and governance functions more effectively and sustainably. The project supports 978 Gram Panchayats (GPs) and
    60 municipalities across the state. The project has four components:
    ■■   Performance grants: Provides GPs and municipalities with additional discretionary funds, based on a formula, to expand local investment in the creation, maintenance, and
         operation of capital assets, to help strengthen institutional capacity.
    ■■   Capacity building: Provides inputs to strengthen and supplement the existing systems and human resources of GPs and municipalities, to enhance their institutional per-
         formance.
    ■■   Performance monitoring: Strengthening the system of performance monitoring GPs and municipalities across the state.
    ■■   Support the project management unit: within the Local Self Government (LSG) Department in overall coordination, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of the
         project.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   87 percent of 1,038 LSGs qualified for enhanced performance grants for boosting service delivery.
    ■■   Five completed annual performance evaluations of all LSGs, demonstrating a strong commitment to improving systems and processes of local public administration.
    ■■   40,000 subprojects financed. Sub-projects include e-governance enhancements (e.g. enabling citizens to get birth, death, and marriage certificates on time), connective
         infrastructure (e.g. roads), social services (e.g. education, health and anganwadi centers), income generation (street lights, bus stands, bus parks, markets), water supply and
         sanitation, solid and liquid waste management, energy projects, and LSGs’ front office modernization and computerization
    ■■   185 subprojects financed in the 60 most backward and revenue constrained local governments mostly in roads and water.
    ■■   Support to Information Kerala Mission to roll out various e-governance systems in all LSGs enabled enhanced service delivery, transparency, and accountability. LSGs have
         migrated from maintenance of manual bookkeeping and accounting to computerized double entry accounting, as well as online planning and budgeting systems.
    ■■   Production of 11 manuals in the areas of budget, planning, financial management, public works/procurement, safeguards, etc.
    ■■   21 million people have benefited from the project, against an end-of-project target of 29.5 million.
    ■■   Provided training to over 1,000 LSGs’ elected representatives and functionaries, and contributed to modernization of the state government’s focal institutes for local govern-
         ment capacity building, namely Kerala Institute of Local Administration and the State Institute for Rural Development.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Kerala has the highest human development outcomes in India, with 99 percent literacy, the highest life expectancy, and the lowest rates of infant mortality. Despite India’s recent
     economic slowdown as a result of the global downturn, Kerala’s economy preformed much better than expected (gross state domestic product (GSDP) $59.4 billion: FY2011-
     2012). Nonetheless, Kerala has not been spared from the global slowdown; low capital investment in economic infrastructure has been an unfortunate consequence of fiscal
     constraints and high revenue expenditures. Kerala’s draft Road Development Policy estimates that improving existing roads to match the economic aspirations of the state will
     require an annual investment of $885 million over the next 10 years.
     The main goal of the Kerala State Transport Project II (KSTP II), which follows the first KSTP that ended in 2010, is to support the state in upgrading the most critical and strategically
     important state highways and building sustainable institutions. On a pilot basis, a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the State’s Public Works Department and a private
     concessionaire—one of the first of its kind in India—will be established to deliver a specific road section. The Bank’s technical assistance is aimed at helping the state attract much
     needed private-sector investment and innovation to the road sector. The project also seeks to support efforts by the government to reverse the trend in road accidents and deaths.
     While the number of road crashes in Kerala declined by 17 percent between 2005 and 2011, the number of traffic fatalities has increased by 27 percent during the same period,
     from 3,200 to 4,100. The project will pilot the concept of road safety demonstration corridors and increase local participation through a “road safety challenge fund”.

     The project’s development objective is to improve conditions, traffic flow, and road safety, with a focus on vulnerable road users, on selected roads in Kerala. The Project has three
     components:
     ■■   Road network upgrading and safety improvement includes upgrading (widening to full two-lane standard) 363 km of strategically important state highways to complete
          network connectivity in the state.
     ■■   Road safety management supports the strengthening of the road safety management systems in Kerala with the objective of arresting the increase of crash fatalities in the
          state, with a particular focus on vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists).
     ■■   Institutional strengthening improves the sustainability of Kerala’s state road network with respect to its functional adequacy, financial viability, and capacity of key state road
          sector institutions to deliver road infrastructure and services that are responsive to road user needs.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■   The project will enhance connectivity between key socio-economic centers and reduce travel times between the main engines of economic activity in the state.
     ■■   It is expected that the project will reach 13.4 million direct beneficiaries, more than half of whom are women.
     ■■   Travel time on the improved roads should decrease by 20 percent. Approximately 350 km of improved roads will have significantly improved capacity and smoothness.
     ■■   The road safety emphasis of the projects should help reduce the number of fatalities by 20 percent on the safe road demonstration corridors

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Housing shortages in India, with a growing urban population, are the result of complex supply and demand factors. Inappropriate land-use policies and building norms artificially
    restrict the supply of housing. There is a lack of land serviced by utilities with appropriate zoning and formal property rights. Demand is constrained by lack of formal housing
    finance, especially for lower-income households (incomes below INR 25,000 per month) - the target segment for the Project. More than 90 percent of the housing shortage is faced
    by these lower-income households, which have traditionally not been a commercial target for mainstream financial institutions but now emerging as a commercially viable asset
    class. Only 31 percent of these households with housing loans obtained their mortgages from the two cheapest sources of credit (banks and government programs). Microfinance,
    if available, is restricted to small loan sizes with high interest rates. Lower-income households face high borrowing costs due to, among other things, the informality of their income
    (no documentation of income) and the informality of their dwelling (no clear title to the property that can be mortgaged).
    The main objective of the Low-Income Housing Finance Project for India is to provide access to sustainable housing finance for low-income households to purchase, build, or
    upgrade their dwellings. The project aims to address market failures by giving the necessary capacity building and implementation support and incentives to the National Housing
    Bank (NHB)—the apex level financial institution for housing finance in India—intermediary institutions, and primary lending institutions to expand lending to lower-income groups
    including to informal sector households against alternate security. The project also provides finance for NHB to refinance low-income housing loans made by primary lenders.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   The Project intends to increase the number of primary lenders active in the low-income segments. Till June 2017, 16 PLIs have participated in the project.
    ■■   The Project has supported increased lending to lower-income borrowers. Approximately USD 88m of loans have been disbursed to targeted beneficiaries, mostly with infor-
         mal sources of income.
    ■■   The Project expects to increase the number of borrowers in low-income segments. Till June 2017, approximately 14000 targeted beneficiaries have received long term
         finance through the Project.
    ■■   The project also expects to: develop prudent lending standards to serve the more vulnerable, lower-income households; expand the coverage of credit bureaus to include
         informal-income borrowers; develop consumer information and disclosure norms for the project’s target groups; enhance the appraisal capacity of the lenders; and pilot new
         policies and products to overcome the challenges of dwelling informality.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Madhya Pradesh (MP), with a State GDP of $728, is a low-income state with poverty rate of 31.7, Nearly 9% of the Indian poor are in Madhya Pradesh, a state with a population of 73
     million, of which 75% live in rural areas. While average human development indicators in MP resemble the national average, rural areas, women, and Scheduled Caste/Scheduled
     Tribe (SC/ST) groups face significant disadvantages. Nearly 10% of all students in higher education in India are enrolled in a higher education institute in MP. These 1.6 million
     students attend 36 universities and 1,316 colleges in the state. In 2012-13, MP’s Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education was 19.5%, close to the national average of
     21.1%. However, in the age group 18 to 23 years, only 13.1% of SC students and 7.5% of ST students were enrolled in higher education. Enrollment rates for women students in
     MP are especially low, with only 36% of enrollments comprising women students, relative to a national average of 45%. In 2012, the Bank carried out a major review of the higher
     education sector in MP, resulting in the report ‘Madhya Pradesh Higher Education Reforms: Policy Options’. In addition to the two core challenges discussed above — access and
     equity — the report identifies low quality as a fundamental concern. Only about half of an incoming cohort of students graduates at the end of three years, with an even smaller
     percent finding employment. The higher education sector in the state is hamstrung by over-centralized and ineffective governance biased towards bureaucratization and lack of
     autonomy for institutions, quality accreditation replaced by an affiliation system, and resource use and management disconnected from performance or outcome.

     Following the launch of the report, the Government of Madhya Pradesh sought assistance from the World Bank for quality improvement and reforms in the higher education
     sector. The development objective of the Madhya Pradesh Higher Education Quality Improvement Project is to improve student outcomes in selected higher education institutions
     and to increase the effectiveness of the higher education system in Madhya Pradesh.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■   First year undergraduate enrollment increased from 0.29 million to 0.35 million in 2017.
     ■■   150 government Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are in the process of preparing their institutional development plans guided by the Indian Institute of Management
          Indore. Grants to fund these plans expected to be released by March 2018.
     ■■   Number of government HEIs accredited by NAAC increased from 37 to 51 in 2017.
     ■■   Key officials in the higher education sector granted greater financial powers for carrying out project related activities.
     ■■   Grant support to HEIs will support improving efficiency in higher education through increase in on-time graduation rates.
     ■■   Grant support to HEIs will support improving equity in higher education: (a) support to disadvantaged students to complete degree programs at HEIs; (b) increase in Transi-
          tion Rate of disadvantages students; (c) Occupancy of Hostels
     ■■   Tracking of graduates to begin using state wide online systems for improving employability of HE students

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    India is going through an unprecedented urban transformation that requires massive investments in urban services and infrastructure. Madhya Pradesh (MP) is geographically
    the second largest, fifth most populous, and eighth most urbanized state in India. At present, its urban population consists of 20.1 million inhabitants with a relatively low level of
    access to basic services, resulting from underinvestment on essential services. In the last years, MP has started to focus on urbanization and has undertaken an ambitious reform
    program aiming at strengthening its Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). In this context, the Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Project (MPUDP) focuses on the mobilization of financial
    resources for urban infrastructure investments by strengthening the financial and administrative capacity of ULBs to plan, finance, and deliver services in a financially sustainable
    manner. To do this, the project seeks to enhance the capacity of the Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Company to improve coverage of key urban services and increase the
    revenue of participating ULBs. It does so through two components, one on institutional development focusing on six areas of policy reforms and on the strengthening of MPUDC,
    and the second on the financing of urban investments, mostly in the water and sanitation sectors.


    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   The contracts of the initial 30% investments, consisting of two water supply systems and one sanitation system have already been awarded.
    ■■   A pipeline of water and sanitation projects is being developed.
    ■■   A Project Management Consultancy to support the strengthening if MPUDC and the implementation of the project has already been awarded.
    ■■   The hiring of a Reform Support Consultancy has been delayed for three months, but once in place, it will support the implementation of the six areas of reform.
    ■■   Training activities will start once the Reform Support Consultancy is in place.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Farmers in the state of Maharashtra have severely limited choices in accessing markets. They continue to rely on regulated wholesale markets—known as mandi, or Agriculture
     Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets—which are mandatory for the wholesale trading of many agricultural products. The relatively small number of licensed traders and
     commission agents in these markets has not only limited farmers’ choices, but also resulted in strong political economy interests to preserve the system, and to under-investment
     in physical infrastructure. The challenge for Maharashtra is to create an environment that enables the farming community to acquire the technical capacity necessary to access
     market opportunities that result in higher returns and better incomes. The Government of Maharashtra’s long-term development plan for improving agriculture productivity and
     competitiveness includes working through the Bank-supported Maharashtra Agricultural Competitiveness Project (MACP) to implement a three-pronged approach that promotes
     the development of alternative marketing options, supports the top tier of regulated wholesale markets in the state to reform, invest, and provide better services; and gradually
     undertakes regulatory reforms. Regulatory change, investments in physical infrastructure, strengthened capacity, and improved governance, as well as the participation of all
     stakeholders (farmers, traders, commission agents, processors, and consumers) is expected to improve competitiveness.
     Project activities are grouped into three components:
     ■■     Intensification and diversification of market-led production: It supports agriculture technology transfer, facilitates networking among farmers and agribusinesses on emerg-
            ing marketing opportunities, provides market intelligence using information and communications technology-based applications and other means, and strengthens live-
            stock support services in the state.
     ■■     Improving farmer access to markets: Promotes alternative market opportunities by establishing farmer groups and a warehouse receipts system, upgrading local rural mar-
            kets, piloting e-trading platforms, and modernizing existing wholesale markets and livestock yards.
     ■■     Project management, learning, and adjusting: Undertakes project coordination and management, and monitoring and evaluation

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     Progress under agriculture marketing reforms are leading to the emergence of alternative market arrangements outside the regulated markets.
     ■■     The Project has reached and benefitted about 0.4 million direct beneficiaries. Socioeconomic screening, targeting and the beneficiary mobilization process have allowed
            significant participation of small and marginal farmers in the project activities.
     ■■     Social mobilization and capacity building has resulted in the formation of about 13,000 community level institutions (i.e. CIGs in crop and livestock sectors).
     ■■     364 farmer producer companies have been registered for the purposes of backward and forward linkages.
     ■■     The project, in partnership with eight commercial banks, facilitated about INR 7950 million of Negotiable Warehouse Receipting (NWR) funding since FY 2010-11; signifi-
            cantly the share of the NWRs issued to farmers increased from 34% to 55% and NWRs credit increased from 19 % to 39 %.
     ■■     The Agribusiness Promotion Facility (ABPF), established under the project, through the business development services has supported 794 agribusiness entrepreneurs (essen-
            tially micro and small enterprises), who have made an investment of about INR 720.00 million.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    TThe Government of Maharashtra seeks to significantly expand the frontiers of its Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector, under its 10 year vision (2012-22), with a focus on
    increasing house connection coverage, ensuring continuous water supply with adequate pressure and minimum quality standards, and ensuring that 100 percent of the rural
    population has access to safe water and basic sanitation. However, delivering this vision requires building capacities of institutions through appropriate implementation and
    management models. Maharashtra is also a rapidly urbanizing state with many large villages (each with a population of more than 10,000 people) and a growing number of
    peri-urban areas that are demanding higher levels of service. Finally, the state also faces challenges in addressing the needs of water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas,
    managing drinking water quality, and ensuring drinking water security in the face of increasing droughts and climate change impacts on rainfall patterns and the yield of existing
    sources.
    The Bank supports a portion of the broader Government of Maharashtra program over a six-year period (2014-20), focusing on two primary set of activities which address the
    underlying challenges of the sector in Maharashtra: (i) institutional capacity building for planning, implementation, and monitoring of the RWSS sector across Maharashtra; and
    (ii) in select districts, implementation of: (a) water supply and sullage management service improvement in peri-urban villages; and (b) water supply service improvement and
    improved groundwater management practices in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.
    The Program Development Objective of the World Bank’s Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program is to improve the performance of Maharashtra’s sector
    institutions in planning, implementation and monitoring of its Rural Water Supply and Sanitation program and to improve access to quality and sustainable services in peri-urban
    villages, and in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.

    The operation uses the “Program-for-Results” (PforR) financing instrument, in which funds are disbursed from the Bank only after achieving specified results. It is one of the first
    such operations in India.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
    This program for results operation is in the early stages of implementation. By the 2020 closing date, the following results are expected to be achieved:
    ■■   Strengthened sector planning and monitoring.
    ■■   Improved capacity for program implementation.
    ■■   Improved access to quality and sustainable water and sanitation services in peri-urban villages.
    ■■   Improved access to safe drinking water in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The high cost of limited regional integration and trade in the northeastern part of South Asia is clearly illustrated by the case of Mizoram state in India. Despite its potentially
     advantageous geographic location between Myanmar and Bangladesh, Mizoram in India’s Northeastern region is one of the poorest in the country, ranking 26th out of 28 states
     in terms of per capita income. Mizoram’s lagging economic development is in large part due to its landlocked location, poor infrastructure and limited linkages with the markets
     and ports of neighboring countries including Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Myanmar.
     Mizoram’s road network is poor in quality and under-developed, and has among the lowest density in all of India. Key issues and challenges in the road sector include: inadequate
     sector funding, inadequate maintenance, weak planning for investments, not the most up-to-date road engineering practices and business procedures, limited capacity of road
     agency staff, low capacity of the local construction industry, and poor road safety management.

     The development objective for Mizoram Roads II Regional Connectivity Project is to increase transport connectivity along regional trade corridors in Mizoram. With road transport
     being the only mode of transport within the state, improvements to the network should enhance the environment for development and growth by reducing freight and passenger
     transport costs while providing quicker and safer access to all parts of the state and to neighboring states and countries. The project has two components:
     ■■   Improvement of priority cross-border roads and trade-related infrastructure: Widening and strengthening 81 km of road and preparation studies for approximately 330 km
          of road, along with construction or improvement of trade-related infrastructure along project roads.
     ■■   Road sector modernization and performance enhancement through institutional strengthening: Supports gradual transformation of the Public Works Department into a
          modern road agency through implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan that will carry forward and deepen various institutional development initiatives intro-
          duced under the first Mizoram State Roads Project.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     Expected results are a 40 percent increase in traffic along project corridors and a 30 percent reduction in travel time on project corridors.
     ■■   27.5-km Champhai-Zokhawthar Road upgrading works in progress with 39.91%;
     ■■   41.7-km Chhumkhum-Chawngte Road upgrading works in progress with 25.54%;
     ■■   12-km section of Tlabung – Kawrpuichhuah Road upgrading works in progress with 15.72%;
     ■■   Detail Design reports for i) Chawngte- Diltlang- Bungtlang South- Multi Modal Road Junction (76 km); ii) Junction NH44A (Origination) – Chungtlang – Darlung – Buar-

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    In India, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) account for more than 80 percent of total industrial enterprises, produce over 8,000 value-added products, and employ
    an estimated 60 million people. MSMEs contribute around 45 percent to manufacturing output and about 40 percent to exports, both directly and indirectly. In addition, over 50
    percent of MSMEs are rural enterprises and widely distributed across low-income states, making them an important sector for promoting economic growth and poverty reduction.
    With eight million people entering the labor force every year, MSMEs have the potential to be an important source of employment and entrepreneurship, foster innovation and
    are the cradle for the government’s “Make in India” vision. Addressing the key constraints that inhibit MSMEs from accessing finance is of utmost importance. Financial institutions
    have limited their exposure to the sector due to a higher risk perception, information asymmetry, high transaction costs and the lack of collateral. The MSME census of 2006-07
    estimated that about 87 percent of MSMEs did not have any access to finance and were self-financed.

    The project focuses on expanding access to finance and innovating on financial products to respond to the changing needs of the Indian economy, address the constraints of
    MSMEs and also catalyze private-sector financing. The Project’s development objective is: “to improve access to finance of MSMEs in manufacturing and service sectors from early
    to growth stage firms, including through innovative financial products”. The higher-level objective is to support employment creation through unlocking opportunities for growth
    that the financing would provide.

    The project provides a line of credit to support MSMEs including startups through direct financing by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), an apex financial
    institution for promotion, financing and development of MSMEs, and through participating financial institutions. The focus is on three key sectors to help unlock the market for
    lending to MSMEs at all stages of growth and fits directly with the Government of India’s “Start Up India”, “Stand Up India” and “Make in India” visions: (i) start-ups and risk capital
    financing, (ii) the service sector and (iii) the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, the Project, also seeks to expand access to financing of MSMES across Low Income States and
    North-East India as well as focus on women entrepreneurs. It supports the development of innovative financial products, financing frameworks and tools that will help mitigate
    information asymmetries and keep credit risk to acceptable levels, to serve financially constrained MSMEs including startups. This is much needed to build the financing eco-
    system to cater for India’s evolving economic structure that is shifting toward technology and services, in particular early stage and startups finance, asset light models, franchisee
    financing for services, use of digital platforms to overcome information asymmetries in financial product development, leveraging big data and electronic platforms. Another focus
    is also on the development of new products relying on an innovative assessment approach to evaluate resource management efficiency for MSMEs and based on this, finance more
    resource efficient investments/manufacturing processes and practices.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■   Disbursement exceeded the target for Year 2 at $268.3 million (approximately 53 percent of project financing)
    ■■   Various PDO outcome indicators have also exceeded targets including turnover of startups supported under the project and total number of MSME beneficiaries
    ■■   Multiple TA activities have started and various intermediate outputs have been delivered such as a new Product on partnership-based lending model for startup/early stage
         financing has been conceptualized, capacity building workshops for SIDBI staff on risk capital products and stakeholders’ consultation were delivered, UI/UX design of the
         Start-Up Mitra portal (the proposed online startup lending platform) was completed, report on recommendations of FinTech solutions for SIDBI is being finalized.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project aims to contribute to overall health sector development in the state. The project development objective (PDO) is to improve health services and increase their utilization
     by communities in targeted locations in Nagaland.

     The project will support the following two components:

     Component 1. Community action for health and nutrition ($17 million). This component will support empowerment of communities to manage and monitor primary health
     facilities and motivate them to work towards the achievement of key health outcomes by providing results based incentives for the attainment of health and nutrition related
     indicators; and

     Component 2. Health system development ($42 million). This component will support improvements in the management and delivery of health services, including both targeted
     and system-wide investments.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The project was declared effective on March 20, 2017, and formally launched by the state government on June 2, 2017. It is too early to report on key results. However, the project
     is expected to achieve the following key results during implementation:
     ■■   Increase in utilization of basic health services, such as immunization, antenatal care and outpatient consultations. This is intended to reflect the results of the range of activ-
          ities in different areas supported by the project.
     ■■   Improvement in HNP-related behaviors by targeted communities (i.e. hygiene, breastfeeding and weaning practices, care and nutrition of pregnant mothers). This is an
          indicator of the results of project support to community-level activities, which will include mobilization to improve health, nutrition and hygiene-related behaviors.
     ■■   Increase in availability at targeted health facilities of reliable electricity, safe water supply and adequate sanitation. This is intended to reflect results of investments to improve
          conditions in health facilities.
     ■■   Improvement in human resource and supply chain management systems. This is intended to reflect results of project support to development of key components of the
          government health system.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The rising middle class demand for a more diverse diet, along with persistent malnutrition, increased water scarcity and climate change point to the urgency of achieving greater
     agricultural productivity, value addition and resilience. Agricultural higher education can be the engine for increasing agricultural productivity through better skilled technicians,
     innovative research and market-based extension linked to technologies and practices, all of which were common under the Land Grant model that India followed in establishing
     its Agricultural Universities (AUs). A 2014 Bank agricultural sector study finds that, while India doubled investment in agricultural research and extension (0.4% of Agriculture GDP
     in 1981 to 0.96% in 2011), the quality of innovation has suffered along with institutional capacity to adapt and remain relevant. Reawakening the “research-education-extension
     nexus” intrinsic to the Land Grant model can propel India’s agricultural innovation, farmers’ technology adoption and agriculture’s overall transformation.

     The objective of NAHEP is to support Participating Agricultural Universities and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in providing more relevant and higher quality
     education to Agricultural University students. NAHEP addresses quality by supporting interested AUs to propose and implement technically sound and verifiable investments that
     increase faculty performance, attract better students to these AUs, improve student learning outcomes and raise their prospects for future employability, particularly in the private
     sector. Relevance is addressed through: (a) greater alignment of academic curricula and course content with the skills sets being demanded in the agriculture and allied services
     sector; and (b) expanded certificate-level vocational courses to fill the gap for trained technical personnel, especially in market-led extension. The project has three components:

    The project supports the following three components:
    Component 1- Scaling Up Targeted Prevention Interventions (total estimated cost - $440 million): This component will support the scaling up of TIs with the aim of reaching
    out to the hard to reach population groups who do not yet access and use the prevention services of the program, and saturate coverage among the HRGs. In addition, this
    component will support the bridge population, i.e. migrants and truckers.
    Component 2- Behavior Change Communications (total estimated cost $40 million): This component will include communication programs for risk reduction and safe behavior
    and establish and evaluate a helpline at the national and state level to further increase access to information and services.
    Component 3- Institutional Strengthening (total estimated cost $30 million): This component will support innovations to enhance performance management including
    fiduciary management; strengthen procurement and supply chain management (including training on supply chain management); Technical Support Units (TSU); and finance
    the necessary project audits (external, internal and the audits of NGOs).

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
    The progress of the project towards achieving the development objective of “Increasing safe behavior among high risk groups in order to contribute to the national goal of reversal
    of the HIV epidemic by 2017”, is satisfactory. The project has achieved the following key results in the last 3.5 years of implementation:
    ■■   HIV estimates published on December 1, 2015 showed continued overall reduction in adult HIV prevalence from 0.34% in 2007, to 0.26% in 2015, a reduction of 24%
    ■■   The estimated annual new HIV infections (among all population) fell from 127,576 in 2007 to 86,309 in 2015, a reduction of 32% from baseline of 2007.
    ■■   Significant improvement in behavior among High risk groups (HRGs):
         •	 o	Female sex workers, about 94% reported condom use with occasional client and 91% with regular client.
         •	 o	Among Men having sex with male (MSM) groups, about 82% reported condom use with regular male partner, and 87% with paid male partner.
         •	 o	About 15% Injecting drug users have reported sharing their needles/syringes during last injection episode.
    ■■   The coverage of TIs is 69 percent coverage of FSWs against a target of 85 percent; 58.4 percent coverage of MSMs against a target of 75 percent; and 68.1 percent coverage

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides. Approximately 5,700 km of the total 7,500 km of coastline is exposed
     to severe cyclones, and an estimated 40 percent of India’s 1.2 billion people live within 100 km of the coast. Between 1980 and 2000, on average 370 million people were
     exposed to cyclones. Up to half of all tropical cyclones affecting South Asia hit the Indian coastline, which is particularly susceptible to storm surges due to a shallow coastal shelf
     and tidal characteristics. The economic impact is also considerable; studies indicate natural disaster losses of as much as 2 percent of India’s GDP and as much as 12 percent of
     federal government revenues. As the effects of climate change become more pronounced, threats are likely to increase. The National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project supports the
     Government of India in its efforts to mitigate cyclone-related risk and integrate disaster mitigation into the long-term national development process.
     The project aim is to reduce vulnerability of communities in the coastal areas. The project is the first phase of a proposed three-phased adaptable program loan. The first phase of
     the project covers the states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The project has four components:
     ■■   Early warning system and capacity building for coastal communities aims to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities by addressing the existing gaps in disseminating
          warnings to communities, and in piloting and using new technology.
     ■■   Cyclone risk mitigation infrastructure aims to improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation, and other forms of protection.
     ■■   Technical assistance for national and state level capacity building and knowledge creation to help understand risk and vulnerabilities better, and prepare key institutions to
          address them effectively.
     ■■   Project management and implementation support provides support for project management by financing incremental operating costs for the project management unit
          and implementation units, nodal units in line departments and the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), office equipment, training and exposure visits, and
          consulting services for specialist activities.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVE AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Out of 538 Multi-Purpose Cyclone Shelters –MPCS (292 NCRMP –I and 246 NCRMP-AF), 359 MPCS (270 NCRMP –I and 89 NCRMP –AF) have been completed,
     ■■   226 Cyclone Shelter Management and Maintenance Committees (CSMMCs) have been formed at the community level, 144 Village Task forces and 144 Joint accounts have
          been opened, 130 CSMMCs have been registered as societies, 80 cyclone shelter have corpus funds.
     ■■   20 bridges, 2 saline embankments and 724 kilometres (km) of evacuation roads (70448km NCRMP-I AND 20km NCRMP –AF) have been completed.
     ■■   By the year 2017, the Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coast will be covered with Early Warning Systems; 538 shelters, 1,050 km of roads, and 160 km of embankment strength-
          ening work will be completed.
     ■■   67 percent of the coastal population now has access to Multi-Purpose Cyclone Shelters.

    India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides. Approximately 5,700 km of the total 7,500 km of coastline is exposed
    to severe cyclones, and an estimated 40 percent of India’s 1.2 billion people live within 100 km of the coast. The Global Climate Change and Vulnerability Index 2011, ranked
    India second in ‘extreme risk’ countries in the world vulnerable to natural and climate change hazards. As storm surges and climate change induced sea level rise become more
    pronounced, hazard events are set to grow in frequency and intensity.

    The NCRMP is a flagship program, the first Bank funded project in India exclusively focusing on ex-ante disaster risk mitigation. The project is part of a broader national multi-
    hazard mitigation program taken up by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) that includes understanding hazards like seismic risk, floods, landslides and
    establishment of a National Disaster Management communication network. This project, along with NCRMP-I and Additional Financing, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Coastal
    Disaster Risk Reduction Project, and the Odisha Disaster Reconstruction Project, will provide support in reducing coastal vulnerability for India’s entire mainland coast.

    The NCRMP is structured in phases, based on the risk levels of the states and their implementation readiness. NCRMP Phase- I, under implementation since 2010, includes the
    states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and in NCRMP Phase-II the states of Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and West Bengal are being included. The project has four
    components:
    ■■   Early Warning Dissemination System and capacity building for coastal communities aims to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities by addressing the existing gaps
         in disseminating warnings to communities.
    ■■   Cyclone risk mitigation infrastructure aims to improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation routes, up-grading roads, bridges, embankments and bunds and under-
         ground electrical cabling.
    ■■   Technical assistance for Multi-Hazard Risk management at the national and state level capacity building and knowledge creation aims to help improve quality of information
         of multi-hazard risk for decision making. Activities include Multi-hazard risk modeling, strengthening emergency response and recovery capacity in coastal and non-coastal
         states, Hydro-meteorological resilience action plans, and design of national seismic risk mitigation program.
    ■■   Project management and implementation support by financing incremental operating costs for the project management unit and implementation units, nodal units in
         line departments and the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), office equipment, training and exposure visits, and consulting services for specialist activities.


    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■   Over 6 million people have access to 353 Multi-purpose cyclone shelters planned and access to 290 kilometers of roads and bridges
    ■■   300 kilometers of electrical cabling made resilient by transferring underground
    ■■   90 kilometers of embankments rehabilitated that will protect 20,000 hectares of coastal land
    ■■   By the end of the project the targeted coastal states will have a Hydro-meteorological Action Plan and coastal population covered by early warning dissemination system that
         reach down to the “last-mile” community.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Milk is the single largest agricultural commodity in the country in terms of value of output. Almost half of rural households depend on dairy for their livelihood. About 80 percent
     of dairy farmers are small-scale and marginal, typically owning one to three milk-producing animals (cow and buffalo). But average milk yield is low compared to international
     benchmarks, and the growth rate of domestic milk production has slowed in recent years while domestic demand continues to grow. The gap between supply and demand has
     meant rising milk prices.

     This project supports the National Dairy Plan (NDP) implemented by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). The NDP is a multi-state initiative to increase per-animal
     milk productivity, strengthen and expand village-level infrastructure for milk procurement, and enhance milk processing capacity and marketing over a 15-year horizon. With
     this project, the Bank is re-engaging in India’s dairy development by supporting the first phase of the NDP through investments designed to enhance animal productivity and
     improve farmer access to organized milk marketing channels. Increasing productivity in the Indian dairy sector can potentially contribute to improved food security and stability
     of national—and global—milk prices, as well as to improved incomes of millions of smallholder milk producers. In parallel, NDP investments are reducing the carbon footprint of
     dairy – for example, through ration balancing – while increasing per animal milk productivity. The project finances three components:
     ■■   Productivity enhancement: Increases per-animal productivity through support for improved animal breeding and nutrition.
     ■■   Milk collection and bulking: Increases market access of milk producers by investing in village-level organization and infrastructure.
     ■■   Project management and learning: Supports project management, coordination, monitoring, learning, and evaluation.

     KEY RESULTS:
     ■■   Milk production per animal reached 5.61 liters/day, equal to an 11 percent increase relative to the baseline (target is 10 percent).
     ■■   Under breed improvement activities, initial breed comparisons for performance on milk production and fat percentage are encouraging, with relatively high yields for indig-
          enous breeds under the Progeny Testing program. Conception rates under the AI program (up to 60%) are excellent.
     ■■   The Ration Balancing Program (RBP) has reduced both feed cost and methane emissions by 12% for some 1.13 million farmers.
     ■■   Fodder demonstrations – using new seed varieties, harvesting technologies and storage methods – are fundamental to increasing dairy productivity and improving adapta-
          tion to climate variability. The Project has met its targets.
     ■■   Under milk collection and bulking activities, with 26,580 villages covered (Cooperatives and Producer Companies) and 0.75 million additional producers enrolled, the Project
          is already exceeding targets.
     ■■   NDSP is empowering women and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST): 20% of Local Resource Persons under RBP are women and 15% are from SC/ST. Of total farmers
          enrolled in RBP, 32% are women and 61% are SC/ST.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Ganga River, despite being highly revered and the primary water resource for the heartland of India, is seriously polluted and under extreme environmental stress. The
    river suffers from high levels of organic and bacterial pollution, resulting in a wide range of negative impacts, including on human health, agriculture, urban services, and the
    environment. The pollution in the Ganga is primarily a result of inadequate infrastructure, the weak capacity of local water and wastewater utilities in the basin, and the poor state
    of environmental monitoring and regulation. In 2009, the Government of India developed a new vision for clean-up and conservation of the Ganga, leading to the establishment
    of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) with the mandate to develop and implement a multi-sector program. The World Bank’s National Ganga River Basin Project
    provides upstream support to the NGRBA for institutional development, program design, and early investments. This is a flagship project of the World Bank and the Government
    of India, and has high priority in India due to the scale of the challenge, and the religious, historical, and cultural importance of the Ganga River in India.

    The project development objectives are to support the NGRBA in: (i) building the capacity of its nascent operational-level institutions so they can manage the long-term Ganga
    clean-up and conservation program; and (ii) implementing a diverse set of demonstrative investments for reducing point-source pollution loads in a sustainable manner at priority
    locations on the Ganga. Project components cover:
    ■■      Institutional development: Including operationalization of the new NGRBA, communications campaigns for river cleaning, and technical assistance for city service providers
            and environmental regulators.
    ■■      Infrastructure investments in four sectors: Wastewater collection and treatment; industrial pollution control; solid waste management; and riverfront development, with
            investments to be selected according to a framework approach.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
    Key expected results are
    ■■      to lessen the volume of untreated wastewater entering the Ganga, benefitting over 3 million persons
    ■■      to increase wastewater treatment capacity
    ■■      To Increase the number of water quality monitoring stations generating real time data.
    Key achievements are:
    ■■      Two wastewater treatment plants with cumulative capacity of 34 million litres per day are already functional
    ■■      Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has commenced installation of real-time water quality data collection

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
    At the center: the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.

    KEY PARTNERS:
    Central Pollution Control Board under Ministry of Forestry and Environment. In the states: State Program Management Groups (SPMGs) in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
    Jharkhand, and West Bengal. Below the SPMGs are multiple-executing agencies, mostly large parastatals such as the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam in Uttar Pradesh, and the Bihar

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India is among the most water-stressed countries with an endowment of only 1,000 m3 of water per person a year. A large extent of the country is subject to flood and droughts.
     Rainfall is highly seasonal with fifty percent of precipitation falling in just 15 days and over 90 percent of river flows in just four months. As India develops, it will need more
     water for agriculture, energy, and industry-and for its burgeoning cities. But water balances are precarious in most basins, and the National Commission on Water predicted that
     under a business-as-usual scenario, water demands would exceed all available sources of supply by 2050. Climate change is expected to make things worse with more erratic and
     unpredictable rainfall. Addressing these challenges will require improved planning on a basin scale, which in turn is only possible with sufficient water quantity and quality data.
     The National water information system, modelling expertise, and the technical and institutional capacity for water resources planning and management need to be strengthened
     across India. The World Bank supported Hydrology Project Phase I (P010485, IDA $94.95 million and Phase II (P084632, IBRD $91.58 million) have supported the establishment
     of a hydrological information system in a number of States mainly in southern India. National and state governments are now committed to building a comprehensive national
     Water Resources Information System to support integrated river basin management.

     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the extent, quality, and accessibility of water resources information and to strengthen the capacity of targeted water
     resources management institutions in India. The Project has a pan India coverage and is being implemented by 49 Implementing Agencies (IAs) both at central and state levels.
     Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD& GR) is the lead agency.

     The Project has adopted a four-pronged approach: (a) modernizing monitoring, including establishing comprehensive, nationwide, automated, real-time monitoring and
     data management systems for surface water and groundwater (both quality and quantity); (b) enhancing analytical tools for water resources assessment, hydrologic and flood
     inundation forecasting, water infrastructure operations, groundwater modeling, and river basin and investment planning; (c) transforming knowledge access, using cloud
     computing, Internet, mobile devices, social media and other communication tools to modernize access to and visualization of customized water information by all stakeholders;
     and (d) modernizing institutions through investments in people and institutional capacity.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
     The main results expected at the end of the project include:
     ■■      National Water resources information system integrated with State information centers and providing reliable data online with easy access to stakeholders.
     ■■      Streamflow forecasting system linked with climate forecast and providing advance warning for reservoir operation and preparedness of climate extremes.
     ■■      The online platform for River basin developed and providing regular water accounting and water availability.
     ■■      At least 25 out of 42 agencies (state water resource departments and River basin organization) are improved with hydromet data centers and using river basin planning and
             water management tools.
     Achievement to date includes:

     In order to facilitate the integration of data at National level, all the agencies have signed memorandum of agreement with MoWR, RD&GR. The preliminary flood forecasting
     system has been set this year which will be further tested and improved in coming years. The ministry is working on strengthening the national water information center which
     will finally coordinate the development of information system and as well as tools for river basin planning and management all over the country.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     There are total of 49 implementing agencies including water resources and groundwater departments from central and states.

     Lead agency: ministry of water resources, river development and ganga rejuvenation.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Government of India is keen to sustain its achievements in economic growth, which has been at 8 percent per annum in recent years. Improving the level and quality of
    infrastructure services will be critical for this goal. National highways (82,755 km) account for only 1.9 percent of the total road length in the country, but carry over 40 percent of
    the total road traffic. While the government invested significantly in the core national highways under the NHDP, the remaining 43 percent of the national highway network have
    not received adequate funding until recently. Considerable stretches of the non-NHDP network require strengthening and upgrading, and suffer from major connectivity gaps.
    In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of the non-NHDP network. It holds the key to ease poverty and share prosperity, and for achieving the
    government’s objective of equitable and inclusive growth, as it often serves as the primary or sole link with remote, economically lagging, or otherwise challenged regions. The
    government has identified a portion of non-NHDP roads for priority development through external financing and budgetary allocations.
    The project development objective is to improve national highway network connectivity to less-developed areas and low-income states, and enhance the institutional capacity of
    the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to better manage the highway network. The project consists of three components:
    ■■   A road improvement and maintenance component to upgrade and maintain national highways in three low-income states (Bihar, Orissa and Rajasthan) and less-developed
         regions in two middle-income states (Karnataka and West Bengal).
    ■■   An institutional development component to enhance the institutional capacity of MoRTH to better manage its highway network through supporting specific interventions in
         the areas of: process improvements; network monitoring and management; financing; governance and accountability; and training.
    ■■   A road safety component working on updating Indian standards and regulations related to road safety; improving road accident data collection and analysis at the central
         level and in project states; strengthening road safety capacity at the central level; and promoting social marketing and awareness campaigns along project roads.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    About 1,120 km of existing single/intermediate lane roads will be upgraded to two-lane standard, and maintained for five years after construction. More specific expected results
    include:
    Increase in the length of non-NHDP national highways in good and fair condition from 65 percent to 68.25 percent.

    On project roads, percent reduction in average travel time and average vehicle operating cost; no increase in fatalities in road crashes.
    Improved accident data management system and asset management system developed and implemented in at least three states.

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
    Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Despite high GDP growth rate over the past decade, over 250 million rural people in India (45 million households) remain locked in poverty, living on less than $1 per day. Rural
     livelihoods programs are designed to help tackle this immense development challenge.
     The Bank’s engagement on rural livelihood programs dates back to a series of projects in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan started in 2000. Since
     then, the Bank has invested more than a $1 billion in 11 livelihood projects at the state level. Thirty million rural poor have been mobilized to form their own institutions, enabling
     them to access livelihood opportunities and build social, financial, and economic capital. The rural poor have been empowered socially and economically, enabling them to
     build linkages with state and market institutions. They have higher savings, more access to credit, livelihoods and public services, and households and communities benefit from
     increased public and private investment. The National Rural Livelihoods Project supports the Government of India’s efforts to scale up these state-level interventions to the national
     level through support to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)—Aajeevika. Bank financing supports the program in 13 high poverty (also mostly low-income) states.
     The project’s development objective is to establish efficient and effective institutional platforms for the rural poor that enable them to increase household income through
     sustainable livelihood enhancements and improved access to financial and selected public services. Project components cover:
     ■■ Institutional and human capacity development: to transform the role of the Ministry of Rural Development into that of providing high-quality technical assistance in the field
          of rural livelihoods promotion.
     ■■ State livelihood support to help state governments in establishing necessary institutional structures and mechanisms to implement NRLM activities from the state- to the
          block-level, including support to forming institutions for the rural poor.
     ■■ Innovation and partnership support: to create an institutional mechanism to identify, nurture, and support innovative ideas from across the country to address the livelihood
          needs of the rural poor.
     Project implementation support to strengthen the national mission management unit for effective project management at the national level to develop key systems and processes
     to coordinate and manage the project and the NRLM.
     The project has been restructured three times. As part of the first restructuring the credit amount was reduced to $500 million. Subsequently, after the mid-term review the project
     was restructured on a second occasion to create dedicated funds for livelihoods; Financial Inclusion; Convergence and Skills. Results framework was also suitably modified to
     incorporate the changes. The third restructuring of the project was about change in the financing share with the WB share reducing to 60% from 70%. This was necessitated by the
     change in financing pattern of all central government programs.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
     Expected results:
     ■■   About 6 million identified rural poor households will be mobilized into community institutions, $100 million in cumulative savings would be made by rural poor households
          through thrift, $500 million in bank credit would be leveraged by rural poor households from the formal financial sector, one million rural poor households would have
          improved farm productivity, livestock productivity, and market access, and 500,000 new jobs would be created for the poor.
     Achievements to date:
     ■■   As of mid 2017, project works in 571 blocks in 161 districts, across 13 high-poverty states.
     ■■   The project works with over 7.5 million poor households, mobilised into 650,000 self-help groups. These self-help groups are further federated into 41,000 village-level
          organisations and 2,568 cluster-level federations.
     ■■   Through NRLP’s total investment of $399 million, an estimated $1,593 million has been invested into poor rural households. This estimate includes savings mobilised by
          self-help group members worth $166 million and the institutional credit worth $607 million leveraged from commercial banks.
     ■■   In addition, through the creation of dedicated funds, the NRLP has invested in new economic transformative initiatives that include; development of producer organisations
          in sector-specific economic clusters, digital financial services and expanding community’s access to and use of government human development programs and services.
          Nearly 12 producer companies have been developed covering 156,000 small-holder farmers thus far. Through the financial inclusion dedicated fund, ten states have trained
          nearly 500 self- help group women to become business correspondents that are providing services to 55,000 households.

     KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
     The project recognizes partnerships as key implementation arrangements and encourages the states to directly access technical and knowledge support from reputed resource
     organizations, especially in the following areas: Partnerships with home-grown models like International Fund for Agriculture Development/DFID/East Asia and Pacific, sharing the
     same ethos. Some of the ongoing partners include MAVIM, OTELP, JTELP, WDC, and NGOs with track records. Knowledge partners for programmatic verticals like BIRD (Financial
     Services), NABARD, PRADAN (Agriculture and Ecological Services), BAIF (Livestock), Landesa (Land Access), and FAO (Agriculture and Livestock).

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The project would enhance the impacts of the Government of India’s Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) operations in targeted watersheds, chiefly through
    intensive technical assistance. Support would: (i) introduce landscape-level assessment and planning as a window for better program convergence; (ii) strengthen participatory,
    evidence-based micro-watershed planning; (iii) improve program monitoring and evaluation; (iv) expand knowledge sharing and transfer of new science-based innovations into
    watershed management; (v) support a stronger focus on improving agricultural productivity and market linkages; (vi) strengthen watershed institutions at the national, state, and
    community level; and (vii) improve program equity and sustainability. The project would cover 400 sub-watersheds and two million hectares across the eight states, and reach
    approximately 482,000 farmer households and 2 million people.

    The development objective is to support IWMP through technical assistance to improve incremental conservation outcomes and agricultural yields for communities in selected
    sites, and adoption of more effective processes and technologies. Its four components are:
    ■■   Central institutional and capacity building: Strengthens institutions and human resources of key national stakeholders, particularly the Department of Land Resources, for
         more effective planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of watershed management programs.
    ■■   National innovation support: Supports the application of innovative, science-based knowledge, tools and approaches to underpin improvements to IWMP around watershed
         planning and implementation, agricultural intensification, climate change, rural livelihoods and hydrology, based on identified needs of the states, communities, and
         farmers.
    ■■   IWMP implementation support in participating states: Provides intensive, science-based technical assistance to improve IWMP operational effectiveness, convergence/
         integration with other government programs, and measurable impacts on the ground in selected sites in participating states.
    ■■   Project management and coordination: Finances management and implementation costs, including specialized incremental staff costs (both full and part-time), incremental
         operating costs for travel (per World Bank norms), meetings, financial management, internal/external audit and procurement, equipment, and project management consul-
         tancies

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    Achievements to date are focused largely on developing capacities for implementation across DoLR and the nine participating states; these include:
    ■■   Establishing functional project management units in DoLR and states;
    ■■   Engaging the National Institute of Hydrology as an implementing partner;
    ■■   Completion and approval of all procurement plans;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project supports six states in the north eastern region of India to augment their transmission and distribution (T&D) networks and strengthen the capacity of the state-
     level institutions in extending last mile electricity connections to households. The project will help improve power supply to a region whose economic development has been
     constrained by power shortages, and where electricity consumption is less than a third of the national average. The existing power network infrastructure in these states is old and
     has not been adequately maintained. This makes it prone to high technical and non-technical losses, and leads to frequent interruptions and outages in power supply. In addition,
     most of the utilities incur commercial losses due to inadequate cost structures and tariffs.

     The project will strengthen and augment the intrastate transmission, sub-transmission, and distribution networks by upgrading old and constructing new lines and associated
     substations in the six participating states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. These investments will allow the transmission network to transfer
     electricity more efficiently and with minimum wastage, and help the utilities supply reliable electricity at a stable voltage to consumers.
     The project will be implemented through POWERGRID, which has been appointed as the implementing agency by the Government of India and it will provide technical and
     managerial support for improving intra-state transmission and distribution systems in these states. After commissioning, the assets created under the project will be owned,
     operated and maintained by the respective state power utilities and departments. POWERGRID will also help build the capacity of the state departments and utilities to continue
     managing the refurbished networks in an optimum and efficient manner.

     The development objective is to increase the delivery of electricity at the boundaries of the power distribution network in the participating states in the North Eastern Region. The
     project has two components:
     ■■   Priority Investments for Strengthening Intrastate Transmission, Sub-transmission, and Distribution Systems.
     ■■   Technical Assistance for Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening (CBIS) of Power Utilities and Departments of Participating States

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     Progress toward the achievement of the project’s development objective will be measured by following indicators:
     ■■   Increase in the amount of electricity delivered at the boundaries of the power distribution network in each state;
     ■■   Increase in transformation capacity of the power T&D network in each state.
     In addition, the following intermediate indicators will be used to monitor progress:
     ■■   Transmission or distribution lines constructed or rehabilitated;
     ■■   number of grid or distribution substations constructed or upgraded;
     ■■   number of practice/process manuals updated or developed;
     ■■   person-days of utility staff participating in trainings;

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    On October 12, 2013, Cyclone Phailin hit a densely populated area of the state of Odisha, with 4.5 million people in the path of wind gusts up to 220 kilometers per hour. It was
    the strongest cyclone to hit the Indian coast in 14 years: a category 4 storm similar to the Super Cyclone 05B of 1999 that hit Odisha and killed more than 10,000 people, destroyed
    275,000 homes and left 1.67 million homeless. Due to a highly successful and unprecedented government response, only about 44 people died in Cyclone Phailin, but the impact
    on coastal residents was extreme, particularly in the districts of Ganjam (where the cyclone made landfall), Puri, and Khordha. Damage was estimated at about US$1.45 billion,
    including US$480 million needed for housing reconstruction.
    The Odisha Disaster Recovery Project aims to restore and improve housing and public services in targeted communities of Odisha, and increase the government’s capacity to
    respond promptly and effectively to future emergencies. This project is part of a broader package to support the Government of Odisha’s reconstruction and recovery efforts and to
    strengthen their capacity to manage future events. The project has five components:
    ■■   Resilient housing reconstruction and community infrastructure: Focuses on the immediate reconstruction of damaged housing, restoration of public buildings and public
         service networks using resilient construction standards, and development of village development plans.
    ■■   Urban infrastructure in Berhampur: Focuses on Berhampur, the largest city in Ganjam district, to improve public services while at the same time reducing their vulnerability.
         It includes the upgrading of affected slums and technical assistance for the Berhampur Municipal Corporation to improve resilience of public services and urban planning.
    ■■   Capacity building in disaster risk management: Strengthens the state’s capacity in risk mitigation, preparedness, and disaster response.
    ■■   Implementation: Supports the incremental operating costs of the project, including training, exposure visits, and knowledge exchange programs for the Odisha State Disas-
         ter Management Agency (OSDMA) and Berhampur Municipal Corporation.
    ■■   Contingency emergency response: Can be triggered at the request of the government, following an adverse natural event that causes a major natural disaster to re-allocate
         project funds to support response and reconstruction.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   16,573 houses are planned for reconstruction in the districts of Ganjam and Khurda. Out of which 15,463 (93.3%) houses have been completed and occupied. 12,479 (75%)
         have built toilets.
    ■■   15,415 (93%) houses have been insured against multiple hazards including during construction
    ■■   2,300 families learned skills through Mason Training.
    ■■   By the end of the project, the Berhampur Municipal Corporation will have a raw water transmission main, about 8 km improved roads, and about 15 km of improved drains.
    ■■   OSDMA will have an established Emergency Operations Center with trained staff and systems in place to plan for and respond to disasters.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Energy efficiency is one of the most cost-effective options for India, to reduce energy costs, deliver increased economic productivity and competitiveness, increase energy security,
     and mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases. It is estimated that if India improves energy efficiency by 15% over the next decade, it could save $32 billion per annum and 15 GW
     by 2023. Under the Government of India’s National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE), the energy efficiency market is estimated to be US$10 billion across demand
     side sectors (industries, MSMEs, public buildings, municipalities) but that remains largely untapped as most of the end users are unable to implement projects on a large scale,
     because of the lack technical capacity or financial credibility to borrow for energy efficiency investments. Domestic banks do not lend to smaller/mid-tier end users or to energy
     service companies (ESCOs) due to perceived risks. PRSF project was specifically designed to address these and create a market where it did not exist, by guaranteeing loans to
     ESCO-implemented projects.
     The project’s development objective is to assist India in achieving energy savings with mobilization of commercial finance and participation of ESCOs. As a pilot-scale engagement
     co-financed by CTF and GEF, a $ 37m partial risk sharing facility and associated $6m TA are designed to address barriers that impede large scale deployment of energy efficiency
     technologies that are not being financed by the domestic financial institutions due to perceived risks. It is aimed at mobilizing over $100m of private sector investments and
     catalyzing the scaling up of energy savings performance contracting market through ESCOs. More details at http://prsf.sidbi.in

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   860 GWh of annual energy savings achieved by projects that receive PRSF risk coverage
     ■■   630,000 tons of CO2 emissions mitigated annually by projects that receive PRSF risk coverage
     ■■   A Total number of 460 ESCO-implemented energy efficiency investments whose loans receive credit guarantee from PRSF
     ■■   US$100 million total private capital mobilized

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a flagship programme of the Government of India (GOI) for empowering rural India (about 70 percent of country’s population
    still live in villages) through the provision of all-weather road access to all habitations in the country above 500 population (250 in special areas). The programme is being
    implemented by a dedicated agency at the centre level i.e. National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) under the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). Since its
    inception in the year 2000, an investment of about Rs.1400 billion has been made resulting in providing connectivity to about 116,310 habitations (out of 178,000 eligible
    habitations). About 472,685 km of rural roads have been constructed / upgraded under this programme. The program’s implementation capacity has been enhanced over time,
    with about 52,400 km being completed annually, compared to just 15,500 at the beginning of the program. However, even after 15 years of the programme, PMGSY has only
    achieved 79 percent of its initial targets and more than 20 per cent of the population still lack access to all-weather roads. The Bank’s $1.4 billion PMGSY Rural Roads Project covers
    a mixture of low-income states (Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), small special category upland states (Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Uttarakhand), and the
    middle-income state of Punjab.

    The project development objective is to support strengthening the systems and processes of the national PMGSY rural roads program to expand and maintain all-season rural
    access roads, resulting in enhanced road connectivity to economic opportunities and social services for beneficiary communities in the participating states. The project is structured
    around two components: (a) to cover civil works expenditures in the seven participating states associated with providing new all-season access to unconnected habitations, and
    upgrading important link routes in rural areas (b) providing technical assistance support to strengthen the capacity of relevant agencies to implement the program, including
    support for further enhancements to the On-line Management, Monitoring, and Accounting System to produce customized performance reporting at the national, state, and
    district levels. The reports will incorporate improved safeguards monitoring information and vulnerability-disaggregated data (including by gender), as well as data derived from
    third-party monitoring.

    The closing date of the Project has been extended by four months, from June 30, 2017 to October 31, 2017, in order to fully implement key institutional development initiatives
    on road maintenance, road safety, GIS, outcome monitoring, and capacity building, that have already been initiated.

    KEY RESULTS:
    ■■    About 90 per cent of the target habitations under PMGSY have been connected in the participating states against a target of 72 per cent.
    ■■    The condition of PMGSY roads has improved. Road condition is measured through a Pavement Condition Index (PCI), which is a five-point scale where a number of two or
          lower is considered a satisfactory condition. Currently, about 64 per cent of rural roads are having a PCI of more than 2 against a target of 55 per cent.
    ■■    All 25,576 km roads under the project involving an expenditure of INR 89,000 million have been completed and opened to traffic.
    ■■    About 19 states have established road maintenance policies. MORD has also adopted a national training framework to build capacity of rural road agencies as well as the
          construction industry to introduce best practice examples in the rural roads.
    ■■    The Bank has undertaken a detailed assessment of PMGSY, supported development of environmentally optimized road designs, a national training framework for PMGSY,
          and an asset management strategy for rural roads using the Aus-Aid TF.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Punjab state had implemented a $154 million Rural Water Project during 2007-14 that demonstrated good service levels through community management while achieving
     close to 100 percent coverage of water supply. However, the state faces challenges of poor access: less than 30 percent households have water connections and 600,000 households
     do not have access to sanitation facilities. This is mainly impacting women, children and marginalized communities. The state government intends to scale up and consolidate
     the gains of the first project by adopting a demand responsive and decentralized service delivery approach to progressively raise the water and sanitation service standards and
     coverage, and also reform the service delivery institutions.
     The present Rural Water Sector Improvement Project has a development objective to improve water and sanitation service levels, reduce open defecation, and strengthen service
     delivery arrangements in targeted villages in Punjab. The project has six components:
     ■■   Augmentation and operational improvement of existing water supply schemes to deliver better service levels through community management in 970 villages;
     ■■   Sewerage schemes in 315 villages;
     ■■   650,000 individual household water connections
     ■■   Addressing water quality issues such as contamination with heavy metals in 271 villages;
     ■■   Making the state Open Defecation Free (ODF) though supporting beneficiaries to build individual household toilets (620,000) complimented with behavior change activities
          ($60 million).
     ■■   Reforming the sector institution for improved service delivery and project management ($49 million),

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■   545 villages with higher service levels managed by the Gram Panchayat Water Sanitation Committees
     ■■   2,397 village committees that are managing operations and maintenance of water supply schemes through full cost recovery
     ■■   2,699 of 13,561 villages achieved 100% household water supply connections
     ■■   204,125 number of household toilets have been completed
     ■■   6,537 of 13,561 villages declared open defecation free and 10 of 22 districts are Open Defecation Free.
     ■■   455 Water Quality affected villages are receiving improved quality of water
     ■■   324,782 are new piped household water connections that are resulting from the project intervention

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The desert state of Rajasthan faces acute water quantity and quality issues. Covering 10 percent of India’s land area and accounting for 5 percent of the population, Rajasthan
    has less than 2 percent of the country’s water resources. Erratic rainfall and recurring droughts have exacerbated the situation. A large part of the state relies on groundwater for
    agriculture, and for industrial and domestic consumption, which has negative impacts on the quality and quantity of groundwater. Sustainable and efficient use of the state’s scarce
    water resources is a major challenge. Given the size of the agriculture sector and its water footprint, improved water and agriculture productivity coupled with market linkages
    are key elements for sustainable and inclusive growth. While there are many challenges to making the semi-arid dessert bloom, there are also significant opportunities: (i) a
    promising potential for diversification into higher-value, less water-consuming horticulture, floriculture, spice and medicinal plant production; (ii) scope for livestock development
    focusing on improved breeding, animal health, nutrition, and access to markets; (iii) availability of a range of tested on-farm water management technologies and agronomic
    practices; (iv) a policy framework that is increasingly conducive to private sector-led, sustainable agriculture, including recently revised state policies on agriculture, livestock, and
    agribusiness development, as well as water resources management; and (v) the possibility of scaling up experience in PPPs in agriculture.
    The development objective of the project is to establish the feasibility of sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and farmer incomes through a distinct agricultural
    development approach that integrates agriculture water management and agricultural technology, farmer organizations, and market innovations in selected locations across the
    10 agro-ecological zones of Rajasthan. The project has four components:
    ■■   Climate resilient agriculture: Supports climate-resilient approaches for sustainable use of the natural resource base, through agricultural and livestock production systems
         aiming to increase long-term productivity and farm incomes in an environment marked by increased climate and rainfall variability. Activities include: (i) harvest, capture,
         collection, delivery, and distribution of water for agriculture and livestock purposes in surface water-irrigated canal command areas, groundwater sources, and rain-fed areas;
         (ii) on-farm water use efficiency; (iii) soil moisture and fertility improvements; (iv) sustainable intensification and diversification of farm production; and (v) integrated crop
         and livestock farming systems.
    ■■   Markets and value chains: Will enable farmers to engage in profitable and sustainable market-oriented production, and promote partnerships and market linkages with
         other value chain participants and agribusinesses.
    ■■   Farmer’s organizations and capacity building: Supports: (i) establishment of farmer groups and organizations; (ii) capacity building for participatory planning and plan
         implementation of collective actions; and (iii) strengthening institutions and human resources associated with the project implementation.
    ■■   Monitoring and evaluation, and learning: Aims to implement robust monitoring and evaluation systems, which will support potentially scaling up successful approaches
         across the state. Work will also focus on strengthening synergies, and convergence with ongoing schemes of the government of Rajasthan and the Government of India.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
    By the end of the project in 2019, it is expected that:
    ■■   Water used in agriculture will be reduced by 15 percent (from 3,000 cum to 2,550 cum per gross irrigated area).
    ■■   Water use efficiency will increase by 65 percent over the baseline.
    ■■   Agriculture and livestock productivity will increase from 33-75%, relative to baseline

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Rajasthan has good potential for growth in agriculture and agro-based industries, mining and minerals processing, tourism, handicrafts and cottage industries, but this potential is
     unrealized due to inadequate road infrastructure and market linkages. Rajasthan has a road network of 193,017 km, including 7,260 km of National Highways (NH), 10,953 km of
     State Highways (SH), 9,900 km of Major District Roads (MDR), 25,033 km of Other District Roads (ODR) and 139,871 km of Village/Rural Roads. Due to years of under-investment
     and inadequate maintenance, many of the State Highways and MDRs are in poor condition in terms of quality, shape, pavement strength, drainage, and safety. They are disjointed
     due to missing links and dilapidated bridges. Only about 11 percent of SHs and MDRs are double lane. The road safety situation in Rajasthan is serious and deteriorating. It
     ranks fifth in the total number of fatalities in 2011, making up 6.5% of all fatalities in India. The Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) PMGSY provided all weather road
     connectivity to about 81% of eligible habitations having above 500 people and to habitations having 250 people in desert and tribal areas of the state.
     The project development objective is to improve rural connectivity, enhance road safety and strengthen road sector management capacity of the state of Rajasthan. The project’s
     components are:
     ■■   Support construction of about 2500 km rural roads to provide connectivity to about 1,300 revenue villages with population between 250 and 499 people in the areas of the
          state not covered by PMGSY and introduce good practices of cost effective technologies for low volume roads..
     ■■   Support implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan (RSMP) in the areas of: (i)Improved policy framework; (ii) Modernization of Engineering Practices and Business
          Procedures; (iii) Sustainable Asset Management; (iv) Institutional and Human Resource Development; (v) Enhancing Governance & Accountability in Public Works Depart-
          ment.
     ■■   Support implementation of Road Safety Management through: (i) Piloting Safe Corridor Demonstration Program (SCDP); (ii) Road Safety Awareness Program; and (iii) Provi-
          sion of Road Safety Equipment for Police and Transport.
     Restructuring: A project restructuring dated August 25, 2017 was carried out to make the following changes to the project:

     (i) Increased share of works component from 70% to 80% retroactively to ensure the overall WB share is kept at 80%
     (ii) Revision to the results monitoring framework to monitor the achievements against the project objectives and ensuring linkages between the activities, outcomes and outputs.

     (iii) Reallocation of the unutilized balance allotted towards refinancing of the PPA

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■   An increased share of rural population with access to an all-season road; 993 number of villages, 360,736 total number of people connected to the road network
     ■■   An increased size of total classified network; 2,225 km (of 2521 km) of rural roads added to the network

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Rajasthan is India’s largest state in terms of area and 8th of 28 states in terms of both population and state GDP. More than three-quarters of its population lives in rural areas.
    Despite a rapid decline in poverty from 50% in 1970 to 24% in 2005, to about 15% in 2011-12, the absolute number of the poor still stands at ten million as per the 2011
    census. The RRLP focuses on 17 districts in Southern and Eastern Rajasthan with relatively higher incidence of poverty. The Project Development Objective is to enhance economic
    opportunities and empowerment of the rural poor, with a focus on women and marginalized groups, in the 17 targeted districts of Rajasthan. The project has four components:
    ■■   The Institution Building and Social Empowerment component helps the poor mobilize themselves into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and develop their capacity to initiate and
         expand sustainable livelihoods activities.
    ■■   The Community Investment Support component supports asset creation of self-help groups and their federations; and identifies and supports innovative approaches to
         improve livelihoods of the rural poor.
    ■■   The Skill Development and Employment Promotion component supports beneficiaries to connect to new employment opportunities through the creation of a structured
         mechanism for skill development and job creation.
    ■■   The Project Implementation Support component facilitates various implementation, coordination, learning and quality enhancement efforts.


    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   49,438 self-help groups (SHGs) have been mobilized, which exceeds the project end goal of 33,000 SHGs. 53% of these SHGs have been graded on quality parameters, out
         of which 64% have achieved the top (A) grade
    ■■   38,465 SHGs have received the first tranche of Community Investment Funds (CIF) and 30,238 SHGs have received both the first and second tranche of project financing
         respectively. Additionally, 18,269 SHGs have been linked to commercial bank credit mobilizing $17 million in commercial bank loans to poor households.
    ■■   3,568 Village Organizations (VOs) and 130 Cluster Level Federations (CLFs) – federated community organizations of SHGs at the village and block level respectively – have
         been formed. Of the 79% VOs graded on quality of operations, 89% have achieved the top (A) grade
    ■■   Approximately 500,000 total households have been mobilized in the project, 47% belong to Scheduled Tribes, 18% belong to Scheduled Castes, and 29% belong to other
         backward classes
    ■■   78,685 households are receiving support in the form of livelihoods interventions including crop, vegetable and dairy clusters; farmer producer organizations, micro-enter-
         prises etc.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India’s Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has prioritized four states (Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh) as a Phase I special focus program for rural water and
     sanitation in low-income states. The piped water and sanitation coverage in these four states is extremely low. Access to household piped water in Assam is 6.8 percent; Bihar 2.6
     percent; Jharkhand 3.7 percent; and Uttar Pradesh 20.2 percent. Of these, Bihar, Jharkhand and UP also lag significantly in sanitation, with more than 75 % of the rural households
     not having access to latrines within premises.

     The project development objective is to improve piped water supply and sanitation services for selected rural communities in the target states through decentralized delivery
     systems and to increase the capacity of the participating states to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project has four components:
     ■■   Capacity building and sector development will support the building of institutional capacity for implementing project activities, along with sector development studies to
          inform policy decisions.
     ■■   Infrastructure development will support investments for improving water supply and sanitation coverage, including construction of new infrastructure and rehabilitation and
          augmentation of existing schemes.
     ■■   Project management support includes project management support to the various entities at the national, state, district, and village levels for implementing the project.
     ■■   Contingency emergency response

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   1.5 million new piped household water connections will be made.
     ■■   2.7 million people will be using improved latrines in the project areas.
     ■■   Operation and maintenance cost recovery across habitations in the project area will increase.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The government of Kerala has significantly improved rural water supply coverage, from 58.6 percent in 2003 to 67.7 percent by 2010. Kerala has also achieved impressive
    coverage of household sanitation: 95 percent of rural households have access to a toilet facility, and 87 percent of Gram Panchayats (GPs) have received the Government of India’s
    “Clean Village Award” for 100 percent ODF status. Nevertheless, rural households disproportionally remain without adequate water supply, and the access gap between rural and
    urban areas needs to be bridged. The gap is particularly acute in remote villages and areas with low quantity and poor quality of water. Challenges include: increasing presence
    of fluoride, iron, and salinity; contamination of private drinking wells due to poor sanitation; emergence of water-stressed areas where demand outstrips local supply; increasing
    numbers of “slipped back” habitations; continued dependence of large number of households on private open wells that dry up in the summer; and low coverage of household
    connections from piped water systems.
    The development objective of the Second Kerala Rural Water and Sanitation Project (also known as Jalanidhi II) is to increase the access of rural communities to improved and
    sustainable water supply and sanitation services in Kerala, using a decentralized, demand-responsive approach. The project has three components:
    ■■   Institution building, which supports the capacity building of sector institutions and support organizations, assists the Government of Kerala in implementing a statewide
         sector-development program, and supports project management costs.
    ■■   Technical assistance, which provides technical assistance to implementing agencies to ensure that infrastructure investments under the third component are properly imple-
         mented and resulting services efficiently provided.
    ■■   Infrastructure development, which finances investments for: (i) new and rehabilitated intra-GP rural water supply schemes; (ii) pilot rehabilitation and modernization of
         multi-GP water supply schemes and transfer of internal distribution to GPs; and (iii) sanitation schemes, mainly covering community-centric solid and liquid waste manage-
         ment and household sanitation solutions in difficult terrain.

    KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.
    Water supply interventions under the project will benefit some 288,000 households, and some 690,000 people will benefit from improved sanitation services.

    Achievements include
    ■■   1,536,000 direct project beneficiaries (of which 50.5 percent are women, 45 percent are below the poverty line, 9.5 percent are members of Scheduled Castes, and 7.5
         percent are members of Scheduled Tribes) will be covered by the project through improved water supply and sanitation.
    ■■   1,504 water supply schemes have been completed and commissioned; of which 352 are rehabilitated schemes. Three large multi-GP scheme covering twelve GPs in Trichur
         and Malapuram districts are in an advanced stage of completion. Additional large water supply schemes have been initiated by the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
         Agency (KRWSA) and Kerala Water Authority (KWA).
    ■■   The total of water supply household connections provided is 111,338.
    ■■   The state has achieved Open Defecation Free status in 2016. This project supported construction of 36,376 toilets. Including other sanitation facilities, a total of 0.35 million
         persons benefited from access to improved sanitation facilities.
    ■■   Some GPs are undertaking ground water recharge activities through convergence of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and project
         resources.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     As per estimates of the Central Electricity Authority, India is expected to observe an average peak surplus (measured in megawatts, MW) at 2.6 percent while average energy
     surplus (measured in million units) at 1.1 percent in the fiscal year (FY) 2017. However, the electricity supply to the end consumers is still unreliable due to poor performance of
     India’s heavily indebted electricity distribution companies or ‘discoms’. Solar photovoltaics (PV) has emerged as a promising long-term option to meet India’s growing energy
     demand while addressing the adverse environmental impacts of conventional fuels. The Government of India (GOI) has announced a bold target of installing 100 gigawatts (GW)
     of solar power out of a total renewable energy target of 175 GW by 2022. Of these, 40 GW, increased from 20 GW in February 2017, will be installed in solar parks, which are
     concentrated zones of solar power generation projects that provide developers a well-characterized area, with appropriate infrastructure and access to amenities, where project
     risks can be minimized. Considering the above background and investment needs of the sector, the GOI requested the World Bank’s support through this project in helping it
     achieve its targets of solar-power capacity in India by 2022.
     The borrower is Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) acting as a nodal project implementing agency (PIA) while passing the funds onwards to the state level
     agencies for on the ground investments under the project. The development objective of the project is to increase solar generation capacity through the establishment of large-
     scale solar parks in the country. The project has two components. First component, shared infrastructure for solar parks will cover financing for shared infrastructure, such as, access
     roads, water supply and drainage, telecommunications, pooling station inside the solar parks and transmission lines connecting these internal pooling stations to the external
     substation that may or may not be at the periphery of the park, feeding into the national or state grid. Second component, technical assistance will provide capacity -building
     support to IREDA, the state nodal agencies where selected solar parks are/will be located, and the selected state PIAs/Solar Energy Corporation of India.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■   The project aims to support generation of 1,750 MW of renewable energy, enabling reduction of GHG emissions of 6,300 tons by 2022.
     ■■   The project is funding the shared infrastructure facilities in 750 MW Rewa Solar Park and 250 MW Mandsaur Solar Park, both in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Specifically, the
          Rewa Solar Park has set the milestones in the solar sector in the country by not only discovering the lowest tariff (at that time, of about $.05 per unit) but also has informed
          the design of future solar projects in India.

     *$ millions; As of June 23, 2017.


    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    At present, 4.9 percent of the working age population (15 to 59 years) is unemployed in India; more than 70 percent of the workforce is employed by firms with fewer than
    10 employees. Only 31 percent of women participate in the labor force. Growth and diversification of the Indian economy have resulted in major shifts in the labor force from
    agriculture to the service and manufacturing sectors. India’s growth and competitiveness are constrained by the low skill levels of its population. The country has a substantial
    challenge ahead as the government reports that only 2.3 percent of the total workforce in India has undergone formal skill training, In addition, the skills forecast study indicates
    that 298.25 million members of the current farm and nonfarm sector workforce will need to be skilled, re-skilled, and/or up-skilled to increase labor productivity.

    SIMO is $250 million World Bank support program to Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). The objective of SIMO is to enhance institutional mechanisms
    for skill development and increase access to quality and market-relevant training for workforce. The project seeks to revamp the skill development system through (i) strengthened
    institutional mechanisms for improve skill development policies, national qualification frameworks, quality assurance mechanisms, (ii) supporting financial incentives to states
    to encourage relevant skills formation and continuous upgrading of labor market competencies, (iii) strengthen systemic capacities to finance, deliver, evaluate and accredit
    programs that lead to certification of occupational standards at the national and state levels to improve the quality of trainees especially women and disadvantaged sections in
    the labor force and (iv) encourage private sector support through strategic deployment of private support for skill development initiatives. States will be graded on a performance
    based grading/scoring pattern of the State Incentive Grant for SIMO financing. One of the key strategies to achieve the objectives of the program is to enhance the industry
    participation in the skilling initiatives, through “Skills Fund”, a funding mechanism in which the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds provided by the private sector will be
    matched by government funds for joint public-private investment in key skill development priorities.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
    ■■   Institutional Strengthening at National and State Levels for Planning, Delivering, and Monitoring High-quality Market Relevant Training
    ■■   Improved Quality and Market Relevance of Skills Development Programs
    ■■   Improved Access to and Completion of Skills Training for Female Trainees and Other Disadvantaged Groups
    ■■   Expanding Skills Training through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
    Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is the key implementing agency under the project. National Skill Development Corporation, National Skill Development
    Agency, Sector Skill Councils and State Skill Development Missions are other major stakeholders.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India’s continuing urbanization and high economic growth over the last decade have led to an inevitable rise in ownership and use of motorized vehicles across the country’s cities
     and towns. Two-wheeler (e.g. mopeds, motorcycles) and car ownership in cities has grown by double digits. This growing motorization may be exacerbated by rising incomesAs
     more cars and two-wheelers hit the streets, city centers become congested, road safety deteriorates, and the environment suffers as GHG emissions increase. While the urban
     transport sector accounts for less than 10 percent of India’s total emissions, it is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of fossil fuel consumption. Interventions to develop
     attractive alternatives to personal modes of transport are urgently needed. With support from the Global Environment Fund, the Bank, in partnership with United Nations
     Development Program (UNDP), has been supporting the Ministry of Urban Development since 2006 to develop and implement a Sustainable Urban Transport Program, which
     aims to strengthen national and local government capacity in urban transport planning and management in a more integrated and comprehensive manner. The project supports
     the implementation of the India National Urban Transport Policy.

     The project development objective and global environment objective is to promote environmentally sustainable urban transport in India, including through demonstration
     projects in selected cities. The project has two components:
     ■■   Capacity development assistance for urban transport: Provides technical assistance to the Ministry of Urban Development to improve national, state and local capacity to
          implement the National Urban Transport Policy.
     ■■   City demonstration projects. These demonstration projects focus on: public transport, non-motorized transport, and a pilot Intelligent Transport System (ITS). City pilot projects
          include rapid bus corridors and bicycle lanes.


     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   The Leaders in Urban Transport Planning training program has been successfully running in India with CEPT University; roughly 270 Indian officials have undergone training
          at CEPT and various international locations.
     ■■   Guidance Documents covering seven topics (Unified Metropolitan Transit Authorities, Urban Transport Fund, Transit oriented Development, Non Motorised Transport Master-
          plan, Traffic Management & Information Control Centre, National Urban Transport Helpline, contracting Private Bus Operations) are nearly finalized.
     ■■   Among the City Demonstration projects are an ITS System for Mysore city bus which is beginning to realize significant operational improvements, in Pimpri Chinchwad, the
          two BRTS corridors are in operation (one of which is Bank supported) with strong ridership and positive feedback and an interim bus service is being operated by Naya Raipur
          Development Authority (NRDA) between Raipur and Naya Raipur in advance of launch of the BRT Lite.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    More than 750 million people in India lack access to improved sanitation, with 80 percent of them located in rural India. Only 15 percent of the bottom quintile and 25 per cent
    of the second poorest quintile have access to improved sanitation. Open defecation and poor sanitation practices constitute one of the greatest development challenges facing
    India. In 2014 the Government of India, led by Prime Minister Modi, launched the iconic Swachh Bharat Mission -Gramin (SBM-G), the largest rural sanitation program, which aims
    at behavior change to end open defecation by 2019, targeted symbolically to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth. The SBM-G focuses on changing
    people’s behavior in order to trigger and sustain the usage of toilets, to achieve and sustain open defecation free status in villages and overall cleanliness in villages with improved
    solid and liquid waste management. World Bank Support uses two lending instruments: Program for Results and Investment Project Financing. The Operation leverages the
    other IDA/ IBRD financed rural water and sanitation projects and a Bank-executed Technical Assistance program. The operation provides results-based fiscal transfers to reward
    states for outcomes achieved and for scaling up the implementation of the program across India. The program is setting up an independent third party verification mechanism for
    verification of results through a National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) as well as a citizens’ engagement systems of social audits and grievance redress mechanisms. It
    includes capacity support to different tiers of government – states, districts, sub-districts and rural local bodies, including knowledge sharing among implementing tiers.
    Program Development Objective of the Swachh Bharat Mission Support Operation (SBMSO) is to reduce open defecation in rural areas, and strengthen Ministry of Drinking Water
    and Sanitation capacity to manage the national SBM-G program.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.
    ■■   The project is expected to increase the percentage of the rural population with access to safe and functional sanitation facilities from 30 percent to 60 percent, with special
         focus on women and poor and vulnerable segments of the rural population.
    ■■   It will also reduce open defecation in rural areas and sustain open defecation free status in villages where this has been achieved.
    ■■   It will increase the percentage of the rural population with solid and liquid waste management systems.
    ■■   It will seek to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation on program management, advocacy, behavior change communications, and improved
         monitoring and evaluation system to measure results.

     Total Project Cost
     *US$ millions; as of June 30, 2017


    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Highways Department (HD) of Tamil Nadu is responsible for managing about 62,000 km of the state’s road network, which comprises National Highways (4,974 km, 8
    percent), State Highways (11,594 km, 18 percent), Major District Roads (11,289 km, 19 percent) and Other District Roads & Sugarcane Roads (34,160 km, 55 percent). Over the
    last decade, the Government of Tamil Nadu and its HD has made progress in enhancing the quality of roads, the road network and safety. But it still faces three notable challenges:
    inadequate investments, insufficient implementation capacity and poor road safety. These issues persist because of the rapid economic growth of the state and the consequent
    increase in the number of vehicles and the demand for road transport.

    During the last decade, while the length of the NH, SH and MDR in Tamil Nadu increased by about 50 percent, the number of registered vehicles in the state increased by 160
    percent. According to the state’s Vision 2023 document, the road sector investment requirements over the next 10 years are estimated at INR 900 billion ($15 billion). As against
    these estimates, the annual capital expenditure for the entire sector currently stands at INR 24 billion ($400 million).

    In recent years, a sizeable portion of the capital expenditure is being channeled toward the ‘lower-traffic’ rungs of the network. Such emphasis on capacity expansion of ‘lower’
    rungs of the network contributed to improved road access but it also resulted in underinvestment in capacity expansion of the ‘upper’ rungs of the network with high-traffic. Also,
    most capital expenditures are small-size, traditional item-rate contracts. Using this highly fragmented approach leaves a negligible impact and involves tackling a needy corridor
    through small stretches over several years. Problems include
    ■■   Low implementation capacity: In recent years, the capacity of HD for managing upgradation activity has increased but only up to about 800 km/year whereas to be able to
         achieve the state’s Vision 2023 of upgrading about 20,000 km of roads over the next 10 years, HD would need to more than double its implementation capacity.
    ■■   Road safety: Tamil Nadu currently ranks in the top five states in terms of road accidents, fatalities and injuries, accounting for about 13.8 percent of total accidents and 12
         percent of people killed in road accidents in India. The state’s capacity to respond to the road safety challenge requires substantial augmentation across and through more
         coordinated involvement of multiple stakeholder departments such as transport, police, highways, health and education, not only at the state level but also at lower opera-
         tional levels such as districts and corridors.
    The project development objective is to increase road capacity, enhance the quality of maintenance, improve safety and support institutional development of Tamil Nadu’s Core
    Road Network..

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The expected results are:
    ■■   Upgrading and maintenance of about 575 km of highways through EPC and PPP contracts and long-term performance-based maintenance of another 600 km of highways;
    ■■   A reduced average travel time on project roads; (
    ■■   A reduced average vehicle operating cost on project roads;
    ■■   No increase in number of annual fatalities from road accidents on project roads.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     For India, leveraging urbanization is central to its efforts in alleviating poverty and promoting shared prosperity, as India’s rapid economic growth is accompanied by
     an unprecedented spatial transformation. From amongst the larger states, Tamil Nadu is most urbanized and also has the second largest state economy in India and hence
     urbanization is of particular importance to Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu is a pioneer in many aspects of urban development, there remains a huge unfinished reform and
     investment agenda. The critical importance of urban development for the state is clearly spelt out in the Government of Tamil Nadu’s (GoTN) latest Twelfth Five-Year Plan and its
     Vision 2023 that sets out the vision for the sector as to “promote and facilitate the development of inclusive and sustainable cities”. The Bank has had a long engagement with
     the state government in the urban sector, including through the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) type urban projects that began with the setting up of the Tamil Nadu Urban
     Development Fund (TNUDF) in the late 1990s under TNUDP II, followed by the TNUDP III that closed in 2014. TNUDF has played an important role in fostering urban development
     in the state as well as greater access to financial markets for TN Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), while maintaining an outstanding track record of 100% loan repayments from ULBs over
     the last decade. With the success of TNUDF, GoTN has decided to address the next generation of urban development challenges in the state through TNSUDP. The current TNSUDP
     is also consistent with the Bank Group’s India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2013-2017, and contributes to the development goals set out under Engagement Area 2 of
     the CPS on “Spatial Transformation” by seeking to leverage the rural-urban transformation as an opportunity to reduce poverty and increase competitiveness and supporting India
     and the state of Tamil Nadu in achieving the following Engagement Area 2 outcomes: (i) strengthened institutional capacity of urban governments; (ii) improved urban services;
     and (iii) improved environmental protection.
     The Project Development Objective (PDO) of TNSUDP is to improve urban services in participating ULBs in a financially sustainable manner and to pilot improved urban
     management practices in selected cities. The project comprises three components:
     ■■   Results based grants for urban governance will provide results-based grants to selected eligible ULBs to implement new urban-management models that strengthen gover-
          nance and financial sustainability.
     ■■   Investments in urban services will comprise three sub-components:
          Urban investments sub-component will provide investment support to participating ULBs for improvements in a range of urban services, including water, sewerage,
          municipal solid waste, urban transportation, septage management, and storm water drainage, as well as support project management and supervision. These will be based
          on demand from ULBs in the state, with an emphasis on “sustainability” and improvement of the urban environment.
          Credit enhancement sub-component will create a reserve fund to provide credit enhancement support for municipal bonds and other market-based loan instruments issued
          by ULBs, as well as the Water and Sanitation Pooled Fund (WSPF) of TNUDF. It will seek to further enhance Tamil Nadu’s pioneering efforts in mobilizing resources for urban
          infrastructure from financial markets.
          Project development and TNUDF technical assistance sub-component would provide technical assistance to: (i) ULBs to prepare and implement sub-projects, including
          environmental and social mitigation actions, and PPP arrangements; (ii) ULBs to implement credit enhancement measures; (iii) CoC, for urban flood risk mitigation; and (iv)
          TNUDF, for institutional development.
     ■■   Urban sector technical assistance is aimed at strengthening the state’s capacity to carry out urban finance and municipal governance reforms in: (i) developing next genera-
          tion municipal e-governance and GIS systems for ULBs; (ii) institutional development and capacity building, including training, sector studies, operations and maintenance,
          and strengthening public financial management at ULBs; and (iii) project management.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.
     ■■   At least 2 million urban residents receive improved urban services as result of interventions under the project.
     ■■   Out of such beneficiaries of improved urban services, at least 40 percent are female.
     ■■   Additional financial resources mobilized by ULBs for urban infrastructure through non-budgetary sources to the extent of $80 million equivalent.
     ■■   Aggregate increase in Own Source Revenues (OSR) of “Model Cities” under urban governance component of over $12 million equivalent through implementation of OSR
          improvement plans.
     ■■   Over 90 participating ULBs with new municipal e-governance systems for improved citizen interface and transparency.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    TEQIP III is the third phase of an envisioned 15-year phased program initiated with the first phase of TEQIP from 2002 to 2009. The project builds on the significant results achieved
    in the two phases of the project which supported over 250 engineering institutes and thousands of faculty members from institutes such as NIT Rourkela, College of Engineering
    Pune, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad, and BIT Mesra. It has made a considerable impact on the quality of education by implementing institutional and
    policy reforms focusing on institutional autonomy and accountability.

    TEQIP’s third phase will respond to the need to make distribution of skills among labor market entrants more equitable across different parts of the country by focusing on states
    with under-performing engineering education systems. Nearly 50 percent of the population lives in India’s low income states, hill states, and states of the north east with poverty
    rates close to 48 percent. In these states, 16.8 percent of those in higher education study engineering courses, against 28.4 percent in other states and access to engineering
    courses is particularly poor for students from poorer households. Specific groups such as students from scheduled castes and tribes and female students have lower transition
    rates from the first year to the second year, relative to other students, leading to higher dropout rates. TEQIP III’s project development objective is ‘to enhance quality and equity in
    participating engineering education institutes and improve the efficiency of the engineering education system in focus states . The Project will support two main types of activities:
    ■■   Improving Quality and Equity in Engineering Institutes in Focus States: This will include support to government engineering institutes in focus states as well as Affiliating
         Technical Universities in those states. A select number of high-performing institutes from TEQIP I and II in other states will also be funded, with the primary objective of
         building twinning relationships between these institutes and those in focus states
    ■■   System-level Initiatives to Strengthen Sector Governance and Performance: This component will support activities to strengthen institutes such as the All India Council for
         Technical Education and National Board of Accreditation. It will also finance rigorous studies and evaluations, including student assessment and stakeholder satisfaction
         surveys.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.
    ■■   An increase in average score of students participating in tests designed to measure technical and critical thinking skills.
    ■■   An increase in percentage of programs that have applied for or received NBA accreditation from 50% to 70%.
    ■■   An increase in percentage of students from traditionally disadvantaged groups (disaggregated by SC/ST, gender) in total enrolment in participating institutes from 15% to
         20% (SC-ST) and 26% to 30% (women).
    ■■   An increase in percentage of participating institutes with UGC autonomy from focus states from 42.5% to 65%.
    ■■   An increase in Transition rate of UG engineering students from the first year to the second year in participating institutes from 50% to 60% (for SC/ST: 40% to 50%; for women:
         45% to 55%).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India is one of the world’s largest and most dynamic emerging markets with vast economic potential. However, economic growth has decreased from over 10 percent in 2010 to 7
     percent in 2016, with estimates for recent quarters indicating further retardation. The manufacturing sector is essential for the Government of India’s drive to attain a growth rate
     of 8 percent. For example, the Government of India’s National Manufacturing Policy set the objective of “enhancing the share of manufacturing in GDP from its current level of 15
     to 25 percent within a decade and creating 100 million additional jobs.”

     This program’s development objective is to enhance the productivity of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by improving their access to technology and business
     advisory services, as well as skilled workers through systems of financially sustainable Technology Centers (TCs). The project is composed of three components:
     ■■   Technical assistance to the existing and new TCs with respect to their technological and business needs under the guidance of Industry Specific Joint Working Groups com-
          prising main industry leaders and representatives.
     ■■   Investments to upgrade the 18 existing TCs (currently called Tool Rooms and Technology Development Centers) and develop 15 new TCs spanning 25 states, including at
          least eight in low-income states.
     ■■   Technical assistance to the MSME Ministry for project implementation support as well as monitoring and evaluation.
     The Government of India requested a restructuring of the IBRD Loan in July 2017, and a restructuring mission is scheduled in September 2017. The restructuring will be completed
     in FY18Q2.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Increase in the number of paid services rendered by TCs to enterprises including placement services from a baseline of 23,000 to an end target of 60,000.
     ■■   Increase in the number of long-term trainees employed in industry within six months of graduating from the TCs from 8,000 to 26,000 by 2020.
     ■■   Increase in the TCs’ net profit before depreciation (not including land) from $3.5 million in 2012 to $12 million by 2020.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Created in 2000, Jharkhand is a low-income Indian state with a 39.1% poverty headcount and gross state domestic product of (GSDP) of US$589 (2010-11). With a population
    of 33 million, 76% is rural. The share of vulnerable groups is high with 12% belonging to a Scheduled Caste and 26% to a Scheduled Tribe. The population is also very young;
    adolescents and youth (ages 10-24) constitute 31% of the total population. Adolescent girls and young women are a particularly vulnerable group, as well as a source of vast under-
    realized potential for contributing to Jharkhand’s competiveness. In educational and economic opportunities, young women and adolescent girls are clearly lagging. A 2015 World
    Bank household survey found that 62% of young women (ages 16-24) were not in training, education, or employment, compared to 14% of young men in the same households.
    Only 16% of married girls ages 18-24 are employed (and only 1% are in regular wage employment), and only 31% of young women ages 18-24 achieved at least class 10.

    The project development objective is to improve completion of market-driven skills training and secondary education for adolescent girls and young women in select districts of
    Jharkhand. The project has three components:
    ■■   Expanding social, educational, and economic opportunities: supporting adolescent girls and young women in Jharkhand to achieve greater social, educational and
         economic empowerment by financing two major interventions at the community and institutional levels. This will be achieved by financing formation and capacity building
         of community-level young women’s groups, life skills education, community-level business skills training, community mobilization and communications, vocational skills
         training and non-formal education for a subset of project beneficiaries, and cash transfers ($150 per beneficiary) to about 15% of the total beneficiaries.
    ■■   Intensive service delivery: piloting and evaluating more intensive community-level service delivery models focused on increasing young women’s access to educational
         interventions, training, and employment opportunities. This will be achieved by financing a local full-time designated safe space (“cluster center”), and interventions for
         enhanced outreach to hard-to-reach populations.
    ■■   State capacity building and implementation support: strengthening of institutional capacity and outreach of the department of women & child development and social
         security and the Jharkhand women development society to ensure effective and efficient delivery of services for adolescent girls and young women in the state.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■   200,000 project beneficiaries (ages 16–24) will complete market-driven skills training,
    ■■   50000 project beneficiaries (ages 14–20) will receive a secondary education certificate through bridge education or Non Formal Education (NFE),
    ■■   40% of the project beneficiaries will complete market-driven skills training or education (through mainstreaming or NFE) and are in paid employment or continued education
         six months after completion.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Telangana is a middle-income state, and has experienced significant economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years. However, prosperity is unevenly distributed: the
     poverty ratio among the Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, and Muslims is quite high when compared to the rest of the population. There is an income deficit since the small
     and marginal farmers, especially SC and ST households, have not adequately benefitted from growth in agriculture. There is also the human development deficit, as most health
     and nutrition indicators are worse for SCs and STs. They need to be addressed jointly to ensure shared prosperity and a greater pace of poverty reduction. The project will work
     concurrently on economic development, human development, and social protection with a focus on ICT. The project development objective is to enable selected poor households
     to enhance agricultural incomes and secure increased access to human development services and social entitlements. The project has five components:
     ■■   Value chain development: The objective of this component is to increase the income of small and marginal farmers through productivity enhancement and improved market
          access. This component will also invigorate local markets.
     ■■   Human development: To enable the community to hold the service providers accountable for service delivery in the HD sector, and improve HD service delivery by strength-
          ening the existing public systems. It will target health, nutrition, sanitation, and education.
     ■■   Digital local government: This component aims to improve the coverage and service delivery of social protection entitlements to the poorest households, complementing the

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous state with an estimated population of nearly 200 million, or 17 percent of the population of India. Seventy-seven percent of the population
    lives in rural areas, and about 33 percent live below the poverty line. Uttar Pradesh has been ranked in the bottom third of Indian states on the Human Poverty Index since 1981,
    and the state lags behind all other states of the country on most human development indicators.

    Given the size of the state population and the disproportionately higher mortality and morbidity rates, Uttar Pradesh will determine whether India as a whole achieves its health
    goals and its health-related MDGs. Public health spending has been steadily increasing and is no longer the main constraint. Despite increasing government, donor, and private
    investments in the health sector in Uttar Pradesh, the main challenge is centered on inadequate organizational performance. The Bank-financed project is expected to leverage its
    resources to help the Government of Uttar Pradesh improve the efficiency of the health system and enhance the effectiveness of public investment in the health sector.

    The development objective of the Uttar Pradesh Health Systems Strengthening Project is to improve the efficiency, quality, and accountability of health services delivery in the state
    by strengthening the state Health Department’s management and systems capacity. The project’s two components are:
    ■■   Strengthening the Department of Health’s management and accountability systems: Supports: (i) strengthening strategic planning functions; (ii) improving use of data for
         program management; (iii) strengthening the use of financial information for improved decision making, and strengthening of procurement and supply chain management
         systems; and (iv) introducing and strengthening social accountability mechanisms and introducing provider incentives in the public sector, and evaluating their impact.
    ■■   Improving the Department of Health’s capacity to perform its quality assurance role and more effectively engage the private sector: Supports: (i) strengthening the institution-
         al capacity for service-quality improvement and regulatory capacity by establishing Quality Assurance, Environment Management, and PPP cells in the Directorate of Health;
         (ii) hospital accreditation under the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals; (iii) contracting with the private sector for delivery of diagnostic services and non-clinical
         support services; and (iv) strengthening human resources management and availability.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    The project is supporting improvements toward quality accreditation in 40 hospitals. Of these, 28 are now monitoring and producing annual data on service productivity, efficiency,
    quality; and 8 have been certified for entry level pre-accreditation.
    ■■   All districts are using an electronic system for paying salaries of health workers (against a target of 75 percent).
    ■■   Social accountability interventions are being piloted in 12 districts. 63 percent of the Gram Panchayats participating in the pilot have completed a service delivery assessment
         and at least 1 issue raised by the Village Health, Nutrition and Sanitation Committee has been corrected by the government and verified by the community.
    ■■   50 district hospitals are using performance based contracts to improve the quality of service delivery, including by outsourcing cleaning and gardening as well as high end
         pathology services to private providers.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Background:

     Nearly 80% of the population in UP lives in the rural areas and about two-thirds (66%) of them are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. A number of structural and
     institutional constrain the performance of agriculture sector in UP including:
     ■■   Low productivity: Land productivity varies widely between the major agro-ecological zones in UP, and on average the yield gap is about 45% for rice, 50% for wheat, and 30%
          in maize. The main causes of low productivity are sodicity, water-logging, lack of assured irrigation, imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers, unavailability of organic manure,
          and poor agronomic practices;
     ■■   Land degradation: About 51,400,000 ha of agricultural land in UP (nearly one-sixth of cultivable land) is facing a variety of land degradation problems, including sodic lands,
          ravines lands, alkali soils, and water logging;
     ■■   Weak dissemination of agricultural technology: The root cause appears to be poor capacity in the Agriculture Department, which is the main extension agency, especially
          regarding preparing grassroots extension workers so that they could support farmers in applying both new and existing production methods; and
     ■■   Small land holdings: The poor not only occupy degraded lands but also suffer from small land holdings. UP has the highest percentage of marginal farmers in the country
          with about 76.9% of farmers owning less than 1 ha of land.
     The project aims to sustainably reclaim 130,000 ha of predominantly barren and low productivity sodic lands, which would improve household food security through increased
     productivity and cropping intensity. By focusing on degraded lands cultivated by the poorer section of farmers, the project will contribute to sustainable alleviation of poverty
     because the productive capacity of land will be raised significantly with little risk of re-sodification. This is extremely important given that UP agriculture suffers from very high
     productivity gaps of more than 50% in key crops such as rice and wheat. In addition to physical land reclamation and on-farm development, the project will provide a variety
     of support to the farmer groups, both in input delivery and output marketing. This will include support services in farmer extension, better water management practices, use of
     improved inputs (seeds and fertilizers) and enhanced market access.
     Objectives:

     The project development objective (PDO) is to increase agricultural productivity of degraded lands in selected areas of UP. The objective would be achieved by reversing water-
     induced land degradation, enhancing soil fertility, and improving the provision of agriculture support services

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     ■■   Reclaim a total 130,000 ha of sodic lands and 11,520 ha of ravine lands;
     ■■   Increase cropping intensities on previously heavy sodisized/abandoned lands from 25% to 206%;
     ■■   Provide assured irrigation facilities for around 61,000 ha of land;
     ■■   Improve drainage systems for 46,000 ha of sodic lands and 572,000 ha of non-sodic lands;
     ■■   Achieve average yields of paddy and wheat 3.6 t/ha and 3.2 t/ha respectively;
     ■■   Increase average income of participating farmers by 75%

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    With a population of approximately 200 million, Uttar Pradesh lags behind most Indian states across a number of human development indicators. Currently, over 50 million
    people live below the poverty line with a large majority living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for about 30 percent of the state GDP and 60 percent of the total employment.
    Rural people are especially dependent on agriculture as a source of labor and livelihoods. The project aims to help build the institutional capacity of water-related institutions—
    institutions needed to increase agricultural productivity in this low-income state where agriculture will continue to play an important role in alleviating poverty. Under the
    Phase 1 operation, irrigation and drainage systems covering about 3 percent of the irrigated area (343,000 hectares) were rehabilitated and modernized in the pilot Jaunpur
    Branch basin using modern surveys and designs. More than 800 WUAs were established and strengthened following the passing of the seminal Uttar Pradesh Participatory
    Irrigation Management Act (2009). Other achievements include a state-level water resource agency and introduction of a management information system for the state Irrigation
    Department. Phase 2 will rehabilitate and modernize critical irrigation and drainage infrastructure in identified areas, consolidate and deepen various institutional reforms
    established under Phase 1, and refocus on water-saving agricultural activities through farmer water schools and joint activities between the Irrigation and Agriculture departments.
    The Project development objective is to:
    ■■   Strengthen the institutional and policy framework for integrated water resources management for the entire state
    ■■   Increase agricultural productivity and water productivity by supporting farmers in targeted irrigation areas.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■   Haidergarh Branch - Sarda Sahayak System work of Rehabilitation is nearing completion (90% completed); PLGC Lining works - total length of lining work has advanced with
         32% completion as on date and expected completion in 2018.
    ■■   Appointment of a Chairman and Members of the Water Management and Regulatory Commission (WAMREC) was re-advertised and are in the final stages of selection
         process.
    ■■   Consultancy activities have advanced on river basin assessments, flood forecasting set up for Rapti river basin within UPID along with other participating departments such as
         groundwater has installed first lot of 200 Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLR); and agriculture has been able to establish 240 Farmers Water Schools (FWS). Master Trainers

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    In June 2013 the monsoon arrived almost two weeks earlier than expected in the state of Uttarakhand, located in northern Himalayan region of India. From June 15 to 17, 2013,
    an extreme amount of precipitation (124.5 – 244.4 mm) hit several parts of the higher reaches of the Himalayas. This unprecedented rainfall resulted in a sudden increase in water
    levels, giving rise to flash floods in the Mandakini, Alakananda, Bhagirathi and other river basins, while also causing extensive landslides at various locations. According to official
    sources, over 900,000 people have been affected by the event. This region is one of the most important pilgrimage circuits in India. Since the disaster coincided with the peak
    tourist and pilgrimage season, it significantly increased the number of casualties, missing, and affected population. More than 4,000 lives were lost, 4,200 villages were affected,
    about 3,320 houses and 995 public buildings were damaged, and close to 9,000 km of roads were affected.

    Uttarakhand is also in a zone highly prone to natural disasters. The entire state falls within Zone IV and V (V represents the highest level of seismicity) of the Earthquake Zoning Map
    of India. In the recent past, the state has witnessed two major earthquakes (Uttarkashi 1991 and Chamoli 1999). Every year, the state faces losses, particularly during the monsoon,
    due to rains, cloudbursts, landslides, floods, hailstorms, and waterlogging events. The Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project supports the Government of Uttarakhand for risk and
    vulnerability reduction, with assistance for reconstructing damaged infrastructure, restoring connectivity, and improving technical support for managing future disaster risks. The
    project aims to restore housing, rural connectivity and build resilience of communities in Uttarakhand and increase the technical capacity of state entities to respond promptly and
    effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project has the following components:
    ■■   Resilient infrastructure reconstruction focusing on the immediate reconstruction of damaged housing and restoration of public buildings essential for public services using
         resilient construction standards under an owner-driven reconstruction modality.
    ■■   Rural road connectivity focusing on providing access to markets as well as health and education services through the reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges with
         upgraded designs to withstand earthquake and flood forces, including improved drainage and slope stabilization.
    ■■   Technical assistance and capacity building for disaster risk management to enhance the capabilities of government entities in risk mitigation and response, including: risk
         modeling and assessment; establishing a decision support system; strengthening early warning systems and response capacity; and to finance relevant studies to better
         understand and manage natural disaster risks.
    ■■   Financing disaster response expenses for eligible expenses already incurred during the post-disaster response period.
    ■■   Implementation support for the incremental operating costs of the project, including as well the creation of small, temporary field implementation offices, training, exposure
         visits, and knowledge exchange programs.
    ■■   Contingency emergency response, which can be triggered, at the request of the government, following an adverse natural event that causes a major natural disaster to
         re-allocate unallocated project funds to support response and reconstruction.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED:
    ■■   2,382 Owner Driven Construction of Houses (ODCH) have been completed including insurance provided for 10 years.
    ■■   26 Public building are planned to be constructed comprising of primary schools, police station, fire stations, public health centers and technical institutions. Construction has

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Hills account for over 90 percent of Uttarakhand’s area and forests cover two-thirds, which makes inaccessibility a very crucial and cross-cutting issue. Uttarakhand faces persisting
     challenges in improving maternal and child health (IMR-33/1000 lives births, NMR-29/1000 live births and MMR-162/100,000 live births) and at the same time the state is
     facing a growing burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Uttarakhand’s health system faces severe human resources constraints, contributing to limited access, inequity,
     and the highly variable quality of health services. At the same time, private sector plays an important role in the provision of services, accounting for 82 percent and 65 percent
     of outpatient care and for 57 percent and 66 percent of inpatient care for rural and urban areas respectively. Uttarakhand also needs to address the financial burden in accessing
     health care and the risk of catastrophic health expenditures.

     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve access to quality health services, particularly in the hilly districts of the state, and to expand health financial risk protection
     for the residents of Uttarakhand.

     Components include:
     ■■      Innovations in Engaging the Private Sector in the delivery of health care services, as well as in health care financing. This component will expand access to services by creating
             integrated, technology-enabled health system architecture with enhanced focus and availability of primary care, emergency care, and necessary referral services.
     ■■      Stewardship and System Improvement – this component will strengthen the Government’s capacity to engage effectively with the private sector, and therefore, enable the
             Government to provide effective stewardship to improve the quality of services.

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED:
     ■■      Increase in number of annual out-patient visits to primary health centers (PHCs), CHCs and mobile vans from current baseline of 800,000 to 1.15 million
     ■■      Increase in number of government and non-government healthcare facilities in the state issued with an entry (or higher) level certification by the National Accreditation Board
             for Hospitals – from 2 to 8 over the project period
     ■■      Increase in number of hospital admissions and outpatient consultations covered by any form of health insurance supported by the project – from 46,040 to 100,000 over
             the project period

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    India is currently the world’s third largest consumer of electricity, however, average per capita consumption of electricity is only one third of the global average – slightly lower than
    the average for the African continent . India has the largest energy access deficit of any single country. Almost 300 million people remain without access to electricity. Furthermore,
    India’s power sector also relies heavily on fossil fuels (primarily coal) - the country is currently the world’s fourth largest Green House Gas (GHG) emitter, and coal consumption is
    poised to almost treble by 2030. To address these issues, the Government of India (GOI) plans to: (i) expand generation by using renewable energy sources whenever feasible and
    strengthen the central transmission network to facilitate energy exchange across regions; (ii) improve energy efficiency and performance of institutions in the power sector; and
    (iii) expand access for rural and peri-urban populations.
    The Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydroelectric Power Project (VPHEP) is an important part of the Government’s clean energy plans. The Project is also a key part of the World Bank‘s
    commitment to helping improve the performance and sustainability of the hydropower sector in India, which is critical to the greening of the power sector, and sustaining the
    country’s economic growth.

    The VPHEP is a proposed 444 Megawatt (MW) run-of-the-river hydro generation project on the Alaknanda River, which is a tributary of the Ganges River. VPHEP is an environmental
    category ‘A’ project, implemented by a public sector company Teri Hydro Development Corporations (THDC)), majority-owned by the GOI, which was set up in 1988 to develop
    baseload hydropower potential in Northern India, and which is now expanding its operations by developing primarily run-of-river projects. Building on lessons learned in India
    and in other countries, the project will help create effective project execution for cascaded hydropower systems and foster a coordinated approach to river basin planning and
    development. VPHEP will also help increase generating capacity to complement the government of India’s efforts to improve the performance of the country’s distribution and
    transmission networks. In line with the Ministry of Power’s desire to develop public-sector hydro companies into top-performing public companies in the power sector, the Project
    also supports THDC to strengthen its capacity and systems to become a leading hydropower company.

    The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) increase the supply of electricity to India’s national grid through the addition of renewable, low-carbon energy; and (ii) strengthen
    the institutional capacity of THDC with respect to the preparation and implementation of economically, environmentally and socially sustainable hydropower projects. The project
    has two components:
    ■■   Construction of the 444 MW VPHEP in Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India, and
    ■■   Support to capacity building and institutional strengthening at THDC India Limited, the project developer.

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■   Addition off the 444 MW of low-carbon energy generation.
    ■■   Improves institutional capacity in THDC India Limited, a public power company
    ■■   After an initial delay of almost 2 years in the award of the Civil Works contract, and a further 12 months due to significant flooding in 2013, major EPC (Engineering, Procure-
         ment & Construction) contracts were finalized in 2014

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India is a fast growing economy with a rising demand for skilled workers. A skilled workforce enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the labor market, reduces skills bottlenecks,
     and enhances mobility and productivity. One of the key suppliers of such workers is the vocational education and training (VET) system. A major component of the VET system is the
     Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS), run under the auspices of the Ministry of Labor and Employment and the National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT) at the national level,
     and the state departments dealing with vocational training and the State Council for Vocational Training at the state level. However, graduates from the CTS system face low labor
     market outcomes; the 2006 Baseline Tracer Study conducted by the World Bank shows that less than 30 percent of graduates from industrial training institutes find employment
     upon graduation. The Indian government sought World Bank assistance to introduce key reforms at the system and institution levels.
     The project development objective is to improve the employment outcomes of graduates from the vocational training system, by making the design and delivery of training more
     responsive top demands. It has three components:
     ■■ Improving quality of vocational training, which focuses on: (i) improving quality and relevance of training provided in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) selected compet-
          itively from eligible states/union territories; (ii) upgrading training of ITI instructors; and (iii) providing incentive funds to states to reward good performance in project
          implementation.
     ■■ Promoting systemic reforms and innovations focuses on activities that enhance the overall reach and effectiveness of the vocational training system in the medium-term.
          Implementation of activities under this component is the responsibility of the Directorate General of Training, discharged in collaboration with states, industry associations,
          and private training providers, as necessary.
     ■■ Project management, monitoring and evaluation support.

     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
     ■■    80 percent of the graduates from project ITIs already exit from the CTS system with a NCVT certificate, compared to the baseline of 61 percent and an end-of-project target of
           73 percent.
     ■■    60 percent of project ITI graduates find employment within one year of finishing training, compared to the baseline 32 percent and an end-of-project target of 50 percent.
           38 percent of female graduates find employment within a year of finishing training compared to the baseline of 18.7 percent.
     ■■    Real monthly earnings of employed graduates from project ITI, measured one year after completing training, rose from a baseline of Rs. 2,421 to Rs3,553, as compared with
           the end-of-project target of Rs 3,026.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Water resources development is a priority for the Government of India. Development of irrigation infrastructure is necessary to reduce climatic risks, and irrigated agricultural
    development is central to the government’s strategy for ensuring food security. The average agriculture productivity levels are still relatively low in West Bengal. There is big
    potential for enhancing agriculture productivity, given sufficient irrigation. Despite having abundant surface and groundwater resources, 40 percent of the state’s cultivated area is
    rain-fed, and the cropping intensity has stagnated over the last decade. The majority of the rain-fed area belongs to small and marginal farmers, and the state provides them with
    minor irrigation schemes, including lift irrigation, deep and shallow tube wells, pump-dug wells, tanks, and small water harvesting structures. Once implemented, these schemes
    are operated and maintained by the community. Performance of these minor irrigation schemes has been mixed, mainly due to the absence of strong ownership among users.
    The Bank-supported West Bengal Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation Project aims to contribute to improved reliability of water resources for irrigation and increased
    agricultural productivity by empowering communities. The total area to be developed is 139,000 hectares, benefiting an estimated 166,000 farm families.

    The project development objective is to enhance agricultural production of small and marginal farmers by developing minor irrigation schemes, strengthening community-based
    irrigation management, and supporting agricultural development, including provision of agricultural services, encouraging crop diversification and use of new technologies, and
    creating income-generating opportunities. The project’s main components are:
    ■■   Strengthening community-based institutions by establishing water users’ associations (WUA) and other farmers’ organizations to assume responsibilities for management,
         operation, and maintenance of minor irrigation schemes and improved irrigated agricultural practices.
    ■■   Irrigation system development by supporting construction of 2,400 new minor surface water irrigation schemes and 2,260 new minor ground water irrigation schemes.
    ■■   Agriculture support services by providing agricultural support services in the project area to enhance productivity and diversification in agriculture

    KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■   The project’s main contribution is in the area of modernized planning and monitoring, improved water resources development and management practices, and creation of
         sustainable institutions to efficiently operate and maintain irrigation structures.
    ■■   The project, in its fourth year of implementation, is in the process of providing 800 irrigation schemes with 50% already handed over to users. These schemes have a potential
         to serve 10,000 ha and benefit more than 33,000 users.
    ■■   The crop production and gross income of farmers in rainfed zones have improved three fold and equipped them to be ready for drought with improved water availability. The
         project is expected to result in a more than 40 percent increase in production of main agricultural crops (rice, oilseeds, and vegetables), 1800 new operational WUAs with 15
         percent female beneficiaries, and more than 60 percent of marginal and poor farmers strengthened to generate resources for management, operation, and maintenance of
         the schemes.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     West Bengal has been on the forefront of the decentralization process in India for the last few decades; it was first State to hold democratic elections and to devolve to the local
     governments (PRIs) all the functions listed on the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. The consolidation of the PRI system in West Bengal was supported by the World Bank-
     financed Institutional Strengthening of Gram Panchayats Project (ISGPP-I) that focused on strengthening the 1,000 (out of 3,342) better performing Local Governments through
     the provision of more resources, capacities and incentives to improve service delivery and governance. Aggregate funding flows to the PRIs have increased by 50% between
     2010 and 2015 and it is estimated that untied funds allocated to the Gram Panchayats (GPs) will more than double between 2015 and 2020. To enable GPs to make full use of
     the significant increase in funding and enhanced autonomy given to them, ISGPP-II now cover all 3,342 GPs in the State and focusses on strengthen the public administration,
     financial management, planning and accountability systems at the GP level. The Program Development Objective of ISGPP-II is to strengthen the institutional and financial
     capacities of Gram Panchayats (GPs) across West Bengal. The PDO level indicators are: (i) Percentage of GPs that meet the mandatory conditions; and (ii) Average percentage of
     total performance-based grants utilized by the GPs. The Program finances 10 activities through 7 disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED OR ACHIEVED:
     The annual targets of the 7 DLIs for the first year of the program have been fully met as follows:
     ■■      1,119 GPs have qualified the Basic Mandatory Conditions in Annual Performance Assessment
     ■■      888 GPs have qualified the Expanded Mandatory Conditions in Annual Performance Assessment
     ■■      An annual learning and training plan has been developed
     ■■      An annual mentor deployment plan has been developed
     ■■      The core modules of a web-based Gram Panchayat Management System (GPMS) are in use in 2,506 GPs, and the online Grievance Redressal Management System (GRMS)
             is functional
     ■■      The first Annual Performance Assessments has been successfully conducted
     ■■      A Human Resources plan and budget to fill the vacancies in the GPs has been completed
