About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        as a VAT taxpayer from the moment of a such request. VAT taxpayer number

This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

  3   Request and obtain terms of construction from Tbilisi Architecture at                     5 days               no charge
      the Tbilisi Hall
      Agency : Tbilisi Architecture at the Tbilisi Hall

      The applicant requests terms of construction from the Tbilisi City Hall, which
      acts as preliminary permission to build on the land plot and to design the
      project. Within 5 days of when the application is submitted Tbilisi Hall
      provides general instructions of what type of building the applicant may
      construct, how much of the land the project may occupy on the land plot,
      and how the landscape is to be utilized. This information is needed in order
      to complete the architectural design of the project.

  4   Request and obtain design approval from Tbilisi Architecture at the                       15 days              no charge
      Tbilisi Hall
      Agency : Tbilisi Architecture at the Tbilisi Hall

      Once the architectural design is complete, based on the terms of
      construction provided, the applicant submits a request for approval to the
      Tbilisi Architecture at Tbilisi Hall. City Hall then has 15 days to grant its
      approval. When this approval is obtained, BuildCo may submit all the
      documents to obtain a building permit.

  5   Request and obtain building permit from Tbilisi Architecture                              10 days              GEL 650
      Agency : Tbilisi Architecture

      The cost is determined by the project value. According to Tbilisi Government
      Resolution No 2-21, as of February 28, 2008, the fee has been increased to
      GEL 1.00 per sq. m. and only the ground oor space is counted. Thus, the
      breakdown in the case considered here is 1300.6/2 x GEL 1.00 = GEL 650.30.


      According to GOG Resolution No. 57 as of March 24 2009, construction
      projects are classi ed into risk-based categories. Depending on the
      complexity of each category, di erent types of procedures are to be followed
      by applicants. The rst category is the lowest risk, and the fth is the most
      complex one. The Doing Business case study warehouse falls under category
      III, which does not require project expertise and entails a simpli ed process
      of approval that also excludes the need for approval of Architectural-
      Construction Design.

       Having obtained the conditions from the water authority, BuildCo starts
       building the water and sewage pipes to the main water pipeline. Once there
       is a connection to the main pipeline, the inspector from private water
       company (Georgian Water and Power) comes to con rm the connection and
       sign the protocol.

  10   Request and obtain exploitation of building construction from Tbilisi            15 days                 no charge

       After the completion of construction and prior to registration at the Public
       Registry, BuildCo submits a request to the Department of Supervision of
       Tbilisi for a decision on completion/occupancy permission. The list of
       documents required for the submission are approved by the Resolution of
       Government of Georgia № 57 on March 24, 2009 "On the Procedures and
       Conditions of Issuance of Construction Permits", Article 96, Paragraph 3.

       The company must submit the document obtained in the previous
       procedure and the exploitation permit. The time line is faster under the
       Georgian Law on Registration of Rights on Immovable Property (December
       28, 2005).

       discussed. After the inspection, the 50% of the connection fee has to be paid
       if it has been suggested that the connection is to be 380/220 V. After the
       inspection technical conditions related to the external connection only and a
       project design which outlines in detail speci cations of the connection are
       issued and the connection contract is signed.
       The Technical conditions generally include instructions for construction of a
       new substation; lining of high-voltage and low-voltage cables; in a case of
       reconstruction works - participation of the customer in the required works.

If the duration and frequency of outages is not available, or is over 100, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.

If the minimum outage time considered for SAIDI/SAIFI is over 5 minutes, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.




    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      It is also possible to submit the transaction at one of the 500 authorized
      users. These can be banks, notaries or real estate companies. These entities
      can verify the transaction and submit the purchase and sale agreement to
      the National Public Registry. The employees dealing with these transactions
      receive a training provided by the National Public Registry and a
      memorandum is signed between the National Public Registry and the entity.

       The authorized entity receiving the application will verify the identity of the
       buyer and seller, as well as the ownership of the property. Once the
       information is submitted though a speci c software, the National public
       registry employee will verify again the ownership and the existence of the
       individuals (in the Civil registry database that they can access electronically)
       and process the transfer. Another software is used at this stage.



       Georgian legislation provides for the possibility of accelerated proceedings,
       therefore if the buyer wishes to register property transfer on the same day
       of submission of all necessary documents, the fee is respectively GEL 200. If
       registration is carried out on the day following the day of submission, the fee
       totals to GEL 150. GEL 50 is a fee paid for ordinary registration procedures,
       which take 4 business days following the submission of all required
       documents to the Public Registry. The payment is done at any commercial
       bank.



       There is also an option available to apply for an extract electronically via the
       Georgian National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) website with fees being
       as follows: 1 working day - 10 GEL and at the day of application - 40 GEL.



       The 2% immovable property transfer tax has been abolished. A new Tax
       Code speci es “Income Tax” for physical persons and “Pro t Tax” for legal
       entities in case of property sale, only if sale of property takes place within 2
       years after its purchase and equals to 20% (for physical persons) and 15%
       (for legal entities) of the di erence between purchase and sale price. These
       are capital gains taxes. If the sale of property takes place after 2 years since
       its purchase, physical persons are exempted from paying "Income Tax".

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating
                                                         charge or any charge that gives BizBank a security interest over ABC’s

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer            Explanation

Proceeding           liquidation      BizBank is most likely to initiate liquidation proceedings, because it would want to sell the
                                      assets as soon as possible. As a secured creditor, BizBank can prevent the use of
                                      reorganization procedure. It also holds 74% of the debt, which would allow it to select a
                                      representative to the Conciliation Council - a body that decides whether liquidation or
                                      reorganization should be pursued.

Outcome              piecemeal sale   Hotel's assets will be sold at a public auction. At the first auction, the assets must be sold as
                                      a whole. If they are not sold at the first auction, the creditors may authorize a piecemeal sale
                                      during the second auction and the price will be decreased (Article 38 of the Law on
                                      Insolvency Proceedings). It is likely to be difficult to find a buyer for the hotel as a going
                                      concern, therefore, the most likely outcome is a piecemeal sale.

Time (in years)      2.0              It takes 2 years to complete liquidation proceedings in Georgia, because statutory deadlines
                                      are not always complied with. In particular, it may take a year for the first meeting of the
                                      creditors to take place. As a first step, BizBank will commence liquidation proceedings with
                                      the Tbilisi City Court. The court will review the materials and accept the case for
                                      consideration. Once the case is accepted, the National Enforcement Bureau will be
                                      appointed as a trustee/supervisor (Article 26 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings) and the
                                      date for the first meeting of the creditors is set (Article 21 of the Law on Insolvency
                                      Proceedings). The trustee will inform the creditors about the opening of the insolvency
                                      proceedings by publication, will assume control over the management of the debtor
                                      company, examine its financials and prepare a report on the insolvency of the debtor (Article
                                      26 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings). Creditors submit their claims, and then present
                                      them at the first meeting of the creditors. The judge makes a decision whether to accept or
                                      reject the claim after consulting with the trustee (Article 29 of the Law on Insolvency
                                      Proceedings). Conciliation Council will be appointed (the debtor and the creditors will each
                                      appoint one member and the two will elect the third member) (Article 32 of the Law on
                                      Insolvency Proceedings). The Conciliation Council will decide whether to proceed with
                                      liquidation or with reorganization (Article 33 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings). Once the
                                      decision to liquidate the debtor is made, the creditors will appoint a liquidation manager
                                      (Article 37 of the Law on Insolvency Proceedings). Debtor's assets will be sold at an auction
                                      organized by the National Enforcement Bureau.

Cost (% of           10.0             Around 7% of the value of the estate will be paid to the National Bureau of Enforcement for

                                      National Bureau of Enforcement acting as an auctioneer (Article 9 of the Order No 144 of the
                                      Minister of Justice, dated July 30, 2010). Other expenses will include attorneys' fees, which
                                      may vary between 1 and 4%.
