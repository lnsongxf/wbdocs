About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Since September, 2009, it is possible to reserve the proposed company
        name in advance of submitting the incorporation papers. The advantage of

        inappropriate for some other reason (such as public policy). There is a fee

        registered with the O ce. However, the use of the model company
        incorporation documents, using the CRO disk system, will result in a reduced

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      Agency : Planning Department - Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council

      The application for planning permission includes a layout or site plan, a sign
      notice, drawings of oor plans, elevations and sections, a copy of the
      newspaper notice and a copy of the site notice erected 15 days prior to
      submission of all documents. 10 copies of drawings, statements, photos,
      etc., are required as all prescribed bodies must receive a copy under the
      regulations

      The full application fee prescribed under the Irish Planning and Development
      Regulations must accompany the application for planning permission, as the
      application may otherwise be deemed invalid and returned by the planning
      authority.

      Site Notice
      A copy of the site notice must be submitted with each planning application.
      The site notice must be placed on site for ve weeks from the date of receipt
      of the planning application. If it becomes illegible or is removed, it must be
      replaced immediately as failure to do so will invalidate the application. The
      site notice must be located at the entrance to the private road where it
      meets the public road, and at the entrance to the site. The Municipality will
      conduct several inspections during these 5 weeks to verify that the Site
      Notice has not been removed or become illegible.

      It may be necessary to submit an environmental impact statement to
      accompany the planning application where the local planning authority
      considers, by reference to the characteristics of the development, its
      location or the characteristics of the environmental impacts from the
      development, that the development is likely to have a signi cant e ect on
      the environment.


      If the local planning authority considers that the development is likely to
      have a signi cant e ect on a site protected under the Habitats or Birds
      Directives (or sites proposed for protection under the Habitats or Birds
      Directives), it may also be necessary to submit an 'appropriate assessment'
      of the predicted impacts of the proposed development on the relevant
      protected site(s).


      According to Development Contribution Scheme 2013 - 2015 (under Section                                                    Page 14  
      48, Planning & Development Act, 2000 as amended), BuildCo is required to

       According to Development Contribution Scheme 2013 - 2015 (under Section
       48, Planning & Development Act, 2000 as amended), BuildCo is required to
       pay a general contribution fee in respect of general public infrastructure and
       facilities bene ting development in the area of the planning authority.


       The time speci ed by law (55 days) represents the minimum statutory time
       period within which the planning authority may, at rst instance, make a
       decision on the planning application. This time period may be, and in most
       cases is, exceeded by the relevant local planning authority requesting
       further information from the applicant. A valid request for further
       information has the e ect of stopping time running against the planning
       authority.


       However, in practice it takes around 90 days in practice, on the basis that a
       request for further information is made by the planning authority. This
       period does not include the time for appeal of the decision made by the local
       planning authority at rst instance. An appeal against the decision made by
       the local planning authority may be made to the planning appeals board (An
       Bord Pleanála) within 4 weeks of the date of the decision of the local planning
       authority. The appeal process, which may include an oral hearing, may delay
       the commencement of construction between 4-8 months or even more.

       Pursuant to Regulation 6 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work
       Regulations, 2006, BuildCo must appoint in writing for every project:
       • A competent project supervisor for the design process
       • A competent project supervisor for the construction stage

       Pursuant to Regulation 10 of the Regulations, BuildCo has a duty to give
       notice in writing to the Health and Safety Authority in their approved forms
       (Forms AF1 & AF2) of these appointments. The forms are to be sent by
       registered post to the Health and Safety Authority, Metropolitan Building.
       BuildCo must receive written con rmation of acceptance of the
       appointments.


       Provision of these forms is required under the relevant health and safety
       legislation, and is therefore a procedure that must be complied with.

       In accordance with the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 (No. 50 of 2013)
       enacted on 25 December 2013 a range of statutory water services functions
       transfer from local authorities to Irish Water from 1st January 2014. Dún
       Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been noti ed by the Department of
       the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that after 1st January
       2014, planning authorities, when granting permission, should no longer
       include a portion in respect of water services infrastructure in any
       development contribution applied. A charge in respect of water services
       infrastructure provision in respect of developments granted planning
       permission after 1st January 2014 will instead be levied by Irish Water.
       Therefore the development charges are now €74.10/sq.m. , excluding any
       contribution towards water services.

       A re safety certi cate is required before a building may be lawfully occupied.
       In order to ensure that the design and construction is in accordance with the
       relevant statutory re safety requirements, an application for the re safety
       certi cate should be made prior to construction or, at a minimum, 90 days
       prior to completion, to prevent any delay in the occupation of the building.                            Page 15

       Agency : Fire Safety Department of Local Authority

       A re safety certi cate is required before a building may be lawfully occupied.
       In order to ensure that the design and construction is in accordance with the
       relevant statutory re safety requirements, an application for the re safety
       certi cate should be made prior to construction or, at a minimum, 90 days
       prior to completion, to prevent any delay in the occupation of the building.

       The application must be accompanied by a re safety report, drawings and
       speci cations and the relevant fee. A revised re safety certi cate may be
       required where planning permission is granted for a revised design or where
       a signi cant revision is made to the design for which a re safety certi cate
       has been granted.

       It is important that the full application fee accompany the application for a
        re safety certi cate, as the application may otherwise be deemed invalid
       and returned by the local authority.

       Builders have the option to commence development without waiting until a
       Fire Safety Certi cate is issued, according to the 7 Day Notice I. 351 of 2009
       Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2009).


       Once a rm submits a valid application for a re safety certi cate, it may
       submit a 7-day notice to the local planning authority and sign a statutory
       declaration that Part B (Fire Safety) requirements will be complied with. Once
       this is carried out and upon expiration of the 7-day period, the developer can
       commence development without waiting for the re safety certi cate to be
       issued.

       However, the 7-day notice can only be submitted where a valid application
       for a re safety certi cate is made. A re safety certi cate will still have to be
       issued for the development. The time period for the issuance of a re safety
       certi cate remains (up to) 78 days.



   5   Request and obtain a disability access certi cate                                  60 days    EUR 800
       Agency : Planning Department - Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council

       Since January 2010, all buildings have to obtain a disability access certi cate.
       An architect or other professional prepares the access certi cate application
       to con rm that the design of the building meets the recommendations of
       Part M of the Building Control Regulations. The Building Control Authority
       (Local Authority) reviews the application and proceeds to issue the certi cate
       if it is in order.


       To avoid potentially expensive remedial work, it would be considered good
       practice to apply for the certi cate at the same time as the re safety
       certi cate, thereby ensuring that the certi cate and any conditions
       pertaining to it are known prior to the commencement of works.


       A building may not be operated or occupied unless such a certi cate has
       been granted.

      After the completed application has been received, the client’s business and site
      details will be set up on ESB’s system. The client then receives an acknowledgement
      with a reference number.

      Based on the information on the application form, ESB Networks will issue the client
      with a quotation and a connection agreement. This agreement includes:
      • The Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) for the client’s new premises. This is a
      unique reference number that identi es the client’s connection point to the
      electricity network.
      • The Maximum Import Capacity (MIC) of the new premises. The MIC equates to the
      contracted electricity capacity for the premises based on information provided to
      ESB Networks.

      Once these have been received and the client has signed a Connection Agreement
      with the utility, ESB Networks can commence construction work on the electricity
      infrastructure required for the premises.
      ESB Networks will also need to apply for a Road Opening License at the Roadworks

      extension, or modi cation to an existing installation, he/she is obliged to test and
      certify that the installation complies with current standards. These standards are set
      by the Electro Technical Council of Ireland.
      The registered electrical contractor who is certifying the electrical wiring must send
      the Electro Technical Council of Ireland wiring certi cate to his/her regulatory body
      quoting the client’s Meter Point Reference Number and address before connection
      can be made live. Every client should receive a copy of an Electrical Completion
      Certi cate whenever electrical work is completed.
      In situations where an “Electro Technical Council of Ireland” Electrical Completion
      Certi cate is required, ESB Networks must obtain electronically a validated Electrical
      Completion Certi cate from the electrical contractor's regulatory body before
      connecting the electrical installation to the network.
      The electrical contractor is normally member of one of the following regulating
      bodies: Electrical Contractors Safety & Standards Association Ltd (ECSSA) and
      Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland (RECI).
      Among the situations where an Electro Technical Council of Ireland certi cate is
      required are:
      • Building any new house or premises
      • Building an extension to an existing house or premises
      • Altering the internal electrical wiring in any existing house or premises
      • Reconnecting a house or premises (if vacant for more than 6 months)
      • Connecting electric fences and other installations

      connection from ESB Networks
      Agency : Electricity Supply Board (ESB) Networks Ltd.

      If the customer’s Maximum Import Capacity is less than 30 kVA, they can contact the
      Supplier of their choice or they may contact ESB Networks to request that their
      connection be made live.
      If the customer’s Maximum Import Capacity is greater than or equal to 30kVA, the
      client must register with an electricity supplier of their choice.
      The client will need the following information when contacting a supplier:
      • Meter Point Reference Number
      • The address of the new premises
      • Name and contact details
      The supplier will pass on the information to ESB Networks.
      The client is assumed to obtain their electricity from ESB Independent Energy (ESBIE)
      that is part of ESB Group.
      Once the external works are done and ESB Networks has received both the signed
      Connection Agreement and con rmation that a valid Electro Technical Council of
      Ireland wiring certi cate has been issued for the client’s premises, connection can be
      energized.

       system is available while the supporting documents are sent by post (
       mailing usually takes 2 days) Supporting documentation will include the deed
       of transfer and payment of the appropriate fees.



       It is normally the case that the buyer's solicitor will prepare the deed of
       transfer and will send the draft deed to the seller's solicitor for approval. In
       certain cases, the vendor's solicitor will draft the deed (e.g. lease of building
       estate grant). When the deed of transfer is nally agreed between the
       parties, it will be signed by the parties to the transfer.




       On completion of the application the Property Registration Authority will
       advise the lodging party of the completion.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                       Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest        registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population        secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                     In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit         only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set

                                                           Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                           (BizBank) are used:
                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                           largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                           second largest business city.
                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                           The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                           a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Time (in years)      0.4               Mirage's management would file a petition for appointment of an examiner, supported by
                                       proof that the company is unable to pay its debts but has a reasonable prospect of survival
                                       as a going concern. This position must also be confirmed in a report prepared by an
                                       independent accountant, which must be filed together with the petition. From the time of
                                       the filing of the petition, the company is under protection of the court and all enforcement
                                       actions will be stayed. The court will hear the petition ex parte and appoint a temporary
                                       examiner. The court will then schedule a full hearing 7-10 days ahead, which must be
                                       advertised to the creditors, so that they can attend. If the court decides to accept the
                                       petition, it will also appoint a permanent examiner. The protection period lasts 70 days, but
                                       can be extended to 100 days, during which time the examiner must propose a scheme of
                                       arrangement, which will be circulated to all creditors. At least one class of creditors must
                                       accept the arrangement in order for it to be submitted to the court. The court will hold a
                                       confirmation hearing (usually within 2 weeks of when the scheme of arrangement is
                                       submitted). If the court approves the scheme of arrangement, it becomes binding on all
                                       creditors, even those who did not support it. A scheme of arrangement frequently involves a
                                       new investor acquiring all or substantially all of the shareholding in the company together
                                       with a write down of the company’s debt across a range of classes of creditors.

Cost (% of           9.0               The majority of the expenses are comprised of attorney fees (up to 5%) and fees of the
estate)                                examiner (4%). Other expenses include services provided by other professionals such as
                                       accountants (0.5%) and court fees (0.2%).
