About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Environment Department

      The Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management
      System Act entered into e ect on April 3, 2005, providing legal bases and
      procedures for assessing likely environmental impact, organization of eco-
      management and audit schemes, and the legal bases for awarding eco-labels
      to prevent environmental damage.

      The environmental impact shall be assessed upon application for, or
      application for amendment of, a development consent (a building permit or
      a permit for the building use), if the proposed activity, which is the basis for
      the application for, or the amendment of, the development consent,
      potentially results in signi cant environmental impact. A person who
      proposes an activity and intends to carry it out shall organize an
      environmental impact assessment and carry all the resulting expenses.


      It is up to the local municipality to decide whether it is at all necessary to
      assess the environmental impact of the project. There are two types of
      grounds for requiring an environmental impact assessment to be carried
      out. First of all there are instances in which it is obligatory to conduct
      environmental impact assessment. The hypothetical warehouse project
      should not qualify under this category. The second category is such that the
      local municipality is required to consider whether an environmental impact
      assessment is needed or not and if the local municipality decides that it is
      necessary, it must give reasons for such a decision. The hypothetical
      warehouse project might qualify under this category if for example
      considered to be (a part of) an industrial area development. Besides the fact
      that it is in hands of municipality to make a decision, there are no clear
      de nitions on what does not exactly fall into category of projects that do not
      qualify for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). It is likely BuildCo would
      need to obtain a clearance but not the full scale EIA approval.

      The Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management
      System Act established a term of 30 days for issuing a decision to approve
      the environmental impact assessment report. The time may vary from 30
      days to 1 year for actual EIA approval both from Municipality and
      Environmental Supervisory Authority. It would also include a period of public
      hearing. However, since we are just getting a project clearance for a
      relatively simple project, the procedure should be completed within 30 days.

  3   Obtain project clearance from Health Care Department                                  28 days               no charge

       hearing. However, since we are just getting a project clearance for a
Doing relatively

   3   Obtain project clearance from Health Care Department                            28 days   no charge
       Agency : Health Care Department

       A clearance for the building project from the Health Care Department is not
       required. However, this authority may be consulted by the local government
       before granting or refusing the building permit. In practice, the local
       government may ask the applicant to personally communicate with these
       authorities. There is no time limits for such communication. Further, the
       Health Care Department has the right to perform state supervision over
       compliance with occupational health requirements when the warehouse is
       put into use.

   4   Obtain project clearance from Labor Inspections Department                      27 days   no charge
       Agency : Labor Inspections Department

       A clearance for the building project from the Labor Inspections Department
       is not required by law in the stage prior to approval of the building permit.
       However, this authority may be consulted by the local government before
       granting or refusing the building permit. In practice, the local government
       may ask the applicant to personally communicate with these authorities. The
       Labor Inspectorate has the right to perform state supervision over
       compliance with occupational safety requirements during construction and
       when the warehouse is put into use. According to Occupational Health and
       Safety Act, Paragraph 13, the employer is obliged to notify the local
       department of the Labor Inspectorate in writing or in a format which can be
       reproduced in writing before commencing activities. The noti cation can
       also be made also via the Customer Portal of the Labor Inspectorate
       (https://eti.ti.ee/login/index?redir=true).

       Paragraph 26 provides that after receiving the noti cation, an inspector has
       the obligation to carry out an inspection. The employee of the Labor
       Inspectorate must set up the time of inspection with the owner of the
       building, but in extraordinary situations, the inspector has the right to
       commence supervision without informing the employer in advance.

   5   Obtain building permit                                                          25 days   EUR 585
       Agency : Municipality

       To obtain a building permit from the Municipality, BuildCo must submit an
       application for a construction permit and construction design
       documentation. According to the Building Act, the local government must
       approve or refuse the issuance of a building permit within 20 days from the
       date on which the application for the building permit and the building design
       documentation are submitted. The Municipality conducts internal
       consultations with various departments and agencies. However in practice,
       BuildCo is likely to follow up with these authorities.

       Since June 2009, an energy certi cate for the new building must be included
       in the application. The energy audit is assumed to be conducted by the
       engineers of the newly built warehouse.

       Prior to construction, BuildCo must notify the Municipality that construction
       will begin.

       During construction, the Municipality may monitor the work to verify
                                                                                                             Page 14

      Agency : Municipality

      During construction, the Municipality may monitor the work to verify
      compliance with the requirements. If the construction does not comply with
      the applicable rules and regulations, the construction will be stopped.



  7   Receive on-site inspection by Estonian Technical Surveillance Authority            1 day     no charge
      Agency : Technical Surveillance Authority

      According to the amendment of Building Act from January 1, 2008 Estonian
      Technical Surveillance Authority may carry out state surveillance on
      construction sites, in addition to the surveillance exercised by the
      Municipality. Before the building is being used or in case of an emergency in
      a building that is already in use, the Estonian Technical Surveillance
      Authority does not have to inform the owner about the inspection
      beforehand. In other situations, the owner must be noti ed at least 24 hours
      in advance.


      The number of inspections is not limited by law -- it is up to the discretion of
      the Technical Surveillance Authority. However it should comply with the
      principles of good administration practices. The costs of the evaluation
      services, of the expert assessment of building design documentation and of
      the evaluation of construction works ordered to verify conformity to the
      requirements are borne by the Technical Surveillance Authority. If it is
      established that the construction works or building design documentation
      do not conform to the established requirements, the owner of the
      construction works has to compensate the Technical Surveillance Authority
      for the costs of the evaluation services ordered to verify conformity to the
      requirements, including the costs of expert assessment or evaluation.



  8   Apply for permit of use and request nal inspection from Municipality               1 day     EUR 64
      Agency : Municipality

      The local municipality has discretion as to which agencies can be engaged in
      the inspection before the permit to use the building is issued. According to
      the law, the local municipality must issue a permit to use the building (or
      issue a refusal to not use the building) within 20 days from the date on which
      the last document necessary for the issue of the permit is submitted.
      However, in practice it takes longer. BuildCo would have the right to le an
      action to the administrative court in case the 20-day limit is not respected. In
      practice though few companies le lawsuits against the authorities.

  9   Receive nal inspection from Municipality and obtain permit of use                  25 days   no charge
      Agency : Municipality

      The date and the time of the nal inspection is agreed between the builder
      and the municipal authority. The permit for use is not issued before the nal
      inspection is carried out.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                      Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest       registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population       secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                    In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow

                                                          Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding         liquidation        Because Mirage is not able to make its loan payment and the bank will not renegotiate the
                                      loan, it is most probable that BizBank would first send Mirage a bankruptcy warning in case
                                      of non-payment. If Mirage still fails to pay, BizBank will file a bankruptcy petition against
                                      Mirage. Moreover, because Mirage is already unable to pay, the board of Mirage would itself

                                      Reorganization could not be considered in a situation where Mirage is already in fact unable
                                      to meet its financial obligations as opposed to a situation where the difficulty to meet its
                                      obligations is likely to occur in the future.

Outcome            piecemeal sale     In order to keep the hotel operating, creditors would have to finance its operations. The
                                      bank would likely be interested in returning its money as soon as possible and not in lending
                                      more money to the hotel, therefore, it would advocate for a piecemeal sale of assets. The

                                      of first instance) declaring bankruptcy, which can be appealed within 15 days as of
                                      publication of bankruptcy notice and the judgment of the court of second instance can also
                                      be appealed within 30 days; - first general meeting of creditors appointing the bankruptcy
                                      committee, confirming the insolvency representative (trustee), and deciding on the
                                      continuation or termination of the activities of the undertaking (within 15-30 days as of
                                      declaration of bankruptcy); - notification of claims by creditors (no later than 2 months as of

                                      recognition of claims, recovery of assets, etc. (may take years); - preparation of the proposal
                                      for distribution of assets by the representative after the general meeting for the defense of
                                      claims, which may be contested within 10 days in court; - sale of assets (time varies); -
                                      distribution of assets according to the distribution plan (1 month).
