About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       The account of numerical data study is necessary to identify the measures of
       the plot of land on which the warehouse will be built. The cost of this study is
       approximately MKD 6,000.00 -- MKD 10,000.00. In Skopje there are a number
       of private cadastre o ces that can be hired by BuildCo. The private cadastre

       Agency : Private Agency

       Before construction starts, BuildCo must hire a private company or an
       engineer licensed to perform construction supervision. The supervisory
       party would oversee construction from beginning to end, perform the
       technical inspection after construction, and prepare the nal report. A
       company would usually charge between 1% and 2% of the value of
       construction.

       According to article 10 of the Law on Amending the Construction Law (O cial
       Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia br.144/12), supervisor of construction
       works for facilities intended for storehouses and warehouses cannot de ne
       a price higher than 0.5% of the value of the facility. However, in practice,
       supervisory rms still charge 1-2% of the construction value, because it is a
       free market interaction and the building companies prefer paying the market
       price in order to obtain a high quality service.

  1   Submit application to EVN and await energy consent                                11 calendar days       MKD 0
      Agency : EVN

      The energy consent is a three page document which contains approval for
      the connection and a sketch with the connection point. Documents to be
      submitted by the warehouse owner are as follows: property paper,
      construction permit (or decision for legalization of the warehouse if not
      legally built), urban plan documentation of the warehouse, electric single line
      diagram of the warehouse, company's (customer's) documentation, and
      certi cation of licensed electric company for internal electric wiring
      compliance of the warehouse.

  2   Pay estimate and await completion of external works by EVN                        80 calendar days       MKD 558,600
      Agency : EVN

      After the customer receives the energy consent, he/she signs the connection
      contract and pays the rst installment featured on the estimate. EVN then
      hires a subcontractor to do the works and gathers the necessary paperwork
      - after which the second installment is due. The EVN subcontractor does the
      design, purchases and installs the transformer, cables and meter. The
      subcontractor cannot start the external connection works without prior
      written consent of the project from EVN. Moreover, the subcontractor is
      obliged to inform EVN of the nishing of di erent works phases. When the
      works are done, the subcontractor informs EVN, and a technical commission
      with relevant experts is formed. The commission comes to the site to check
      the external connection works, after which the technical acceptance for the
      power connection is granted. The owner does not need to be present during
      the inspection because the ownership of the equipment belongs to EVN.

      electricity ow
      Agency : EVN

      EVN informs the customer when the connection is completed. The customer
      then needs to pay the third installment of the estimate, request the
      electricity ow and sign a purchase-sale agreement with EVN. EVN technical
      commission will then proceed to open the meter and energize the
      warehouse within a week from the day of the submission of the request.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Tax liability incurs on the date of conclusion of the agreement for transfer of
      ownership. The base of tax on sales of real estate is the market value of the
      real estate at the moment of the tax liability. Previously paid to the Public
      Revenue Authority, the payment of this tax moved from the Revenue
      Authority to the Municipalities in 2005. According to the Law on Property
      Taxes (O cial Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia, No. 61, dated
      September 13th 2004), the tax rates are determined by each Municipality,
      and the Municipality administration is authorized to determine and collect
      the property taxes as per the location of the real property. The Mayor should
      pass and deliver the decision for the amount of property tax within 10 days
      from the day when the taxpayer submitted the application. The rate of tax on
      sale of real estate is proportional and equals 2-4% of the determined market
      value of the property. If the two parties are companies registered for VAT,
      the seller will pay 18% VAT on the determined purchase price.

                                                                                                             moment the

       E-lodging is now being introduced in Macedonia: the E-Counter application
       for professional users (available at www.katastar.gov.mk ), enables
       submission of applications for data and changes electronically, using
       electronic signature. The fee for the service and the administrative tax can
       be paid by credit card via the virtual POS terminal. In order to use this
       service, the professional users must sign a contract with the AREC and must
       have internet access, scanner, digital signature issued by an authorized
       body, and payment card. With the E-Counter, the citizen via the Notaries can
       conduct purchase or sale of the property and can quickly record a mortgage,
       without coming to the AREC front desk in person.

                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category

                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.



What the indicators measure                            Case study assumptions

Time required to enforce a contract through the        The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a sales contract
courts (calendar days)                                 between 2 domestic businesses. The case study assumes that the court
                                                       hears an expert on the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes

                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the

The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

  Time for trial and to obtain the judgment

                                                           several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the            - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                        and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                            economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                           - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                           - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the

                                                           equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                 - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                           commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                           - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                    - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                   - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                     - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                           movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                    loan. Within 30 days of the filling, the court will issue a decision commencing insolvency
                                    proceeding, appointing a bankruptcy trustee and call for creditors to file their claims within
                                    15 days of publication of the announcement in the Official Gazette. Then the examination
                                    hearing must be appoint in the next 45 days. From the day when bankruptcy proceeding was

                                    the bankruptcy trustee prepares a charter of claims within 15 days after filling the claims
                                    from the creditors and on the examination hearing the bankruptcy trustee shall give a
                                    statement for each of the received claims. Creditors who are not satisfied with trustee`s
                                    decision can start separate litigation proceedings. On the first meeting of the creditors, the
                                    creditors have to decide whether to proceed with reorganization or with liquidation of the
                                    company. If the creditors decide to liquidate the company, the bankruptcy assets will be sold
                                    by e- commerce with public auction. The whole process of sale must end within 90 days of
                                    the made decision for liquidation. If the Company's assets can`t be sold after three auctions
                                    than the judge in 8 days will make a decision for distribution of the bankruptcy assets among
                                    the creditors.
