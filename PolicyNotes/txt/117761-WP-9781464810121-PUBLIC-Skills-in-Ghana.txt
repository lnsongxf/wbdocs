The past two decades in Ghana have been marked by steady economic progress,
which has transformed the country into a lower-middle-income economy, accom-
panied by a decline in poverty, increases in incomes for families, improvements in
health, and expanded educational opportunities. As Ghana looks forward to a
future of economic growth, it needs to regain growth from the 2016 slowdown,
including improving competitiveness and economic diversification and raising
labor productivity. A well-equipped workforce will be key to obtaining these goals.
The Government of Ghana and its development partners such as the World Bank
have long recognized the importance of investments in human capital. Insufficient
skills in young people will be an obstacle to improving competitiveness in all sec-
tors across the economy, be they informal or formal, in traditional sectors or in the
modern areas such as information and telecommunications technologies.
   An agenda for improving skills in the workforce relies on being able to ­ identify
where the more practical and profitable investments in the current skills profile
should be made. To that end, Skills Toward Employment and Productivity
(STEP) is an innovative tool used across the world to assess the education, cogni-
tive, work-related, and socioemotional skills stock in a population, as well as the
impact of these traits on employment and earnings. Ghana is among the first two
countries (along with Kenya) in Sub-Saharan Africa where this systematic assess-
ment of skills has been carried out. The evidence collected through this assess-
ment shows that the multidimensional nature of skills requires nurturing from
early childhood education to school and university systems, as well as through
school-based and on-the-job training. This broad concept of skills has a significant
impact both on jobs and on earnings, and the relationship is also mutual: jobs
attract and reward skills. The information from the Stepping Up Skills in Urban
Ghana study provides detailed insights for policy makers. These insights cover
areas including investments in early childhood education, the role of improve-
ments in the quality of education, and the creation of incentives for economic
actors to invest in on-the-job training to improve Ghana’s competitiveness and
the well-being of its citizens.

Overview




Introduction
Ghana stands at the cusp of extraordinary opportunity. Since the country’s
return to democratic rule and the advent of the Fourth Republic, per capita
gross domestic product (GDP, current US$, PPP [purchasing power parity])
has increased almost fourfold, from US$375 in 1993 to US$1,442 in 2014.
In 2011, Ghana was the only African economy to demonstrate double-digit
economic growth, surpassing 14 percent that year. In the aftermath of the
Chinese economic slowdown and the slump in global commodities markets,
Ghana’s growth tempered to 4 percent in 2014 but is expected to recover
above 8 percent in the medium term as the country begins exploiting signifi-
cant oil and gas resources.
   Throughout the period of the Fourth Republic, fertility rates have remained
relatively high, falling from 5.3 births per female in 1993 to 4.2 in 2014.
Concurrently, the proportion of children under the age of 15 in the total popula-
tion declined only marginally from 43 percent in 1993 to 39 percent in 2014.
As a consequence, Ghana’s labor force has grown rapidly, from approximately
6.5 million in 1993 to 11.3 million in 2014, and is expected to continue to grow
in the coming decades.
   Population growth has also contributed to an erosion of the effects of buoyant
economic growth on poverty reduction. Although the country has made progress
in reducing poverty—with the proportion of the population living below the
government’s poverty line falling from 32 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in
2012—stubborn disparities persist with regard to access to economic, social, and
political opportunities.
   Inequity is particularly evident in the differences between the populations
of the poorer northern Savannah regions and the rest of the country. In the
three northernmost administrative regions of the country, more than half, or

xvi	                                                                                         Overview


       58 ­ percent, of the population falls below the poverty line, compared to
       19 ­percent in the seven administrative districts of the south of the country. The
       spatial distribution of poverty and economic opportunity, in turn, has led to
       significant migration from north to south, and a swelling of the ranks of the
       urban labor force.
           Nevertheless, a significant economic dividend is implicit in Ghana’s increas-
       ingly abundant urban labor force. If current and future generations of workers
       can be empowered to realize their potential in a vibrant and increasingly
       competitive economy, the prospect of sustained poverty reduction, further
       economic development, and the reaping of benefits associated with a demo-
       graphic transition could profoundly reshape Ghana’s society and economy for
       future generations.
           Equipping current and future generations of workers with the skills they
       need to improve their livelihoods and to drive increases in national productivity
       and competitiveness requires that these workers have skills appropriately aligned
       with the needs of a growing economy. Some skills are innate, arbitrarily assigned
       through the accident of birth. Other skills are acquired through education, work,
       and life experience. The primary means through which a government can
       develop the skills of its labor force is through policies and strategies implemented
       through the education system.
           Jobs form the foundation of economic development, rising living standards,
       increases in productivity, and improved social cohesion. Equipping people with
       appropriate skills to access meaningful work constitutes the means for achieving
       these objectives. This report, premised on the Skills Toward Employment and
       Productivity (STEP) framework, considers education the instrument for learning
       and acquiring skills and the key for accessing employment.
           Although the Ghanaian government has made significant progress in
       expanding access to basic education, many challenges persist in the education
       sector. These include the low quality of learning in both basic and post-basic
       education, inequity of access, and the limited capacity of the education system
       to equip beneficiaries with skills aligned with increasing competitiveness and
       productivity in the economy. If education and training institutions are unable
       to provide the skills demanded by the market, economic inefficiencies could
       be compounded.
           Skills development strategies can be effective only if they are appropriately
       calibrated to the needs of the economy and only if they take into account the
       current skills endowment of the existing labor force. The most effective skills
       development strategies are informed by evidence, and effective implementation
       requires the ongoing collection of data to gauge shifting demand for skills and the
       changing character of the labor force and economy at large.
           To date, evidence regarding the stock of existing skills in Ghana’s labor force
       is relatively underdeveloped. The precise measurement of the prevalence of dif-
       ferent categories of skills within the population is required for the effective
       design of policy interventions that target improved training to reduce skill gaps

aligned with the needs of specific sectors, improvement in productivity, and
increased employability of workers. With the data it gathers, the first STEP
household survey aims, in part, to address this deficiency through a rigorous
analysis of the skills endowment of urban Ghanaian adults.
    The STEP survey was carried out between September 2011 and December
2013 in Ghana, as part of the first wave of surveys initiated under the STEP
Skills Measurement Program. The Ghanaian sample consists of about 3,000
individuals between 15 and 64 years of age, living in urban areas across
71 ­ districts. In addition to standardized information captured at the household
level, the STEP survey collects information regarding the level of skill, level of
education completed, and work history. On skills, the STEP survey includes
information about (i) self-reported cognitive skills (that is, a subjective assess-
ment of an individual’s use of foundation skills—reading, writing, and numeracy—​
at work and in daily life); (ii) assessed cognitive skills (that is, an objective
assessment of reading literacy based on the International Adult Literacy Survey);
(iii) socioemotional skills (that is, personality traits, behavior, and risk and time
preferences); and (iv) job-specific skills (that is, an indirect assessment of skills
used at work).
    The STEP framework is structured according to five iterative steps and
associated objectives: (i) getting children off to the right start; (ii) ensuring
that all students learn; (iii) building job-relevant skills; (iv) encouraging entre-
preneurship and innovation; and (v) facilitating labor mobility and job match-
ing. Ultimately, if these five steps are achieved, Ghana will significantly
advance the likelihood of realizing the potential of its labor force, with con-
siderable positive implications for the livelihoods of its people, poverty reduc-
tion, improved productivity, ­     economic development, and the betterment of
society at large.

   This report is divided into eight chapters:

•	 Chapter 1 of the report describes Ghana’s economic, social, and demographic
   trends and the current challenges faced by the education system. Chapter 2
   outlines the report’s framework for enquiry and a detailed description of the
   STEP framework. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the STEP survey’s sam-
   pling methodology, a description of methodologies used to measure each
   subset of skills, and limitations to the analysis.

         •	 Drawing on data collected through the STEP survey, chapter 4 describes the
            education profile of the urban adult population; explores trends in preschool,
            primary, secondary, and tertiary completion rates, disaggregated by age group,
            gender, and region; explores the effect of socioeconomic and demographic
            factors on educational attainment, dropout rates, and age of entry into the
            education system; and looks at the relationship between education attainment
            and inequality.
         •	 Chapter 5 analyzes labor force participation, employment status, and
            underemployment; the correlation between labor market status and skills
            ­
            and education; and regional disparities in education and labor market
            opportunity.
         •	 Chapter 6 focuses on the use of cognitive skills (both self-reported and
            assessed), socioemotional skills, and technical skills. The authors analyze the
            mismatch between self-reported and assessed cognitive skills and the mis-
            match between respondents who report high levels of education attainment
            but who performed poorly when these skills were tested and vice versa. This
            section of the report aims to answer the following research questions: How
            do socioemotional skills relate to cognitive skills? Does inequality with regard
            to years of schooling reflect inequality in cognitive skills? What are the char-
            acteristics of respondents who under- or over-report cognitive ability? Do
            incremental increases in educational achievement result in more developed
            skill sets?
         •	 Chapter 7 looks at the association between education and skills and labor
            market opportunity. It discusses the extent to which it is worthwhile for
            individuals to invest in (or for others to subsidize) education and/or skills
            development and to what extent these investments inform the develop-
            ment of skills demanded by the economy. In so doing, this chapter aims to
            answer the following research questions: Does education lead to better job
            market opportunities? Do skilled (educated) workers demonstrate higher
            earnings? Does education inculcate job-relevant skills? Which skills matter
            the most for employability? How much of the wage premium accruing
            to educated people is explained by skills? Is training relevant in producing
            good skills?
         •	 Section 8 quantifies the magnitude of unused skills and underexploited poten-
            tial within the labor force, examines the proportion of the employed popula-
            tion who do not use their skills at work, and weighs evidence of skills and
            education mismatching in the labor market.


         Key Findings
         The Educational Profile of Ghana’s Adult Urban Population
         Ghana has made significant progress in expanding access to basic education,
         having achieved near universal access to primary education. However, challenges
         persist with regard to improving the quality of basic education to enhance
         learning outcomes and to expanding access to post-basic levels of education.
         ­

Overview	                                                                             xix


Moreover, a significant gender gap in educational achievement is evident for all
levels of education in Ghana.
   The expansion of early childhood education (ECE) in Ghana’s urban areas
has dramatically improved, and participation in ECE is positively correlated
with household socioeconomic status and the intensity with which workers use
basic skills. Only 30 percent of Ghanaians between ages 45 and 64 attended an
ECE program compared to 87 percent of the youngest generation surveyed.
Seventy-seven percent of adults living in households in the upper socioeco-
nomic brackets had participated in an ECE program, compared to 49 percent of
adults in the poorest households. Adults with ECE are more likely to read and
write regularly and do so with greater intensity.
   Approximately two-thirds of students who complete primary school do so
without demonstrating proficiency in core subject areas. In terms of the quality
of senior high school (SHS) programs, a large disparity in further educational
attainment is evident between students attending the highest-performing schools
and the rest of the sector.
   The highest-performing 10 percent of high schools account for 90 percent of
students entering university. There are significant regional, gender-based, and
income-based disparities in access to and the returns accruing to post-basic edu-
cation. Pass rates for the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) vary
greatly by region, with the poorest performance evident in the administrative
regions of the north. The magnitude of difference in BECE pass rates for the
north and south are upwards of 60 percent.
   Access to tertiary education has not changed substantially over time. Over
three generations, the percentage of people with a tertiary qualification increased
by only two percentage points, from 11 percent for adults ages 45 to 64 to
13 percent for respondents in the generation ages 25 to 34.
   A child’s age on entry to the school system is correlated with educational
achievement. Officially, children should commence formal schooling at the age
of six; however, in practice many children enter school later, with negative impli-
cations for further education. Approximately 51 percent of those with incom-
plete primary education enrolled in primary school at eight years of age, whereas
89 percent of those with postsecondary education enrolled at the official age of
entry.
   Approximately one out of four members of the adult labor force dropped out
of school prior to completing the highest grade of the level of education they had
enrolled in, with the highest rates of dropout evident in the primary and junior
high school (JHS) cycles of education. The most commonly cited reason for
dropping out of school before the age of 16 is a lack of money for out-of-pocket
expenses, regardless of the child’s socioeconomic status.

Labor Force Participation and Employment Status Characteristics
The overall urban labor force participation rate in Ghana is 67 percent: 62 per-
cent of respondents ages 15 to 64 years reported being employed, 5 percent
reported being unemployed but looking for work, 23 percent were deemed

      economically inactive (22 percent in education, 1 percent had retired), and
      10 percent fell into the category “Not in Education, Employment, or Training”
      (NEET).
         A significant majority of the employed labor force works in the informal
      ­
      sector, primarily in self-employed work (66 percent) or as informal wage workers
      (20 percent). Only 15 percent of the employed population is engaged in salaried
      employment in the formal sector. However, these trends are changing, with
      younger generations less likely to be self-employed and more likely to hold sala-
      ried employment in formal or informal firms.
         Although female workers are as likely to be employed as their male coun-
      terparts, a significant gender gap exists in the quality of employment enjoyed
      by male and female workers. Across all age groups, female workers are more
      likely than male workers to be self-employed. Approximately half of male
      workers are self-employed, with the remaining share split almost evenly
      between formal and informal wage employment. By contrast, 79 percent of
      female workers are self-employed, and only 7 percent are retained as employ-
      ees in the formal sector.
         A worker’s level of education is strongly associated with employment
      status. Approximately 37 percent of workers holding a tertiary qualification
      ­
      work in the informal sector (20 percent as self-employed and 17 percent as
      informal employees), compared to 99 percent of workers with no formal edu-
      cation (86 percent as self-employed and 13 percent as informal employees).
      A key determinant of a worker’s likelihood of accessing a job in the formal
      wage sector is education. Approximately 44 percent of workers in the formal
      sector have a tertiary education, 32 percent graduated from SHS, and 24 per-
      cent report JHS education or less.
         The level of educational attainment is also strongly associated with employ-
      ment in higher-skilled occupations. The majority of the employed population
      works in low-skilled occupations in the informal sector, and just 13 percent of
      the working population is employed in high-skilled occupations, concentrated in
      the formal sector. SHS and tertiary graduates are more likely to be employed in
      mid- or high-skilled occupations than are workers with lower levels of educa-
      tional attainment. Approximately 29 percent of SHS graduates are employed
      in the high-value-added services sector, compared to just 3 and 8 percent of
      workers in this sector having terminated their education following the primary
      and JHS cycles, respectively.

      The Skills Profile of Ghana’s Adult Urban Population
      As mentioned previously, the STEP survey collects information about cognitive
      skills by asking people about their use of numeracy, reading, and writing skills and
      through an objective assessment of their reading proficiency.
         According to self-reporting by those surveyed, working-age Ghanaians
      use their numeracy skills on a regular basis, regardless of their level of edu-
      cation. At the same time, the use of reading and writing skills is significantly


                      Stepping Up Skills in Urban Ghana  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-1012-1
Overview	                                                                                xxi


lower and strongly correlates with the level of education and with employ-
ment status. The intensity of the use of reading skills is higher among SHS
graduates and highest for respondents with a tertiary qualification. All
respondents who received tertiary education report using their reading and
writing skills on a regular basis, and approximately 64 and 60 percent of
the population with primary education report the regular use of reading
and writing skills, respectively. Nevertheless, even among those who com-
pleted tertiary education, almost half write only with low intensity.
Similarly, 84 percent of formal employees reported using their reading and
writing skills on a daily basis, compared with approximately 41 percent of
informal wageworkers and 21 percent of self-employed workers.
    Overall, the use of reading and writing skills has intensified over time, with the
youngest cohort surveyed reporting regular use of their writing (89 percent of
respondents) and reading (90 percent) skills, compared to the oldest age cohort
of workers who reported a lower regular use of reading (41 percent of respon-
dents) and writing (41 percent). The results of the reading proficiency tests mir-
ror the respondents’ self-reported levels of skill use.
    Educational attainment was highly predictive of relative success on the
Core Literacy Test component of the survey. Ninety-three percent of those
who failed the test reported educational attainment of JHS or less (42 percent
report no formal education, and 33 percent attended JHS), whereas about
57 percent of those who passed the test have at least an SHS education and
approximately 21 percent report having tertiary education.
    Nevertheless, average performance across all three measures of reading is
low. Respondents who reported using their reading and writing skills more fre-
quently performed better in sentence processing and passage comprehension tests
than those who did not. However, poor performance on the print vocabulary
subcomponent of the reading assessment was relatively uniform across all
­
subgroups. Respondents with higher reported levels of educational attainment
performed better on all aspects of the reading component. Younger respon-
dents were more likely to perform better in sentence and passage comprehen-
sion tests than older respondents.
    Respondents with lower socioeconomic status, and for whom English was not
their main language at home or at work, were less likely to pass the Core Literacy
Test. Of those who passed the test, 73 percent reported using English as their
primary workplace language, compared with 17 percent of those who failed the
test. However, in light of the fact that the reading test was administered in
English, it is not surprising that a higher percentage of those who passed the test
report speaking English as their primary language at home and work than those
who failed. Of the respondents who were employed, 81 percent of those who
failed the reading test were self-employed and only 3 percent were formal wage-
workers. By contrast, 38 percent of those who passed the reading assessment
were self-employed and 34 percent were formal wageworkers, with one-third
retained in high-skilled occupations. Respondents who passed the reading

        assessment earned on average 274 GHS (approximately US$80) per month
        more than those who failed the test.
           Average performance on the Literacy Exercise Booklets section of the
        test, which allows for an in-depth analysis of reading ability, was very poor.
        Sixty-one percent of the subsample to whom the Literacy Exercise Booklets
        were administered scored on the lowest rung of proficiency. Respondents
        who attained higher scores were more likely to be younger, to have reported
        higher levels of educational attainment (SHS or tertiary), to work in the for-
        mal sector, to have reported the use of English as their primary home or
        workplace language, and to have reported using their reading and writing
        skills more intensively.
           Finally, it is worth mentioning that the data show a substantial mismatch
        between self-reported use of skills and tested literacy: of the sample as a whole,
        approximately 69 percent of adults reported reading regularly, but only
        42 ­percent passed the Core Literacy Test component of the literacy assessment.
        However, the poor results in the Core test may reflect poor English literacy
        rather than present a true measurement of general reading skills. Those who
        reported being able to read but who then failed the Core test are more likely to
        be women, more likely to work in low-skilled occupations and to be less edu-
        cated, and less likely to work in the high-value-added sector. Respondents who
        reported being able to read but then failed the Core test also earn approxi-
        mately 41 percent less than those who reported being able to read and who
        passed the Core test.
           The analysis suggests that socioemotional skills are closely associated with
        educational attainment and labor market outcomes. Individuals with higher
        self-reported scores relative to the “Big Five” personality traits (stability, agree-
        ableness, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness) also had higher educa-
        tional attainment. Similarly, individuals scoring higher on the Big Five
        personality traits, and who demonstrated lower levels of hostile bias, are less
        likely to be self-employed.
           The association between socioemotional skills and labor market outcomes is
        reversed nevertheless when controlling for education. This finding confirms
        that education and socioemotional skills are (positively) correlated and also
        suggests that the development of socioemotional skills might be one of the
        channels through which education can contribute to better labor market
        outcomes.

        Job-Specific Skills
        Employment in the formal sector requires that a worker be capable of regularly
        learning new skills at work, more frequently involves the supervision of others’
        work, and more often requires workers to make presentations. Survey data dem-
        onstrate that work in the informal sector is less cognitively demanding, more
        repetitive, and more physically demanding. Self-employed workers reported
        greater autonomy at work and a greater incidence of repetitive tasks than did
        wage workers.

Overview	                                                                               xxiii



Further Education and Training
Approximately 32 percent of the population surveyed had actively engaged in
activities to further develop their skills in the year prior to taking the survey.
More than one in four respondents surveyed by STEP reported participating in
an apprenticeship, and less than 7 percent had participated in a training course
of 30 hours or more.
   Apprenticeship-based training is more common among self-employed work-
ers, whereas formal wageworkers are more likely to enroll in skills training courses.
Approximately 26 percent of formal workers reported attending a work-related
or personal skills training course in the year prior to the survey, compared to 3
and 6 percent of self-employed and informal wageworkers, respectively. On the
other hand, approximately 38 percent of self-employed and 25 percent of wage-
workers had participated in an apprenticeship in the 12 months prior to the
survey.

Returns to Education and Skills
The analysis demonstrates that an additional year of education is associated
with an increase of 6–10 percent in monthly earnings. After controlling for
socioeconomic characteristics, primary education is associated with no distin-
guishable earnings premium for people with no formal education or incomplete
primary education. On the contrary, the wage premium accruing to SHS and
tertiary graduates is 29–79 percent (SHS) and 112–172 percent (tertiary)
higher than the average wage of workers with no formal education or incom-
plete primary education. The premium for workers with JHS over workers with
no formal education or incomplete primary education is much lower (35–59
percent).
   Returns to education and skills vary by type of employment and with
respect to the type of skill. An additional year of education increases
the monthly earnings of informal wageworkers by 4–6 percent, compared to
7–10 percent for formal wageworkers. However, taking into account the
individual’s skills (cognitive, socioemotional, and job-related skills), the
earnings premium associated with any additional year of education decreases
­
by 2 percent.
   The premium accruing to a female worker through an additional year of
education is higher than that accruing to male workers (between 9 and 13 per-
cent for female workers, compared to between 6 and 9 percent for men). For
male workers, a pronounced premium associated with educational attainment
becomes evident only at the tertiary level, whereas the data suggest that sub-
stantial payoffs accrue to female workers from JHS and above. Furthermore,
with respect to skills, the pro-women gender gap is persistent at tertiary educa-
tion (female workers with tertiary education make 164 percent more than
those without compared to a 118 percent advantage for men). However, this
apparent gender gap may be misleading because it does not take into account
the fact that average labor market participation and educational attainments
are lower for female workers.

        Evidence of an Unrealized Potential in the Labor Force
        An apparent mismatch between skills and their use at work could reflect unex-
        ploited human capital in the labor force. Within the overall population of
        employed adults, the evidence suggests that there is a subset of individuals who
        use their cognitive and computer skills at home but not at work. Moreover,
        there is a disproportionately large number of young workers who report being
        able to use a computer but who are not required to do so at work. The evidence
        suggests that the greatest residue of unexploited potential is located in low-
        skilled occupations and low-value-added sectors. Approximately 34 percent of
        self-employed workers report reading at home but never using this skill at
        work. On the other hand, only 6 percent of formal sector workers report this
        skills mismatch.

Country Context




Economic, Social, and Demographic Trends
In the contemporary period, Ghana has achieved sustained economic growth
and significant poverty reduction. The country has experienced 20 years of
positive economic growth (in the range of 4–5 percent) and in 2011, with year-
on-year growth of 14.4 percent, was one of only seven countries in the world,
and the only country in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to achieve double-digit
economic growth (IMF 2012).1
   Improved economic performance has been accompanied by significant pov-
erty reduction, underpinned by rural development and increasing urbanization.
In rural areas, small-scale agriculture has benefitted from improved agricultural
productivity (notably in cocoa), rising incomes, and rising domestic demand.
Concurrently, Ghana’s rapidly growing urban centers have led to a significant
expansion of the service sector and a growing labor force, inclusive of migrants
from rural areas who have been absorbed into better-paying jobs in both the
formal and the informal sectors of the economy.
   Despite this impressive progress, deep inequity continues to characterize
Ghanaian society and is reflected in significant disparities in access to economic,
social, and political opportunities. This is especially evident when observing dif-
ferences in access to opportunity between the populations of the poorer northern
“Savannah regions” and the rest of the country.
   The bulk of Ghana’s poverty is concentrated in the three northernmost
administrative regions of the country: the Upper East, Upper West, and
Northern regions. These Savannah regions (home to approximately one quarter
of the country’s population) are the locus of an average poverty rate of
58 ­percent, compared to 19 percent in the seven administrative districts in the
south of the country. Between 1995 and 2005, the number of people living in
poverty fell by 2.5 million in the south. Over the same period the number of
people living in poverty in the north increased by 0.9 million, although
the poverty rate for this area declined because of an absolute increase in
the population.2

         Unemployment and underemployment in Ghana are structural in nature,
     which is not atypical in SSA. However, when demographic trends are taken
     into account, the structural nature of the challenges becomes more pro-
     nounced, with most economies on the continent being unable to generate suf-
     ficient rates of growth to create the jobs required to absorb the ever-increasing
     number of workers entering the labor force. The scale of the challenge is evi-
     dent in the fact that formal private sector employment accounts for only a
     small proportion of available manpower.
         To sustain and accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction, Ghana’s
     education strategy is focused on building the skills profile of the youth demo-
     graphic (IMF 2012). The urgent need to intervene in this regard is underlined by
     a national median age of approximately 20 years (UNDP 2011). Although the
     country’s youth demonstrate the highest levels of educational attainment relative
     to older generational cohorts, younger workers also depend most on salaried
     employment because of the inability of rural agriculture to sustain workers and
     their families and the contingent movement of migrants from the countryside to
     Ghana’s urban centers.
         From a developmental perspective, the most important demographic trend
     is the pace and character of migration from the northern regions of the country
     to the south (figure 1.1). Migrants to cities in search of jobs, education, skills,
     and business opportunities disproportionately include large family groups with
     children of school-going age and unemployed youth with poor educational
     attainment.

Education and Skills
Ghana has made significant progress in expanding access to basic education over
the course of the past 15 years. Having achieved near universal access to primary
education, the country now faces two new urgent challenges: (i) improving the
quality of basic education to enhance learning outcomes and (ii) expanding
access beyond basic levels of education.
   The majority of students receiving upper secondary education in Ghana are
enrolled in three-year senior high schools (SHS), following the completion of
11 years of basic education (comprising preprimary school, primary school,
and junior high school [JHS]) (see box 1.1 for more information on Ghana’s
education system). The government intends to universalize access to upper sec-
ondary education by enabling students who are unable to afford fees to attend
secondary school at no charge.
   Informal apprenticeships currently equip many more workers with skills
than do formal public technical and vocational education and training (TVET)
programs.3 Fewer than 10 percent of workers with technical and vocational skills
acquired their skills through public TVET institutions. Moreover, there are
approximately one and a half times as many trainees enrolled in private TVET
institutions as in public institutions, and the number of students engaged in
informal apprenticeships is 10 times that of students enrolled in the formal
TVET sector.




Box 1.1 The Ghanaian Education System
In theory, the age range for children and young people engaged in the Ghanaian education
system spans from 3 to 21 years. The educational system in Ghana consists of the following
cycles or levels of education:

•	 Preschool, equivalent to U.S. kindergarten (ages 4–5)
•	 Primary school (ages 6–11)
•	 Junior high school (JHS), equivalent to U.S. middle school (ages 12–14)
•	 Senior high school (SHS), equivalent to U.S. high school (ages 15–17)
•	 Tertiary education/institution, equivalent to U.S. college/university (ages 18–21)

   A full cycle of basic education is optimally provided over the course of 11 years, comprising
two years of kindergarten, six years of primary school, and three years of JHS. Ghanaian children
enter class one (first grade) during the calendar year in which they reach their sixth birthdays.
During the first three years, the medium of instruction is either English or a combination of
English and local languages.
   JHS education comprises forms 1 through 3 (U.S. grades seven through nine). Admission to
JHS is open to any student who has completed primary class six. There is no entrance exam,
and JHS education is considered integral to the ­  country’s nine-year cycle of basic education,
to which all Ghanaian children are entitled. At the end of JHS form 3 (ninth grade), students sit
                                                                                 box continues next page

     Box 1.1  The Ghanaian Education System (continued)

     for the  Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) in nine or ten subjects. The BECE is
     administered and graded by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC).
         Admission to SHS is based exclusively on a student’s BECE results. After JHS, students may
     choose to go into different streams within the SHS system or to pursue further skills acquisition
     through an apprenticeship scheme with some support from the government. All SHS courses
     prepare students for university education, but most TVET students are likely to join the labor
     market once they graduate.
         SHS consists of forms 4 through 6 (equivalent to U.S. grades 10 through 12). The core SHS
     curriculum comprises six subjects—English, science, mathematics, social studies, physical
     education, and religious and moral education—which are studied throughout the three-year
     SHS cycle. Students undergo examinations only in the first four of these subjects. To complete
     a full course of SHS education, each student must choose—in addition to the core ­curriculum—
     one program (general arts, general science, agriculture, economics, business, or technical and
     vocational) and three or four elective subjects from within that chosen program.
         At the end of the three-year SHS cycle, all students are required to sit the West African
     Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE). Usually, the student’s overall score is deter-
     mined by aggregating the student’s grades in his or her elective subjects and then adding this
     score to the aggregate score of the student’s best “core” subjects, with scores in English and
     mathematics considered first. The Ministry of Education considers any SHS graduate with an
     aggregate score of 24 (a D average) or better to be a successful school-leaver, equivalent to a
     graduate of a U.S. high school. Entrance to universities is by examination following the com-
     pletion of SHS. Students obtaining aggregate scores of 36 or above (six subjects) on the
     WASSCE can enter university. After completing SHS, students also have the option to pursue
     further education through a polytechnic.



     Persistent Challenges in Education
     Despite Ghana’s steady economic growth and improved access to basic educa-
     tion, many challenges persistent in the education sector. Among other things, the
     primary challenges concern

     •	 The poor quality of learning outcomes, in both basic and post-basic
        education;
     •	 Inequity of access, especially in secondary education; and
     •	 The limited capacity of the education system to create relevant skills aligned
        with increasing competitiveness and productivity within the economy.

        The National Education Assessment carried out biannually since 2005 shows
     a persistent trend: approximately two-thirds of students who complete primary
     school do so without demonstrating proficiency in core subject areas. In terms of
     the quality of SHS programs, the annual WASSCE demonstrates a large disparity
     in further educational attainment between students attending the 100 highest-
                                                                performing 10 percent
     performing schools and the rest of the sector. The highest-­

Country Context 	                                                                      5


of high schools account for 90 percent of students entering university.
Approximately 65–70 percent of SHS graduates do not continue education at
the tertiary level. Students exiting the SHS cycle with low WASSCE scores are
unable to access tertiary education, with many of these graduates going on to
enroll in some form of training or apprenticeship program.
    There are significant regional, gender-based, and income-based disparities in
access to, and the relevance of, post-basic education. The 2010 Population and
Housing Census and the 2013 Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) demon-
strate very low pass rates for the BECE in the Upper East (11 percent), Volta
(17 percent), and Northern and Upper West (both 22 percent) administrative
regions, compared to high pass rates in the Greater Accra (90 percent), Western
(88 percent), Brong-Ahafo (86 percent), and Ashanti (81.5 percent) regions
(GSS 2013, 2014).
    Survey data also demonstrate that the limited capacity of Ghana’s education
and training systems inhibits their ability to produce human capital of sufficient
quality to meet the needs of the labor market and to drive a more competitive
and diversified economy. Many JHS and SHS graduates are unable to find jobs
in the formal sector, or are unable to pursue further education and training
because of poor performance in exit examinations, a lack of information, and/or
the suboptimal supply of training providers. Consequently, many JHS and SHS
graduates are limited to self-employment or finding employment in the informal
sector. According to data from the most recent National Census (2010), approxi-
mately two-thirds of the adult population is self-employed, and the proportion
of employment accounted for by the formal private sector has declined since
2000 (GSS 2013). Formal (public or private) employment accounts for only
17 percent of total employment and is disproportionately concentrated in urban
areas, although a relatively large minority of public employees—primarily
teachers—are present in rural areas.
­
    Skills development in Ghana encompasses the inculcation of foundational, or
basic, skills (literacy, numeracy); transferable and soft skills; and technical and
vocational skills. These skills are acquired over the course of a lifetime through
formal education, training, and higher education; through on-the-job and profes-
sional training; and through the family, community, and media. The majority of
young Ghanaians acquire technical and vocational skills through informal on-
the-job apprenticeships (Darvas and Palmer 2014). Although the scale and scope
of Ghana’s TVET systems are difficult to measure, clear opportunities exist for
further skills development at the intersection of education, youth, and the needs
of the labor market (Darvas and Palmer 2014).
    Enterprise surveys demonstrate mixed perceptions on the part of firms with
respect to the quality of workers’ skills and the extent to which poor skills act as
a constraint to improved economic performance (Darvas and Palmer 2014).
However, in light of the demonstrable inadequacy of the supply of relevant and
quality skills to the economy, a more deliberate analysis of enterprise survey data
is required to more effectively understand the underlying causes of the apparent
low demand for skills. If strategies for the further development of Ghana’s

     human capital and economic development are to be successful, it is imperative
     that skills development strategies are premised on a thorough understanding of
     the existing supply of and demand for skills, as well as of the use of skills in the
     economy, in order to more effectively match the supply of skills to demand
     (Campbell 2012; Darvas and Palmer 2014).
        Despite the central role skills play in shaping employment outcomes, there is
     very little information about the distribution of different types of skills in the
     Ghanaian labor force or of their contribution to labor market outcomes.
     Ultimately, the paucity of relevant information undermines the design of more
     effective skills development policies and programs (World Bank 2014). The Skills
     Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) project—through its use of a
     framework enabling the analysis of Ghana’s labor market conditions based on
     internationally comparable skills data—will help to address this knowledge gap
     and assist in the development of policies aligned to the needs of the economy.

Conceptual Framework: Why Is It
Important to Focus on Skills?




Introduction
It is generally recognized that there is a strong positive correlation between the
educational and skills profile of the workforce and a country’s per capita gross
domestic product (GDP)—which is intended here as a proxy of productivity.
Thus, education and training are the foundations for a skilled workforce and
would benefit not only individuals but also the economy as a whole.
    If the education and the training system are of low quality, however,
workers will be ill-prepared for the labor market. This could lead to several
types of mismatches. For example, the education level of an individual may
not match his or her skills, or individuals may overrate their own skills, thus
leading to a mismatch between self-reported skills and tested skills. In
another type of mismatch, workers may lack the skills required for available
jobs or lack access to high-quality training programs that would increase
their skill level and enable them to apply for higher-productivity jobs. As a
result, many employees are either under- or overqualified for their occupa-
tions. These mismatches lead to a loss of human capital and show that having
post-basic or higher education does not automatically translate into getting
a good job. In all of these cases of mismatch, investments in education may
not pay off.
    Education policy makers and other education stakeholders in Ghana are pay-
ing more attention to learning outcomes by testing all students from early grades
through basic and post-basic education. Various research and diagnostic work has
highlighted the fact that the reading and mathematics proficiency of Ghana’s
students continues to be below acceptable levels. This means that most of them
are unable to reach important milestones in literacy, to access post-basic educa-
tion, or to develop a foundation for lifelong learning. As a result, their employ-
ment prospects are limited. Policy makers have identified the low quality of
inputs and the limited relevance of science and technology education as being

     among the main causes of these limited prospects. Policy makers also highlight
     Ghana’s large disparities in learning outcomes and related inequalities in the
     delivery of education services.1
        Furthermore, policy makers and researchers have also homed in on several
     persistent challenges on the demand side. Not only do services and educational
     performance vary greatly by students’ social and economic status and by geogra-
     phy, but demand for skills, job opportunities, productivity, and expectations also
     vary widely and are affected by similar disparities.
        Despite the central role played by skills in improving employment outcomes
     and increasing productivity and growth in Ghana, information about the supply
     and demand of skills is sparse. Assessments of supply have largely focused on the
     outputs of mostly school and tertiary-level education and training institutions,
     whereas assessments of demand rely only on the responses to a few questions in
     enterprise surveys and rate-of-return analyses based on the last three Ghana
     Living Standard Surveys (GLSS) carried out in 1995, 1999, and 2005.2 Recently,
     more systemic analyses, surveys, and impact evaluations have been initiated, and
     we hope their results will inform future policy making.
        The lack of data and information on the skills endowment has made it difficult
     to design skills development policies and programs in Ghana, as in many other
     Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Precise measurement of the prevalence of
     different types of skills among the population is needed to inform the design of
     public policies to reduce skill gaps in specific sectors, to increase the employ-
     ability of the population, to improve training, and to enhance productivity.
        The Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) framework consid-
     ers education as the instrument that enables individuals to learn and acquire
     skills, and subsequently access employment (box 2.1). Jobs are the foundation of
     economic development, improved standards of living, improved productivity,




     Box 2.1 Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP)
     The STEP framework (see figure B2.1.1) is informed by the following five interlinked steps:

     •	 Step 1. Getting children off to the right start—by developing the technical, cognitive, and
        behavioral skills conducive to high productivity and flexibility in the work environment
        through early child development (ECD), emphasizing nutrition, stimulation, and basic cog-
        nitive skills. Research shows that the handicaps built early in life are difficult if not impossible
        to remedy later in life and that effective ECD programs can have a very high payoff.
     •	 Step 2. Ensuring that all students learn—by building stronger systems with clear learning
        standards, good teachers, adequate resources, and a proper regulatory environment.
        Lessons from research and ground experience indicate that key decisions about education
        systems involve how much autonomy to allow and to whom, accountability from whom and
        for what, and how to assess performance and results.
                                                                                       box continues next page

•	 Step 3. Building job-relevant skills that employers demand—by developing the right
   incentive framework for both pre-employment and on-the-job training programs and insti-
   tutions (including higher education). There is accumulating experience showing how public
   and private efforts can be combined to achieve more relevant and responsive training
   systems.
•	 Step 4. Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation—by creating an environment that
   encourages investments in knowledge and creativity.
•	 Step 5. Matching the supply of skills with the demand—by moving toward more flexible,
   efficient, and secure labor markets. Avoiding rigid job protection regulations while strength-
   ening income protection systems, complemented by efforts to provide information and
   intermediation services to workers and firms, is the final complementary step transforming
   skills into actual employment and productivity.

and social cohesion. As a consequence, equipping people with the right mix of
skills is the means for achieving these objectives.


Which Skills Are Relevant?
A worker’s skill set comprises different categories of skills, including cognitive
skills, social and behavioral skills, and technical skills (see figure 2.1). These cat-
egories of skills relate to job skills relevant to specific occupations as well as to

                      the labor market (Pierre et al. 2014). Cognitive skills include the use of logic,
                      intuition, and critical thinking, as well as problem-solving skills deployed using
                      acquired knowledge. They also include literacy, numeracy, and the ability to
                      understand complex ideas, to apply lessons accrued through experience, and to
                      analyze problems using logical thought processes. Social and behavioral skills
                      relate to personality traits that are linked to labor market success, such as an
                      individual’s relative openness to new experiences, conscientiousness, extraver-
                      sion, agreeability, and emotional stability. Technical skills range from manual
                      dexterity in the use of complex tools and instruments to occupation-specific
                      knowledge and skills for use in professional and technical occupations such as
                      engineering or medicine.


                      How Are Cognitive, Behavioral, and Technical Skills Formed?
                      The process of skills formation should be considered as a continuum spanning an
                      individual’s life, with critical stages for the development of both cognitive and
                      socioemotional skills. Four features of skills formation are particularly relevant to
                      the development of a skills strategy:

                      1.	Foundational cognitive and behavioral skills are formed early in an individual’s
                         life and serve as a platform upon which other skills are developed. Children
                         who fall behind early face significant disadvantages in catching up with their
                         peers. Non-cognitive skills appear to be more malleable throughout life, but
                         early interventions appear to have significant positive effects for their further
                         development in the longer term.
                      2.	Aggregate skills formation and development benefit from previous invest-
                         ments in skills development and are cumulative over an individual’s life. For
                         example, a child who has learned to read fluently by second grade will be able

   to absorb more in third grade than a child of equivalent age who cannot read
   at the commencement of grade three. This implies that early investments in
   skills development are likely to have a greater longer-term impact on aggregate
   skills formation because it is easier and less costly to develop these skills when
   children are young and most receptive to learning.
3.	Social and behavioral skills are particularly valuable early in a child’s life
   because they support, and benefit from, the development of cognitive skills.
   For example, children who are open to new experiences are more likely to be
   imaginative and creative and to apply themselves at school.
4.	The acquisition of technical and job-specific skills is facilitated by strong cog-
   nitive and behavioral skills acquired earlier in the education system. These
   skills are often acquired last, through technical and vocational education and
   training (TVET), higher education, and on-the-job learning. The skills learned
   in formal education help workers to continuously update their technical skills
   during their working lives.


Understanding the Focus on Adults and Urban Areas
Early investments are smart and cost-effective and prepare future generations of
workers for the labor market. However, skills development strategies should also
focus on maximizing the potential of current generations of workers.
    In recent decades Ghana has experienced large-scale migration from more
rural and comparatively impoverished areas to Ghana’s more prosperous and
urban areas. Migrants are disproportionately young adults who are motivated by
educational opportunities and jobs in cities. Urbanization represents both a chal-
lenge and an opportunity for development because it has been associated with
rising per capita income in Europe, Latin America, and, more recently, Asia.
However, Africa has been an exception in this regard, because of the fact that in
many African countries, including Ghana, industrialization has generally not
accompanied urbanization.
    The majority of migrants to Ghana’s urban areas find employment in the com-
paratively poorly productive informal sector. However, even informal employ-
ment is, in many instances, much more than migrants could aspire to in their
home regions. Equipping migrants with skills aligned with the needs of the urban
labor market would give them a further opportunity for self-improvement.
    Accurately measuring the skills of the adult population is critical for informing
policies aimed at increasing the productivity of those already in the labor force.
Understanding the demographic structure and the socioeconomic status of the
adult population in Ghana, as well as the associations between levels of educa-
tion and an individual’s skills endowment, will help to inform the development
of effective nonformal education and skills development programs aligned with
the specific contextual characteristics of Ghanaian society and the labor force. It
is for this reason that the STEP Skills Measurement Survey (discussed in the next
chapter) is premised on gathering information about the skills endowment of the
adult urban population.

Skills Toward Employment and
Productivity Data




Introduction
The Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) survey provides a
unique opportunity to collect information on the use of skills and skills profi-
ciency in Ghana. The objective of the study is to yield a clearer understanding of
the complex relationship between skills, employment, and productivity. This
chapter discusses the characteristics of the sample used in the Ghana STEP sur-
vey, the data arising from the survey, and the definitions of skill and other vari-
ables used in this analysis.


Data and Sample Characteristics
This household survey was carried out in Ghana as part of the first wave of sur-
veys under the STEP Skills Measurement Program between September 2011 and
December 2013. The Ghanaian sample was gathered through a two-stage random
sampling of households and individuals. It consists of 2,987 individuals between
15 and 64 years of age. Table A.1 in appendix A provides a complete description
of the sample in terms of demographic characteristics, education, language, labor
and employment status, economic sector and occupation, and geographic region.
   It is important to note that the weighted sample represents only the urban
population. Therefore, the findings of this report cannot be extended to the
national level because the urban population is likely to differ from the rural
population along many dimensions. For example, workers in the urban areas are
likely to have higher education levels and to be relatively more concentrated in
the services sector than workers in the rural areas.
   Along with the standard information captured at the household level, the
STEP survey collects extensive information on the skills level, education, and
work history of one individual between ages 15 and 64 randomly selected from

                   each sampled household (figure 3.1). The survey includes three innovative
                   modules on skills: (i) a specially designed assessment of reading literacy and
                   competence to access, identify, integrate, interpret, and evaluate information,
                   scored on the same scale as the test in the Program for the International
                   Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) of the Organisation for Economic
                   Co-operation and Development (OECD); (ii) a battery of questions capturing
                   self-reported information on personality traits and behaviors; and (iii) a series of
                   questions on job-specific skills that the respondent possesses or uses in his
                   or her jobs. The skills of the entire sampled population are captured, irrespec-
                   tive of their labor force status (employed, unemployed, or inactive) or sector
                   of employment.


                   Types of Skills Measured
                   The STEP survey evaluates three categories of skill: (i) cognitive (self-reported
                   and direct assessment); (ii) socioemotional skills; and (iii) job-specific skills.
                   Table 3.1 and appendix B summarize the dimensions of skills captured in each
                   category, and the corresponding survey questions used to create the relevant
                   variables for analysis.

Cognitive Skills
The STEP survey measures cognitive skills in two ways: First, respondents are
asked to report whether and with what intensity they use their reading, writing,
and numeracy skills in daily life and at work (if they work). These measures are
likely to capture a combination of an individual’s actual ability to conduct tasks
involving these skills and their motivation or opportunity to do so. Second,
the survey makes use of an objective literacy assessment to directly measure
cognitive skills. The self-reported questions capturing the use of reading and
writing skills may substantively differ from an individual’s actual ability to read
or write.
   The STEP literacy test has been aligned with a series of large-scale international
surveys, such as the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), the Adult Literacy
and Life Skills Survey (ALL), and the PIAAC. The assessment consists of three
parts: Reading Components, the Core Literacy Test, and the Literacy Exercise

      Booklets, as shown in figure 3.2. The Reading Components focus on foundational
      reading skills, including a respondent’s ability to assess word meaning, process
      sentences, and comprehend passages. The Core Literacy Test consists of eight lit-
      eracy questions, which function as a screen to sort the least literate respondents
      from those with the highest literacy skills. Only respondents who were capable of
      answering two or more questions of the Core Literacy Test correctly are asked to
      complete the Literacy Exercise Booklets. The Booklets are broken down into four
      parts with a total of 18 questions, which allow for a more granular evaluation of
      reading skills among the relatively more literate respondents. All tests are con-
      ducted in English (see box 6.1 for further discussion).
          Cumulatively, the data gathered by the STEP survey consist of: (i) the Reading
      Components score(s),1 (ii) pass/fail information for the Core Literacy Test, and
      (iii) the score obtained in the Exercise Booklets grouped into five levels of com-
      petency (table 3.2), inclusive of descriptions of basic literacy skills from 1, the
      lowest level, to 5, the most advanced level.

      Socioemotional Skills
      Socioemotional skills refer to skills and traits that are not directly related to
      intelligence, such as social, emotional, personality, behavioral, and attitudinal
      skills. The measures used to capture behavioral attributes are less established

Table 3.2 Levels of Reading Proficiency

Literacy Below Level 1 (0–175)
The tasks at this level require the respondent to read brief texts on familiar topics in order to locate a
   single piece of specific information. Only a basic knowledge of vocabulary is required to complete
   these tasks, and the reader is not required to understand the structure of sentences or paragraphs or
   make use of other text features. There is seldom any competing information in the text, and the
   requested information is identical in form to information in the question or directive. Although the
   texts can be continuous, the information can be located as if the text were noncontinuous. Tasks
   below level 1 do not make use of any features specific to digital texts.
Literacy Level 1 (176–225)
Respondents are required to read relatively short digital or continuous print, noncontinuous print, or
   mixed texts to locate a single piece of information that is identical to, or synonymous with, the
   information given in the question or directive. Some tasks may require the respondent to enter
   personal information into a document, in the case of some noncontinuous texts. Little, if any,
   competing information is present. Some tasks may require simple processing of more than one
   piece of information. Tasks at level 1 require knowledge and skill in recognizing basic vocabulary,
   evaluating the meaning of sentences, and reading paragraph text.
Literacy Level 2 (226–275)
At this level the relative complexity of the text increases. Texts may be digital or printed, and may
   comprise continuous, noncontinuous, or mixed types of text. Competing pieces of information may
   be present. The completion of level 2 tasks requires respondents to match the text to information and
   may require the ability to paraphrase or make low-level inferences. Tasks require the respondent to
•	 Cycle through or integrate two or more pieces of information against given criteria;
•	 Compare, contrast, and/or reason about information requested in the question; or
•	 Navigate within digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a document.
Literacy Level 3 (276–325)
Texts at this level are comparatively dense and lengthy, and include continuous, noncontinuous,
   mixed, and/or multiple pages. Respondents must demonstrate an understanding of textual and
   rhetorical structures to successfully complete tasks, especially in the navigation of complex digital
   texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of
   information, and often require varying levels of inference. Many tasks require the respondent to
   construct meaning across larger chunks of text, or perform multistep operations in order to
   identify and formulate responses. Tasks may also require that the respondent disregard irrelevant
   or inappropriate text to answer the question accurately. Competing information is present, but it is
   not more prominent than correct information.
Literacy Level 4 (326–375)
Tasks at this level require respondents to perform multiple-step operations to integrate, interpret,
   and/or synthesize information from complex or lengthy continuous, noncontinuous, mixed, or
   multiple-page texts. Complex inferences and the application of background knowledge may be
   needed to perform successfully. Many tasks require the identification and understanding of one or
   more specific, noncentral ideas in the text to interpret or evaluate subtle evidentiary claims or
   persuasive discursive relationships. Conditional information is frequently present in tasks at this level
   and must be taken into consideration by the respondent. Competing information is present and may
   be as prominent as correct information.
Literacy Level 5 (376–500)
At this level, tasks may require the respondent to search for and integrate information across multiple,
   dense texts; construct syntheses of similar and contrasting ideas or points of view; and/or evaluate
   evidence-based arguments. Application and evaluation of logical and conceptual models of thinking
   may be required to accomplish tasks. Evaluating the reliability of evidentiary sources and selecting
   key information is frequently a requirement to successfully complete tasks. Level 5 tasks require
   respondents to be aware of subtle, rhetorical cues, to make high-level inferences, and/or to use
   specialized background knowledge.

      than those used to measure cognitive skills, in part because of the absence of a
      consensus on the structure and evolution of personality. STEP builds on the
      “Big Five” personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agree-
      ableness, and stability), a widely accepted taxonomy for capturing personality
      traits. This taxonomy has been found to be replicable across cultures and can
      be used to capture the evolution of a personality over an individual’s lifetime
      (John and Srivastava 1999). Measures of grit and hostility bias were also
      included. The survey of socioemotional skills includes a module aimed at
      assessing respondents’ time and risk preferences.

      Job-Specific Skills
      Job-specific skills are task related and build on a combination of cognitive and
      noncognitive skills. The STEP survey asks individuals about specific tasks they
      perform and the skills that they use in their current job. Questions on job-specific
      skills are intended to capture an individual’s technical skills, reflecting his or her
      acquired knowledge in particular areas. Because technical skills are often specific
      to a certain discipline, they are difficult to capture using a survey instrument
      aimed at the general population. As a consequence, the STEP survey focuses on
      a range of skills relevant to performance in multiple jobs.


      Methodology
      This report uses a combination of descriptive statistics, simple probability models
      (to estimate what determines the probability of acquiring education and skills
      and of finding employment), and the Mincer equation (to estimate the returns
      to education and skills). The descriptive analysis includes simple distributions of
      the use and intensity of use of skills across genders, age cohorts, different socio-
      economic statuses, and regions. The estimation is done using the sample weights,
      and the results are representative for the urban population of Ghana. The returns
      to education are estimated using a Mincerian wage regression. The total log
      monthly earnings of the main and second occupation are estimated as a function
      of education and a number of control variables (as detailed in appendix C). The
      sample is restricted to those individuals with monthly earnings different from
      zero, and models are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) with robust
      standard errors. For all skills, dummies of nonresponse (missing variables) have
      been included in the regression.
         These models describe associations between earnings and education or skills
      but do not claim any causal relation. If a person with a college degree earns more
      than a person with lower education it does not necessarily mean that the college
      education is the cause of the difference in pay. Rather, the person who went to
      college might have some characteristics that make him or her more productive in
      the labor market, thus resulting in higher earnings. It is possible, for example, that
      high-ability people self-select themselves into college. Thus, higher productivity
      might be the result of this selection rather than the consequence of the education
      level achieved. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the education premium reﬂects

the returns to education or a higher market value of unobserved skills. In an
attempt to alleviate this selection problem, the regression model included a broad
set of controls. Nevertheless, there are many other observable and unobservable
factors that might affect both the probability of being employed and of working
in specific sectors and occupations and the returns to education.

Education Issues in Ghana




Foundational Skills: Early Childhood Education
Early childhood is a critical stage for long-lasting skills development. Investment
in children between the time of birth and the beginning of primary education
is a major determinant of their future school performance and labor mar-
ket success. Various studies find a strong association between cognitive and
socioemotional skills gained at a young age and school achievement, graduation
rates, and employment outcomes.
    Provision of early childhood education (ECE) in Ghana has dramatically
increased since 2000. Only 30 percent of Ghanaians between the ages of
45 and 64 attended an ECE program (kindergarten, crèche, day care, and/or
nursery school) against 87 percent of the youngest generation ages 15–19 years
old. Interestingly, there are no significant differences in ECE participation
between males and females.
    Participation in preschool is positively correlated with household socioeco-
nomic status. Seventy-seven percent of adults living in households in the upper
socioeconomic brackets participated in an ECE program as compared to
49 ­percent of individuals from the poorest households (figure 4.1). This is con-
sistent across all age cohorts.
    Adults who received ECE are more likely to read and write regularly. Adults
who did not attend preschool programs report lower levels of reading and writing
regularly (47 and 45 percent, respectively) compared with 82 and 77 percent of
those who benefitted from ECE (figure 4.2). Almost all of the population
reported using their numeracy skills on a daily basis. Figure 4.3 demonstrates that
those who participated in ECE also use their reading, writing, and numeracy
with more intensity. Only 27 percent of the adult population of Ghana uses a
computer. A third of those who attended ECE programs use one, whereas only
one in every ten adults who did not attend ECE uses one.
    Over time, access to primary and secondary education has substantially
increased. In fact, most of the population has completed at least primary edu-
cation (80 percent) and junior high school (JHS) (69 percent) (figure 4.4).

      In general, younger generations have more years of schooling than their elders.
       Whereas adults in the 45–64 age cohort have an average of 7.4 years of educa-
      tion, adults ages 20–24 have 2.6 more years of schooling. About 14 percent of
      adults ages 20–24 report not having completed primary education, but the
      equivalent figure was 31 ­     percent among the oldest generation (ages 45–65)
      ­(figure 4.5). Also the proportion of adults who have completed senior high
       school (SHS) has increased substantially over time. About 37 percent of
       adults ages 20–24 have completed SHS against only 13 percent of the oldest
       generation.
           Tertiary education is also increasing but at a slower rate. In three generations
       the percentage of people with a tertiary education increased by only two
       ­
       percentage points, from 11 percent for the 45–64 age group to 13 percent
       among the 25–34 age group (figure 4.5). About 29 percent of the 20–24 age
       cohort is still attending tertiary education, and 5 percent have already graduated
       (see box 4.1 for a discussion of educational attainment and education levels).

      Regional Disparities in Access to Primary Education
      Although primary education attainment among younger adults has increased in
      all regions, the increase, as measured in the Skills Toward Employment and
      Productivity (STEP) survey, was more significant in the Northern, Brong-Ahafo,
      and Volta regions. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that, although similar
      trends are likely to have occurred in the Upper West and Upper East, the STEP

Education Issues in Ghana	                                                                          25




Box 4.1  Definitions of Education Variables
The education variables include five subgroups of respondents: (i) those with no formal educa-
tion or incomplete primary (henceforward called the “No education” or “None” subgroup);
(ii) those with complete primary education; (iii) those who completed junior high school (JHS);
(iv) those who completed senior high school (SHS); and (v) those who completed tertiary
education.
     We define two variables for education: educational attainment and educational level.
Educational attainment identifies the percentage of the population that has completed a spe-
cific education level whereas education level identifies the maximum level of education
achieved. For example, someone whose education level is tertiary has attained primary, sec-
ondary, high school, and tertiary education. Thus, tertiary attainment is the ratio of those with
tertiary-level education to all those who achieved (or are currently attending) a lower level of
education. Notably, educational attainment is age independent. Indeed, at the denominator,
it takes into account only those who, given their age, might have achieved the same level of
education. Thus, for example, tertiary education attainment is the ratio of individuals at least
21 years of age having completed tertiary education to the same age-specific group with
lower educational attainment. The age references for each educational level are defined as
following: 11 years old and above for primary level, 14 years old and above for JHS, 17 years old
and above for SHS, and 21 years old and above for tertiary level.
     Educational attainment is therefore useful for understanding the coverage of a specific
education level within a population. For instance, if 80 percent of the population in a country
has attained primary education, this includes those who have also achieved higher levels of
education. In contrast, when analyzing educational level, the focus is on the highest level com-
pleted by the population. Educational level is useful for analyzing how the overall years of
education completed by individuals might be correlated with their labor force participation,
health, and life outcomes.



survey’s small sample of urban households made it impossible to measure them.
In the Northern region the proportion of people who attained (or currently
attend) primary education increased from 22 percent among adults ages
45–65 to 100 percent among the youngest population. Similarly, in Brong-Ahafo
only 42 percent of the 45–64 cohort attained primary education compared to
96 ­percent of the youngest cohort. The Central region is the only region that is
lagging behind, with only 83 percent of those 15–19 years old having attended
primary education (figure 4.6).


Socioeconomic Disparities
As might be expected, educational attainment increases with household wealth.
More than 36 percent of individuals from the lowest quintile have not com-
pleted formal education compared with only about 19 percent of individuals
from the highest income quintile (figure 4.7).

             Nevertheless, Ghana is far from universal attainment in basic education, even
          among the urban population, and the education disparity is increasing. The rich-
          est segment of the population has been driving most of the improvement in
          education achievement—especially at the secondary level. Educational level has
          increased more quickly among the wealthiest, thus increasing the education gap
          between the poor and the wealthy (figure 4.8).

Constraints for Education: Late Entry, Completion Delay, and Dropouts
Delaying school entry correlates to educational achievement. The average age for
starting school for all Ghanaians is 7 years even though the official entry age is
6 years old. On average, those who completed a higher level of education began
school around the official age of entry. About 51 percent of those who never
complete primary education enroll in school at age 8, whereas 89 percent of
those with a post-secondary education enrolled at the official entry age.
Figure 4.9 shows the average age of school entry and completion for each level
of education achieved compared with the official ages for entry and graduation.
    Although education attainment is increasing, delays in completion remain
prevalent. Primary school should be completed by age 11, JHS by age 14, and
SHS by age 17. However, those whose maximum level of education is primary
graduate at an average age of 16.4. Considering their late entry, it takes them
almost nine years to complete this level, four years more than expected
 figure 4.9). For JHS and SHS, the difference between the actual and expected
(­
ages of graduation decreases, with the difference being about three years for both
JHS and SHS. However, students are graduating from SHS at the age at which
they should be finishing tertiary education instead. Tertiary education is the level
with the highest delay in completion: although the expected age of completion
is 21, the graduation age is on average almost six years later.
    Almost one out of four adults dropped out of school. The dropout rate is high-
est during primary education and JHS: among dropouts, 44 percent left school
before completing primary education, 37 percent while attending JHS, 16 ­   percent
while attending SHS, and 4 percent during tertiary education. Among those
starting primary education, 82 continue with a higher level of education; for
8 percent, primary education is their highest level of education, and 10 percent
dropped out of primary education before completing it (figure 4.10, panel a).

                       dropouts belonged to households with low socioeconomic status when they
                       were 15 years old. Whereas the dropout rate for individuals from the richest
                       households is about 26 percent, this rate increases to 38 percent among the poor-
                       est households (figure 4.10, panel b).

      Note: The figure excludes those who are currently attending school and uses a subjective measure of

   The lack of money for out-of-pocket expenses is the top reason for dropping
out at age 15 for all households, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Among
the poorest households, which suffered the highest dropout rate, 66 percent
mentioned lack of money for fees, uniforms, or school materials as a reason for
dropping out (figure 4.11). High opportunity costs were the second most fre-
quently mentioned reason. These high opportunity costs stemmed from the fact
that students with lower qualifications might (relatively) easily find self-­
employment in the informal sector.


The Gender Gap in Education
The gender gap in education attendance is significant for all levels of education
in Ghana (figure 4.12). For example, at 26 percent, the proportion of female
students completing SHS education is significantly lower than the completion
rate of male SHS students, at 47 percent. Moreover, in primary education,
74 percent of female students enrolling in primary education complete a full
course of primary education, compared to 88 percent for their male counterparts.
The gender gap in the primary completion rate is still significant. Females make
up a larger proportion of adults with no formal education. About 13 ­        percent of
men and 26 percent of women have no or an incomplete primary education.
   Nevertheless, women’s educational attainment at both the primary and second-
ary level is increasing over time (figures 4.13 and 4.14). Within the oldest generation,

   41 percent of women have no formal education (compared with 18 percent of

   against an SHS completion rate of 35 percent among the youngest.
      In sum, the STEP survey data show a clear trend of increases in education
   attainment across generations. Although driven mostly by deprived regions
   catching up with the rest of the country, these increases were also led by the
   highest-income groups. Despite improvements, inequality persists because lower-
   income groups continue to have high opportunity costs.

Labor Market Participation




Introduction
Following the analysis of education attainment based on the Skills Toward
Employment and Productivity (STEP) survey, we analyze the survey’s data on
labor force participation and employment. The labor force participation rate in
Ghana is 67 percent, with 62 percent reported to be working and only 5 percent
to be unemployed (figure 5.1, panel a). About 23 percent of the population are
inactive either because they are enrolled in school1 (22 percent) or because they
are retired (1 percent). The remaining 10 percent are “Not in Education,
Employment, or Training” (NEET) (see box 5.1 for definitions of various labor
market terms). The most common reasons that respondents gave for being NEET
were being a housewife, being unfit to work, or having been discouraged from
working (figure 5.1, panel b).
    Unemployment rates are generally low, and inactivity varies very little across
levels of education achieved. Unemployment is up to 6 percent for those with
tertiary education, and the rate of NEET varies between 11 percent for people
with no formal education and those with senior high school (SHS) education and
6 percent among tertiary graduates (figure 5.2).
    The transition from school to work is very slow. Individuals ages 35–44
have the highest employed rate. Whereas unemployment and NEET rates vary
little across age groups, inactivity declines significantly (by about 28 percent-
age points) between the age 20–24 and 25–34 cohorts and falls by 7 additional
percentage points for those ages 35–44 (figure 5.3). Although this trend might
be explained by a change over time of the labor market structure, it also shows
(together with the prevalence of late school entry and late completion) a slow
transition from school to work.

                    and Productivity (STEP) Survey
                    Ghana’s labor force includes people ages 15–64, both employed and unemployed (and those
                    seeking a job). The employed labor force includes those working for pay, those who have found a
                    job but are not working because they are sick or waiting to start their new job, those working
                    for profit, and those in apprenticeships. The unemployed labor force includes those who are
                    looking for job and who have been laid off for 30 days or less. The employment/unemploy-
                    ment rate can be computed as share of employed/unemployed people over the whole popu-
                    lation aged 15–64 or over the labor force (which excludes the inactive population).
                        The inactive population includes people enrolled in school and those who are “Not in
                    Education, Employment, or Training,” or NEET. The NEET rate is defined as a share of NEET over the
                    15- to 64-year-old population, including both the active and inactive population. The inactive
                    subgroup is ultimately broken down to distinguish between married and unmarried people.
                    ­
                        The underemployed are those working less than 40 hours a week (considering the primary
                    and secondary occupations together) and willing to work more hours. Underemployment is
                    defined both as a share of the active labor force and as a share of the employed labor force only.
                        A further distinction is made between those employed in the formal sector and those work-
                    ing in the informal sector. The STEP survey defines informal sector workers as unpaid workers
                    (mainly employed in family businesses), the self-employed and wageworkers who report not
                    having any social security or benefits, or informal wageworkers. The rest of the employed popu-
                    lation constitutes the formal sector, made up predominantly of wageworkers.
                                                                                                            box continues next page

     Occupations are classified into three categories on the basis of the level of skills required.
Low-skilled occupations include agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers; craft and related
trades workers; plant and machine operators and assemblers; and elementary occupations.
Mid-skilled occupations include technicians and associate professionals; clerical support workers;
and service and sales workers. High-skilled occupations include managers and professionals.
     Finally, the economic sectors are classified in four groups: (i) agriculture, fisheries, and mining;
(ii) manufacturing; (iii) low-to-mid-value-added services; and (iv) high-value-added services.
The low-to-mid-value-added services sector includes electricity, gas, steam, and air condition-
ing supply; water supply and sewage; waste management; construction; the wholesale and
retail trade; transportation and storage; accommodation and food services; information and
communication; arts, entertainment, and recreation; other services activities; and the activities
of households and extraterritorial organizations and bodies. The high-value-added services
sector includes financial and insurance activities; real estate activities; professional, scientific,
and technical activities; administrative and support service activities; public administration
and social security; and education, human health, and social work activities.

Wage Employment, Self-Employment, and Formality
Most of the employed labor force works in the informal sector, either as self-
employed (66 percent) or as informal wageworkers (20 percent).2 In fact, only
15 percent of the employed population works as salaried workers in the formal
sector. However, this trend is changing: younger generations are less likely to be
self-employed and more likely to be salaried workers, with either formal or

share increases to 99 percent for those who do not have any formal education
(86 percent as self-employed and 13 percent as informal employees).

Occupation Type
Informality is synonymous with low-skilled occupations. Only 13 percent of
the employed population works in high-skilled occupations, mainly in the
formal sector (figure 5.6). Conversely, the majority is employed in low-skilled
(39 percent) and mid-skilled occupations (48 percent). The prevalence of
workers employed in low- or mid-skilled occupations is relatively higher
among the self-employed than among informal wageworkers.
   Increasing education leads to better occupations. Nevertheless, although this is
true for SHS and/or tertiary graduates, those with primary education and those
with no formal education are equally distributed among low-skilled or mid-skilled
jobs (figure 5.7). Junior high school (JHS) graduates do slightly better, with about
2 percent more working in mid-skilled occupations and about 4 percentage points
fewer in low-skilled occupations. The scenario changes for those with an SHS

in low-skilled occupations. The contrast in terms of high-skilled jobs is even more
pronounced for those with a tertiary education, for whom the figure reaches
70 percent, with only 6 percent working in low-skilled occupations.

Economic Sector of Occupation
The largest share of the employed population works in services (61 percent in
low-to-mid-value-added services and 17 percent in high-value-added services).
The smallest share works in manufacturing (about 10 percent), followed by

      sector are low-skilled occupations (figure 5.8).
          Education attainment increases in line with employment in higher-value eco-
      nomic sectors. Almost half of the workers in the agriculture, fishery, and mining
      sector have no formal education (53 percent) compared to 21 percent in the
      manufacturing sector and 28 percent in the low-to-mid-value-added services
      sector (figure 5.9). The education level of employees in the manufacturing sector
      is very similar to that of workers in the low-to-mid-value-added services sector.

      completing SHS makes a difference, given that about 29 percent of SHS
      graduates work in the high-value-added services sector compared with 3
      and 8 percent for those with primary and JHS educations, respectively
      (­figure 5.10). Nevertheless, 8 percent of SHS graduates still work in the

      Gender Disparities
      On average, labor force participation is very similar for men and women.
      However, when distinguishing between married and unmarried men and women,
      we find a significant gender gap among those who are married. About 89 percent
      of married men are employed compared with about 77 percent of married
      women. Married women are more likely to be out of the labor force than men
      and more likely to be NEET in their capacity as housewives (see figure 5.11).
         The difference between the labor market status of males and females across
      age cohorts is not as significant as might be expected (see figure 5.12). Notably,
      the percentage of females who are NEET is highest for the 20–34 age group,
      which likely correlates to age-specific life events such as childbearing rather than
      a change over time in the women’s labor market status. Increasing access to
      childcare and flexible work options might help to expand labor market participa-
      tion and opportunities for women.
         Although women are as likely as men to be employed, the gender gap is very
      pronounced in the quality of employment. At all ages, females are more likely to
      be self-employed than men. About half of the male working population is

           population) who reported that they were studying and working at the same time.
           The NEET group also included those who reported being employed as unpaid family

Job-Specific Skills, and Literacy




Introduction
To the extent that workers’ productivity depends on their skills and is reflected
by their wages, individuals with more skills should expect higher returns from
their labor market participation. Most studies investigate the returns to invest-
ments in human capital using the education qualification attained. Only a few
recent studies examine the returns to skills (Leuven et al. 2004; Tyler 2004). The
data arising from the Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) survey
provide a unique opportunity to analyze skills across a range of dimensions and
measure their implications for an individual’s well-being and relative opportu-
nity in the labor market.
    As mentioned in chapter 3, the STEP survey focuses on three types of skills:
(i) cognitive skills (self-reported and direct assessment); (ii) socioemotional skills;
and (iii) job-specific skills. The following section will assess the distribution of
each category of skill across population subgroups and thereafter proceed to an
analysis of the returns to skills.


The Use of Cognitive Skills: Overall Use and Intensity of Use
The use of cognitive skills refers to the overall use of reading, writing, and
numeracy skills either in daily life or at work.1 Almost everybody uses numeracy
skills regularly, at all levels of education. Conversely, the regular use of reading
and writing skills is positively correlated with education. The large majority of
survey respondents who attended tertiary education read and write regularly.
This can be compared with the population with a primary education who
reported using their reading (64 percent) and writing skills (60 percent) on a
regular basis (figure 6.1).

          The use of reading and writing skills has increased greatly over time, especially
       among people with low educational attainment. In fact, the highest disparity in
       the use of skills by age groups is among people who completed only primary
       education. In the youngest cohort with only primary education, 89 percent use
       their writing skills and 90 percent use their reading skills. However, less than half
       of the oldest age cohort uses them, with only 40 percent using their reading skills
       and 41 percent using their writing skills (figure 6.2).
          The intensity of the use of various skills is linked to the level of profi-
       ciency and increase with the level of education attained. Overall, 31 percent

  of the population reported not using their reading skills at all. Among the
  69 percent using them regularly, half of the population read with low inten-
  sity, 24 percent read with medium intensity, and 29 percent read with high
  intensity. Among those with no formal education, 87 percent do not read
  at all, and 11 percent read only very short documents, whereas only 1 to
  2 percent read intensively (figure 6.3). Reading intensity is higher among
  graduates of senior high school (SHS) and tertiary education. Nevertheless,
  there are still 40 percent of SHS and 19 percent of tertiary graduates who
  do not read or who do so rarely.
     With regard to writing skills, about 35 percent of the adult population
  reported not writing regularly. Furthermore, most people use their writing skills
  less regularly than their reading skills. As in the case of reading skills, the use of
  writing skills increases with education. Writing skills significantly improve for
  those completing primary education and for those completing SHS and tertiary
  education. Nevertheless, even among those who completed tertiary education,
  almost half write only with low intensity (figure 6.4).
     The use of skills is strongly related to employment status. Formal employment
  requires an intensive and frequent use of reading skills. More than 84 percent of

                    formal wageworkers reported using their computer skills at work, whereas only
                    11 percent of informal wageworkers and less than 3 percent of the self-employed
                    reported using them (figure 6.5).
                       Finally, the percentage of workers who use reading and writing skills and com-
                    puters is significantly higher among those who work in the high-value-added
                    services sector than in any other sectors (figure 6.6).

Job-Relevant (or Task-Related) Skills
Job-relevant skills are task related and consist of a combination of cognitive and
socioemotional skills. The STEP survey includes information on whether employed
people perform any of the following tasks at work: repairing and maintaining elec-
tronic equipment, operating heavy machinery, making presentations, and supervis-
ing others. The survey also asked about the intensity of their computer use, solving
and learning from problems, physical tasks, and autonomy and repetitiveness. For
each skill, a score ranging from 0 to 3 was computed, with 0 being equivalent to
not using the skill, 1 for low use, 2 for medium use, and 3 for high use. The data
also include the respondents’ self-reported information of the educational attain-
ment required to do their job and the time required to learn how to do it.

   Working in the formal sector implies regularly learning new things at
work and more frequently involves supervising others’ work and making pre-
sentations. Conversely, work in the informal sector is less cognitively but more
physically demanding and is more repetitive. Self-employed workers reported
having more autonomy at work and performing more repetitive tasks than
wageworkers ­(figure 6.7).

       Socioemotional Skills
       The survey includes information on socioemotional skills, more specifically on
       the “Big Five” personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agree-
       ableness, and stability), grit, and hostile bias. Hostile bias is a behavioral charac-
       teristic that measures how often the individual believes that others are hostile to
       him or her. In addition, the survey also asks about risk and time preferences. Risk
       lovers have a high score, whereas risk-averse people score low. For time prefer-
       ence, those with a high score are more future oriented and those with a low score
       are more present oriented (more detail about the socioemotional skills can
       be found in appendix B).
           This self-administered section was presented in English to the full survey
       sample. Because of low literacy, about 37 percent of respondents were not able
       to answer. Therefore, the results are not representative of the whole urban popu-
       lation because those who did not complete this section were not randomly
       selected and have different characteristics than those able to answer. For exam-
       ple, nonrespondents are older, less educated, and more likely to work in low-
       skilled occupations than those able to answer (see table D.5 in appendix D for
       further details).
           All questions relating to the measurement of socioemotional skills were
       answered on the following scale: 1 corresponding to “Almost never,” 2 corre-
       sponding to “Some of the time,” 3 corresponding to “Most of the time,” and
       4 ­corresponding to “Almost always.” As reported in figure 6.8, the respondents

scored around 3 in nearly all the personality traits, which means that most of the
time they identify themselves positively with the Big Five and grit. Among them,
extraversion is the trait with the lowest average score (2.5) and conscientiousness
the one with the highest average score (3.2). On average, respondents located
on the middle to low level in the hostile bias scale. With respect to their prefer-
ences, they are on average more likely to be present than future oriented and
more likely to be risk averse than risk loving (figure 6.9).
   There is a growing literature underscoring the role of socioemotional skills in
education and labor market achievement. Figure 6.10 illustrates the estimated
coefficients for socioemotional skills as factors associated with the number of
school years completed, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (age,
gender, maternal education, socioeconomic status at age 15, and the region of
residency). Similarly, in figure 6.11 the same associations are reported for the
estimated probability of attending at least SHS. Finally, figure 6.12 illustrates
the association between socioemotional skills and the probability of being
employed, being self-employed (versus wageworkers), and employment in mid-
to high-skilled occupations (versus low-skilled occupations). Overall, the results
suggest that socioemotional skills are closely associated with educational attain-
ment (figures 6.10 and 6.11). More specifically, a higher self-reported score
relative to the Big Five personality traits is associated with higher educational
attainment.
   Among the personality traits, conscientiousness has the highest positive
correlation, followed by extraversion, openness, and agreeableness. Grit and
emotional stability are also positively associated but in smaller magnitude.

The results are in line with the literature that relates better educational out-
comes to those with higher levels of the Big Five personality traits and grit.
Furthermore, those who are more trustful, more present oriented, and less risk
averse have a higher probability of studying one additional year (figure 6.10).
   The results are substantially confirmed when analyzing the probability of com-
pleting at least SHS education (figure 6.11). In this case, a change in one score unit
of conscientiousness is associated with 14 percentage points on the probability of
completing SHS or tertiary attainment. As with years of education, higher agree-
ableness and stability levels, perceiving others as less hostile, being more present
oriented, and being a risk lover increase the probability of completing higher levels
of education
   Finally, we present the results of the association of socioemotional skills and
the probability of being employed, being self-employed (versus wageworkers),
and working in mid- to high-skill occupations (versus low-skill occupations).
Figure 6.12 shows that in most cases the correlation is not statistically significant

      (once we controlled for education, one of the control variables included in the
      model). However, noncognitive skills seem to play a role in determining the qual-
      ity of the occupation. Individuals with higher levels of the Big Five personality
      traits and lower levels of hostile bias are less likely to be self-employed (and
      therefore more likely to be wageworkers). Interestingly, the only socioemotional
      skill that is significantly associated with having a mid- to high-skill occupation is
      emotional stability, which relates to the ability to cope with stress. Included
      in mid- to high-skill occupations are managers, professionals, clerical support
      workers, and service and sales workers.


      Reading Literacy Assessment
      The reading literacy assessment consists of three parts, all administered in
      English. The first part (Reading Components) evaluates foundation reading
      skills, including word meaning, sentence processing, and passage comprehension.
      The second part (Core Literacy Test) consists of a core literacy assessment that
      is intended to sort the least literate adults from those with higher reading skill
      levels. The Core Literacy Test has a total of eight items, and respondents with
      three or more correct responses are regarded as having met a minimum reading
      literacy threshold (see box 6.1 for more information on the Core Literacy Test).
      The third part (the Literacy Exercise Booklets) is administered only to those
      respondents who have passed the Core Literacy Test (see box 6.1). The Literacy
      Exercise Booklets use a variety of questions drafted around daily life situations.
      They require respondents to carry out different types of tasks such as accessing
      and identifying information (in both text-based and nonprose materials such as
      tables, graphs, and forms), integrating and interpreting information, and evaluat-
      ing information by assessing the relevance, credibility, or appropriateness of the
      material for a particular task. Overall reading proficiency scores are reported on
      a scale ranging between 0 and 500, which is divided into five levels, with level 1
      characterized by the least demanding tasks and level 5 the most demanding. For
      each respondent, 10 plausible values were generated.
          All survey respondents were asked to answer the Core Literacy Test.
      Nevertheless, the nonresponse rate is quite high—about 38 percent (figure 6.13).
      There are two types of nonrespondents: those who fail to complete the section
      because they are unable to read or understand English (“No English”) and those
      who did not complete the tests for multiple reasons (“Missing”).2 Those with no
      English literacy represent 21 percent of the adults, whereas the missing group
      represents 17 percent of the sample.
          The three groups (those who answered the Reading Components and the
      Core Literacy Test, the group with no English literacy, and the missing group) are
      significantly different; therefore, the findings summarized may not be applicable
      to the entire urban sample. For example, those who answered are more likely to
      speak English at work (57 percent versus 18 percent of the missing and those
      with no English together) and to read and write with higher intensity than those
      who did not answer the test. Compared to the nonrespondents, they have higher

Box 6.1  What Does It Mean to Pass the Core Literacy Test?
A sizable proportion of adults reported that they read regularly, even though they did not pass
the minimum literacy threshold of the Core Literacy Test. One reason could be that the tests
are in English whereas many individuals mainly speak a local language. Only 1 percent and 40
percent speak English as their main language at home and at work, respectively (figure B6.1.1).
In contrast, Akan is widely used in daily life. Thus, although the literacy assessment captures
reading proficiency in English, the self-reported measure could be a better proxy of respon-
dents’ capacity to read and write in their daily life in their local language.
    Even though only 40 percent of adults speak English at work, 58 percent of the urban
adults report being able to speak and to read and write English well enough to work in a job
that requires them to do so (figure B6.1.2).
    As expected, the vast majority (90 percent) of those with no English and a third of those
who failed the Core Literacy Test are unable to write, read, or speak in English at work. In con-
trast, among those who passed the Core Literacy Test, about 96 percent report being able to
write, read, and speak English at work. (figure B6.1.3). Notably, about half of those who failed
the Core Literacy Test report being able to use English at work—that is, there is a discrepancy
between the self-reported and measured skills.
    Poor English language literacy does not seem to prevent people from getting a job
(figure B6.1.4). Only 12 percent report that the lack of English kept them from getting a job.
However, those who speak English at work tend to have better-quality jobs. They are more
likely to be formal employees in high-value-added sectors and in high-skill occupations.
They also earn on average 248 GHS per month (or 60 percent) more than those who do not
speak English at work.

education levels, are on average nine years younger, and are more likely to be
students, to be wageworkers rather than self-employed, and to work in high-
value occupations.
   Although one-third of the missing group use English at work, 6 percent of those
with no English literacy do. Furthermore, almost three-quarters (72 percent) of
those with no English did not complete any formal education, whereas only
18 percent of the missing group has no education and 17 percent completed at
least SHS. Also a lower percentage of those with no English reported using their
reading and writing skills compared to those in the missing group.

Reading Components
The Reading Components section evaluates the extent to which participants can
recognize the printed forms of common objects (print vocabulary), comprehend
sentences of varying levels of complexity (sentence processing), and comprehend
the literal meaning of connected text (basic passage comprehension).

          The overall performance is low in all three sections (figure 6.14). Sentence
      processing has the highest percentage of correct answers (41 percent) at all edu-
      cation levels, age groups, and levels of self-reported use of skills. However, it is
      also the section with the highest percentage of nonresponse (19 percent) com-
      pared to 11 percent in print vocabulary and 9 percent in passage comprehension.
      In passage comprehension only 38 percent of the items are answered correctly.
      The lowest performance is in print vocabulary with only 21 percent correct
      answers.
          Respondents reporting to be medium- to high-intensity readers or writers
      answer a higher percentage of correct answers in both the sentence processing and
      passage comprehension tests. The only exception is for the print vocabulary com-
      ponent, which does not vary much across groups (figure 6.15, panels a and b).
          The percentage of correct answers increased with the education level achieved
      (figure 6.16, panel a), and younger cohorts performed better than older age groups
      (figure 6.16, panel b). Those with no formal education answered fewer than
      24 percent of the questions in each section correctly. Even though the results
      improve across all levels of education, there is a more noticeable difference
      between junior high school (JHS) and SHS graduates. Those with a primary or a
      JHS education answered less than one-third of the test questions correctly, whereas
      those with an SHS or a tertiary education answered about 44 percent of the pas-
      sage questions and 46 percent of the sentence questions correctly. However, even
      among those with tertiary education, the scores on the print vocabulary section are
      low, with an average of only 23 percent correct answers—only 4 percentage points

  higher than those in primary education. Younger generations are more likely to
  perform better in the sentence and passage comprehension tests than older age

                                   Core Literacy Test
                                   The Core Literacy Test contains eight basic literacy questions and is designed to
                                   identify those with a minimum level of literacy, namely those who can answer at
                                   least three of the eight questions correctly. Only 42 percent of the respondents
                                   pass this threshold; 17 percent do not answer because they are unable to read the
                                   questions, and 22 percent are missing for other reasons. When taking out the
                                   missing group and adding those with no English to the group that did not pass
                                   the Core Literacy Test, the data show that only half of the population passed
                                   the Core threshold (figure 6.17, panel a). The distribution of correct answers
                                   has a U shape: about 15 percent of the sample answered all questions correctly,
                                   and 14 percent had no correct answer. The median value is about three to four
                                   correct answers (figure 6.17, panel b).
                                      This section provides a profile of those who pass and those who fail the test
                                   (considering together those who failed and the “No English” subgroup) in terms of
                                   gender, age, education level, language, labor and employment status, self-reported
                                   use of skills, socioemotional characteristics, and performance on the Reading
                                   Components and Core Literacy Tests. Full results are reported in appendix D.
                                      Young men with at least an SHS education are most likely to pass the test. More
                                   than half of those who pass the exam were male and seven years younger than the
                                   average. Ninety-three percent of those who failed the test had a JHS education or
                                   lower (42 percent have no formal education and 33 percent attended JHS),
                                   whereas about 57 percent of those who passed the test had at least an SHS educa-
                                   tion and about 21 percent have tertiary education. Notably, about 81 percent of
                                   those who passed the exam had received early childhood education compared
                                   with 47 percent of those who failed.

   The variables for socioeconomic status (SES) and whether English was the
respondent’s main language are both highly correlated with the probability of pass-
ing the test. About 30 percent of those who failed the test have been poor during
their adolescence, and only 15 percent of them passed the Core Literacy Test.
   Although English is Ghana’s official language, only 1 percent of all respon-
dents reported speaking English at home and 40 percent at work. Because the
reading test was in English, it is not surprising that a higher percentage of those
who passed the test than of those who failed reported English as the main lan-
guage at home and at work. Among those who passed the test, 73 percent use
English at work compared with 17 percent of those failing the test.
   Furthermore, the probability of succeeding is higher for those working in the
formal sector and in high-skilled and better-paid occupations. Within the
employed group, 81 percent of those who failed the test are self-employed and
only 3 percent are formal wageworkers. More than half work in mid-skilled occu-
pations and only 3 percent are in high-skilled jobs. In contrast, 38 percent of those
who passed the exam were self-employed and 34 percent were formal wage-
workers. One-third worked in high-skilled occupations and earn on average 274
GHS (approximately US$80) more per month than those who failed the test.
   Self-reported measures of the use and intensity of use of reading and writing
skills is highly correlated with the results of the Core Literacy Test. Nevertheless, a
significant number of people who reported using their skills regularly failed the test.
Indeed, of those who did not pass the test, about 42 and 38 percent, respectively,
reported using their reading and writing skills. The (self-reported) intensity of use
of reading and writing skills is a better predictor of the test results. Indeed, 41 per-
cent of those who pass the test are regular (high-intensive) readers compared to

      only 12 percent of those who fail the test. Similarly, 83 percent of those who fail
      the test self-report being low-intensity writers, and the percentage of low-intensity
      writers is lower (63 percent) among those who did not pass the test.
         The differences among respondents are more significant when we compare
      those who successfully pass the Core Literacy Test with those who do not answer
      any questions correctly. On average the latter have lower education (half of them
      have not completed any formal education); only 5 percent speak English at work
      and none of them use it at home. Eighty percent of these respondents are employed
      and most of them (79 percent) are self-employed. Fewer than one-third of them
      report using their reading skills (only 9 percent of them are high-intensive readers)
      or their writing skills (only 2 percent of them are high-intensive writers).

      Literacy Exercise Booklets
      Those who succeed in the Core Literacy Test are asked to take the Literacy Exercise
      Booklets, which provide a more in-depth evaluation of reading skills. The Literacy
      Booklets are scored on a scale that ranges from 0 to 500 and includes six literacy
      levels from “below level 1” to level 5. The description of the literacy competencies
      for each one of the levels is provided in table 3.2. The “below level 1” includes those
      who failed the Core test (half of the original sample) and an imputed score for
      those who did not answer (about 17 percent of the eligible sample).3
         The average performance on the Literacy Exercise Booklets is very poor.
      Most of the population (61 percent) is below level 1, 18 percent reach level 1,
      17 percent reach level 2, only 4 percent of the respondents reach level 3 or level
      4 (reported together in figure 6.18), and no one is in level 5.
         The level achieved is positively correlated with the number of correct answers
      in the Core Literacy Test. Those with a reading proficiency below level 1 are those
      who did not reach the minimum threshold set for the Core Literacy Test (three
      correct answers) (about 33 percent) and the group with no English literacy (34 per-
      cent). However, 11 percent of those below level 1 passed the Core test but per-
      formed poorly in the subsequent assessment. On the other hand, those in level 3
      and 4 answered correctly at least six of the Core test questions. Indeed, 93 percent
      of them correctly answered seven or more questions in the Core test (figure 6.19).
         Like those passing the Core test, those scoring high in the literacy assessment
      are younger, have higher education (SHS or tertiary), and are more likely to work
      in the formal sector, to use their reading and writing skills more intensively, and
      to use English more frequently at work and at home (figure 6.20).
         Performance on the Literacy Exercise Booklets is correlated with the self-
      reported reading intensity as well. For example, among those who passed the Core
      Literacy Test with three to six correct answers, more of those who self-reported
      using their reading skills with high intensity reached level 1 than did those who
      read with low intensity (52 percent versus 43 percent) and level 2 (25 percent
      versus 14 percent) (figure 6.21). Similarly, among those who completed the whole
      Core Literacy Test correctly, 27 percent of the high-intensity readers reached levels
      3 and 4 on the Literacy Exercise Booklets versus only 7 percent of those who self-
      reported reading with low intensity.

 Developing Skills beyond Education: Training and Apprenticeships
 In Ghana 32 percent of the adult population living in urban areas continue
 their skills development by participating in skills training courses, by achiev-
 ing industry- or government-recognized certificates, and through informal
 ­
 apprenticeships. Apprenticeship is the most common: in the 12 months prior
 the survey, 25 percent of adults participated in an apprenticeship, whereas only
 6 percent received a recognized training certificate and less than 7 percent par-
 ticipated in a formal training course of at least 30 hours. It is worth noting that,
 although apprenticeship is more common for older age cohorts (figure 6.22,
 panel b) and among those with JHS or lower education, training is more com-
 mon for those with tertiary education (figure 6.22, panel a).
     After completing each level of formal education, students might continue
 with the next level of formal education or leave the education system and take
 an apprenticeship instead. As shown in figure 6.23, apprenticeship does not
 replace formal education. Indeed, most of people who complete an education
 level either decide to drop out of school or continue in formal education. Among
 those completing primary education, only 4 percent left the education system for
 an apprenticeship, 65 percent start JHS, and 10 percent drop out. The percent of
 those opting for an apprenticeship is the highest among those completing JHS:
 13 percent of them choose an apprenticeship while 30 percent continue to SHS.
     Formal workers generally have more training outside the formal education
 system, whereas apprenticeship is more common among the self-employed.
 Twenty-six percent of formal workers participated in work-related or personal-
 related skill training courses, 25 percent participated in apprenticeships, and
 14 percent achieved an industry- or government-recognized certificate. About 38
 percent of the self-employed participate in an apprenticeship (figure 6.24).
 Apprenticeships are also more common among those working in low-skilled
 occupations and in the manufacturing sector (figure 6.25). The most common

 Notes
 	 1.	See appendix B for a definition of skills use and intensity of use variables.
 	 2.	This group includes for example those refusing to begin the test booklet (because of
      time constraints, not wanting to bother, or other general refusal), those who began the
      booklet but refused to continue, or those who were unable to continue because of an
      unusual circumstance.
 	 3.	The literacy proficiency is modeled using the item response theory in a scale that
      ranges from 0 to 500. Each point in the 500-point scale has a probability of completing
      the tested item. The higher the score for a given individual, the more proficient the
      individual is. The design divides the test into partially linked booklets so that only a
      portion of the entire battery of items is administered to a single individual. Otherwise,
      the assessment would be too long if every individual had to take the entire battery of
      items. In order to estimate the proficiency level, multiple literacy proficiency scores
      (plausible values) are estimated for each individual on the basis of response to the
      items as well as some background information. Only those who passed the Core had
      to respond to this booklet, providing a finer evaluation of reading skills for the most
      literate respondents. However, imputation allows estimating the reading proficiency
      level for all respondents.

The Returns to Education and Skills:
Building the Job-Relevant Skills
That Employers Demand




Introduction
This section discusses the payoffs of education and skills in term of earnings and
job opportunities. This section answers the following questions in detail: To what
extent does education explain better labor market opportunities and higher earn-
ings? (And at which educational level does further investment in education not
generate a premium?) Do skilled workers have higher earnings? Which skills yield
the best labor market opportunities and higher earnings?
   The analysis carried out in this section involves descriptive statistics and
two multivariate regression models. The first model is a Mincer equation for
earnings. The second is an employment participation model. These models look
at the correlation between education and/or skills and monthly earnings
and employment status, respectively. For the two models we tried different
specifications. The first specification reported in the figures and tables below
does not include any controls and reports only the “pure” correlation between
monthly earnings (or self-employment status) and the education variables
(either years of education or education levels where those with no formal edu-
cation or incomplete primary are used as a reference category). In the second
model, we control for a core set of sociodemographic variables including age,
gender, work experience, economic sectors, and regional dummies. Then we
include a set of controls one at time to see how education returns vary when
taking into account (i) the results of the proficiency assessment test (the num-
ber of correct answers in the Core Literacy Test and the percentage of correct
answers on the Reading Components); (ii) individual personality traits; (iii) the
intensity of the use of cognitive skills; (iv) the intensity of the use of job-specific
skills (cognitive challenges, physical work, autonomy and repetitiveness,

         (v) all of the controls together. All control variables are defined in appendix C
         and full results are reported in appendixes D and E.1


         Returns to Education and Skills
         Our data show some returns for continued education. An additional year of edu-
         cation increases monthly earnings by 3–7 percent (figure 7.1). Notably, primary
         education has no distinguishable premium in terms of earnings, considering those
         with no formal education or incomplete primary education as a base category.
         We also found that market rewards for primary education and junior high school
         (JHS) are lower than those for senior high school (SHS) and higher levels of
         education.2 For higher education, the premium is between 16 and 63 percent for
         SHS graduates and between 77 and 156 percent for tertiary graduates compared
         to workers with no formal education or incomplete primary education. The pre-
         mium for JHS is much lower (between 10 and 40 percent). Faced with uncertain
         and binding constraints, people are more likely to drop out of school before SHS.
         In fact, as mentioned above, the majority of the population (66 percent) leaves
         the education system before SHS.

The Returns to Education and Skills: Building the Job-Relevant Skills That Employers Demand 	                                                                                       71


   Overall skills are an important determinant of earnings beyond education.
In fact the returns of any additional year of education decrease by 2 percentage
points after all skills have been controlled for. The best-paid jobs are those that
require intensive writing and job-specific skills such as the use of the computer
and also involve cognitive challenges and supervision responsibilities. Out of the
“Big Five” personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeable-
ness, and stability), only the estimated coefficient for conscientiousness is statisti-
cally significant (see appendix E). Notably, even after accounting for all skills
(cognitive, socioemotional, and job-specific skills), SHS and tertiary education
have a significantly higher earnings premium.
   The returns to education and skills vary a great deal according to types of
employment, with the lowest returns among self-employed and the highest
among formal wageworkers. One additional year of education increases the
monthly earnings of the self-employed by 1–5 percent, those of informal wage-
workers by 4–6 percent, and those of formal wageworkers by 7–10 percent (see
figure 7.2 and appendix E).
   Earnings differentials are a typical feature of labor market segmentation. More
specifically, an earnings gap between informal sector workers and equally quali-
fied formal wage and salaried employees can be interpreted as a measure of
the degree of labor market segmentation (Schultz 1961; Becker 1962; and
Mincer 1962). In countries such as Ghana, the formal economy is not capable of

providing enough good, high-wage jobs. The majority of self-employment con-
sists of informal income-earning activities and small businesses pursued by indi-
viduals who are unable to secure (formal) wage employment.
    The key to accessing the formal wage sector is once again education
(figure 7.3). About 44 percent of workers employed in the formal sector have
a tertiary education and 32 percent have graduated from SHS, whereas
only 24 percent have a JHS education or less. In Ghana the formal sector
mainly consists of high-value-added service companies, which require a highly
qualified labor force.
    Only tertiary education has a significant premium in the formal sector given
the selection bias. This means, for example, that individuals with higher ability
and motivation are more likely to choose and complete tertiary education and
receive higher earnings. Graduates of SHS and JHS and those who have com-
pleted primary education all have the same probability as workers with no for-
mal education of being self-employed (figure 7.4). Furthermore, self-employed
workers use their numeracy skills more intensively than all other employees
and perform fewer repetitive tasks and use the computer less. With respect to
socioemotional skills, only grit is positively correlated with being self-employed
(see appendix E).

                       Returns to Education: Is There a Gender Premium?
                       The returns to an additional year of education are very similar—between 3 and
                       5 percent for men and between 3 and 6 percent for women (figure 7.5). The
                       returns to primary education are not significantly different from zero for both
                       men and women. For males only tertiary education guarantees a premium,
                       whereas for women education starts to pay off starting from JHS.
                          The market reward is always higher for women than for men. In fact, after
                       controlling for all skills, the returns to tertiary education are 98 percent for
                       females and 73 percent for men. This gender gap might be misleading because it
                       does not take into account that both labor market participation and educational
                       attainments are lower for women.

      Notes
      	 1.	We recognize the possible limitations of this estimation procedure in terms of possible
           multi-collinearity. Furthermore, a causal interpretation of the finding shown in the
           following sections is not either legitimate or claimed.
      	 2.	This is consistent with recent studies for many low-income countries showing that
           the returns to primary education are lower than those for the secondary level—see
           Mwabu and Schultz (2000) for South Africa, Kingdon (1997) for India, Siphambe
           (2000) for Botswana, among others. For example, Moll (1996) argues that a decline in
           school quality and changes in demand and supply factors largely account for the low
           returns to primary schooling in South Africa.

Mismatch of Skills: A Measurement
Issue and Unexploited Potential
at Work




Mismatch between Self-Reported Skills and Core
Literacy Test Results: Does Language Matter?
Several of the cognitive and job-specific skills captured in the Skills Toward
Employment and Productivity (STEP) survey are self-reported. These self-
reported measures relate to the intensity of use of these skills at work or outside
work. The self-reported reading skill measure can capture a subjective assessment
of the mastery and usefulness of the skill, but a key question is how well these
assessments fit in with some objective measures such as the Core Literacy Test.
If subjective and objective measures reflected a real ability, those reporting that
they read frequently should also be able to pass the Core test. However, although
69 percent of adults reported reading regularly, only 42 percent of the population
passed the Core test.
    This considerable mismatch is due to both the high nonresponse rate for the
objective literacy assessment (in contrast to low missing values for the subjective
measurements) and the difficulties encountered in the Core test because of the
language used. As a consequence, the Core test is more likely to be a measure of
the individual’s English literacy than of his or her general reading skills. Notably,
the self-reported assessment of the use of skills does not specify a particular lan-
guage, and respondents might indeed take it to mean any of the local languages
widely used not only in the rural Ghana but also in urban areas.
    There is a considerable mismatch between the self-reported and the assessed
reading skills (that is, between those reporting that they read and those passing
the Core test). Indeed, about 26 percent of those who reported reading did not
pass the Core test. Still, those not passing the Core test and reporting reading are
41 percentage points more likely to speak English at work (74 percent use
English at work whereas 33 percent do not) and slightly more likely to speak
English at home (close to 2 percentage points).

          The mismatch between self-reported and measured literacy is not randomly
      distributed (see appendix F). Those who failed the Core test and reported
      being able to read are more likely to be women, to be less educated, to work
      in low-skilled occupations and less in high-value-added sectors, and to earn
      about 41 percent less than those who report being able to read and also pass
      the Core test.
          The difference in the intensity of use of reading skills might definitively
      explain the skills mismatch between self-reported and objective measures of
      skills. The intensity of use of the skill is a more closely related measure to the
      Core test. Among those who self-reported reading with low intensity, 66 percent
      failed the text and 30 percent passed it. Only 14 percent of those who failed
      indicated reading frequently.


      Are There Unexploited Skills in the Workforce?
      Among the employed population, a group of individuals reported using their
      cognitive skills and computer skills in their daily life (that is, using skills out-
      side the realm of a paid job, including a family business) but not at work. This
      group of people might represent unexploited human capital that the labor
      market is not able to absorb. In this section, we analyze the profile of those
      who report using their skills only outside work and those who use their skills
      at work.
         Women—more frequently than men—are likely to be literate but employed
      in occupations not requiring the use of reading and writing skills. Similarly, there
      is an unexploited potential among the youngest generations who are able to
      use computers but work in jobs where this skill is not demanded. Being able to
      use their computer skills at work would guarantee them a monthly income
      38 percent higher than they receive in their current occupations.
         Those using a skill only at home are less likely to work at a high-skilled
      occupation and in a high-value-added sector and are more likely to work at
      a mid-skilled occupation and a low- to mid-value-added sector. The greatest
      unexploited potential, as expected, is among those in low-skilled occupa-
      tions and low-value-added sectors. For example, about 34 percent of the
      self-employed read at home but never use their reading skills at work.
      Conversely, only 6 percent of employees in the formal sector have a skills
      mismatch.
         The level of education seems to be closely related to the use of certain skills
      at work. The level of education of those who read, write, or use computers only
      at home is lower than for those using their skills at work. The latter are predomi-
      nantly senior high school (SHS) graduates. The fact that the mismatch of skills
      occurs more at lower levels of education than SHS might suggest that SHS pro-
      vides students with the right skills demanded by the labor market and that SHS
      education provides a clear signal to employers of the cognitive skills potential
      employees have.

Mismatch of Skills: A Measurement Issue and Unexploited Potential at Work 	              79


    To a certain extent the mismatch of skills used at home but remaining unused
at work does reflect the quality of those skills rather than an unexploited potential.
Indeed, on average those using their (reading, writing, and computer) skills only at
home performed worse on both the Reading Component and the Core test than
those who also use them at work.
    To sum up, there is a clear connection between the availability of skills and the
use of skills at work, whether the skills are cognitive or work related. Moreover, the
use of the skills at work appears to explain the difference between objectively
measured and self-reported skills. Those who work in low-skilled occupations
are more likely to report higher skills than are measured objectively through the
literacy assessment.


Conclusions and Looking Forward
In conclusion, the study has provided evidence in a number of areas that are
relevant for policy makers, for setting government investment priorities and also
for continued diagnostic work. The study demonstrated the positive impact of
early childhood education on schooling, on jobs, and on earnings. The country
continues to demonstrate progress in education attainment at all levels, but there
is also evidence of persistent disparities in attainment by income, gender, and
geographical location. There are also continued difficulties with delayed educa-
tion, dropout, and low completion rate—mostly for the poor, given the high
opportunity costs. Importantly, improved education attainment did not bring
about comparable improvements in cognitive skills as measured by the adult
literacy assessment.
    The labor market also shows persistent segregation between employment in
higher-value sectors, where employees have higher attainment and education
pays off, and employment in sectors such as agriculture, fishing, and mining,
where there appears to be an equilibrium of low education and low income. In
the first group, employees demonstrate and report higher skills. There is a clear
connection between the availability of skills and the use of skills at work,
whether the skills are cognitive or work related. Moreover, the use of the skills
at work appears to explain the difference between objectively measured and
self-reported skills. Those who work in low-skilled occupations are more likely
to report higher skills than are measured objectively through the literacy
assessment.
    These findings offer some priorities and options for policy and investment. For
the country, investment and scaled-up access and quality in early childhood edu-
cation would lead to sustained long-term growth and shared prosperity. For
education policy, continued investment into improved literacy and also improved
socioemotional and work skills helps build the country’s human capital (increas-
ing demand for postbasic, postsecondary education) and improved labor force.
Sustainable forms of skills development should incentivize demand and supply
of skills through both formal and on-the-job training.

         The study also offers options for continued diagnostic work. The household
      survey data could help carry out more in depth analysis on the return to educa-
      tion and skills (and the role of training), on skills formation (and how cognitive
      and noncognitive skills correlate), and cross-countries comparison with other
      similar datasets. Finally, this research could be complemented with a STEP
      employer survey that focuses on the demand for education and both cognitive
      and noncognitive skills by both public and private employers in Ghana’s key
      economic sectors.

      Specific On-the-Job Skills Survey Questions
      Computer use
      “As a part of your work do you (did you) use a computer?”
         “As a part of your life [outside of work as (OCCUPATION)] have you used a
      computer in the past 3 months?”

      External interpersonal skills
      “As part of this work, do you (did you) have any contact with people other than
      co-workers, for example with customers, clients, students, or the public?”
         Using any number from 1 to 10, where 1 is little involvement (…) and 10
      means much of the work involves meeting or interacting (…) what number
      would you use to rate this work?

      Physical tasks
      “Using any number from 1 to 10 where 1 is not at all physically demanding (such
      as sitting at a desk answering a telephone) and 10 is extremely physically
      demanding (such as carrying heavy loads, construction worker, etc), what num-
      ber would you use to rate how physically demanding your work is?”


                  Aggregation                                          Intensity of use    Level

      Cognitive challenge: average of two indicators
      “Some tasks are pretty easy and can be done right away or after getting a little
      help from others. Other tasks require more thinking to figure out how they
      should be done. As part of this work as [OCCUPATION], how often do you
      have to undertake tasks that require at least 30 minutes of thinking?”

Job learning time: based on three questions
“What minimum level of formal education do you think would be required
before someone would be able to carry out this work?
   How many years of work experience in other related work do you think
would be required before someone with [FILL Q22] would be able to carry out
this work?
   About how long would it take someone to learn to do this work well if they
had [FILL Q22] education and [FILL Q23] years of related work experience?”

Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint.
In support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and
print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide.
Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances
decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas
emissions, and waste.
   We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled
content. The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached
­
using totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), or enhanced
elemental chlorine–free (EECF) processes.
   More information about the Bank’s environmental philosophy can be found

               Stepping Up Skills in Urban Ghana  •  http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-1012-1
The Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) survey is an initiative of the World Bank in cooperation
with other development partners and nongovernmental agencies. STEP was carried out in more than
14 countries globally. In Ghana, the first phase of the survey, focusing on adults in urban communities, was
undertaken in partnership with the University of Ghana’s Institute of Statistical, Social, and Economic Research;
the Ministry of Education; the Council for Technical and Vocational Education and Training; and the Ghana
Statistical Service.

Stepping Up Skills in Urban Ghana provides detailed insights from the survey for policy makers. These insights
cover areas including investments in early childhood education, the role of improvements in the quality of
education, and the creation of incentives for economic actors to invest in on-the-job training to improve
Ghana’s competitiveness and the well-being of its citizens.
