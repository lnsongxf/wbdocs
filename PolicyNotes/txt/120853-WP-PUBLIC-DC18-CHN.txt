About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      BuildCo will request a soil test for the structural calculations for the

      For the warehouse, as described in the case study, the standard penetration
      test is what would most likely be done, which is a simpli ed procedure for
      this type of study, since the warehouse is not a very complex project. Soil
      testing helps to determine the properties of the soil, which can vary from
      place to place. The soil investigation helps to determine the bearing capacity
      of the land, which in turn helps to determine the load capability, the type and
      depth of foundation, in order to make sure to select a suitable construction
      technique.

       Agency : Authorized Supervision Agency

       BuildCo must hire a supervision agency to supervise and ensure the quality
       and safety of the construction.

       There is no uniform price for hiring a supervisor. The cost should be
       calculated as follows:
       1. Designing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project design is less than
       CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is calculated as 0.44 % (1,279,322 x 0.44%= CNY
       5,629) of the budgetary estimate of the project design.
       2. Building and repairing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project
       building and repairing is less than CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is calculated as
       3.3% (1,279,322 x 3.3% = CNY 42,217.6) of the budgetary estimate. The new
       value is CNY 42,217.6 + CNY 5,629 = CNY 47,846.6. Additionally builders need
       to pay CNY 78,036.00 (CNY 60.00 per square meter) for designs to be
       presented to the People's Civil Defense o ce.

       These calculations are according to the Notice on the Standard of Industry-
       Directed Price for the Construction Supervision Agency Fees of Shanghai’ (Hu
       Jiang Jiang Xiezi [2001], No. 20, e ective January 1, 2002).

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Private ownership of land is not permitted in China; all land is subject to
      either State ownership or collective ownership. However, a private party is
      entitled to obtain the right to use the land. Regarding the State-owned land,
      there are two types of land use rights, the “granted land use right” and the
      “allocated land use right”. The di erence is that the granted land use right is
      limited in time against payment, whereas the allocated land use right is
      usually given for free with no time limit, but for speci c purposes only. A
      private party also may transfer to another private party the granted land use
      right. The allocated land use right cannot be commercially transferable
      before being converted into granted land use right. In this case, the land is
      used for commercial purposes. Usually land for commercial use is owned by
      the State, and the relevant land use right is the State-owned land use right.
      As to the term of the land use right in this case the buyer, who will use the                                     Page 51

       before being converted into granted land use right. In this case, the land is
      Business
Doing used        2018 China
           for commercial purposes. Usually land for commercial use is owned by
       the State, and the relevant land use right is the State-owned land use right.
       As to the term of the land use right in this case the buyer, who will use the
       land for commercial purposes, will only get 40 years as the initial term (as
       maximum unless it extends the granted land use rights at the end of the 40
       year period by paying to the State the additional land price) minus the
       period from the granting date from the State to the date of the transfer to
       ABC. If the land is zoned for industrial use or warehousing use rather than
       for commercial use, the maximum land tenure should be 50 years.

       There is a standard form sale and purchase agreement formulated by
       government authorities and is required to be used in practice. The contents
       of the standard form agreement may be revised or supplemented by way of
       a supplemental agreement attached to the standard form agreement as
       appendix. The sale and purchase agreement needs to be printed at
       designated printers. Such printers are only available at licensed real estate
       brokers and the property registry o ces. Property Ownership Certi cate
       and Land Use Right Certi cate are combined into one certi cate in Shanghai,
       which is called "Real Estate Title Certi cate".
       The documentation shall include:
       The seller and the buyer should submit one original real estate sales and
       purchase contract (duly signed) and a writing representation of the seller
       and buyer regarding the title transfer. There is no standard form of the
       contract (except for newly constructed commercial residential properties)
       nor is the participation of a lawyer/notary required.

       Private ownership of land is not permitted in China; all land is subject to
       either State ownership or collective ownership. However, a private party is
       entitled to obtain the right to use the land. Regarding the State-owned land,
       there are two types of land use rights, the “granted land use right” and the
       “allocated land use right”. The di erence is that the granted land use right is
       limited in time against payment, whereas the allocated land use right is
       usually given for free with no time limit, but for speci c purposes only. A
       private party also may transfer to another private party the granted land use
       right. The allocated land use right cannot be commercially transferable
       before being converted into granted land use right.



       In this case, the land is used for commercial purposes. Usually land for
       commercial use is owned by the State, and the relevant land use right is the
       State-owned land use right. As to the term of the land use right in this case
       the buyer, who will use the land for commercial purposes, will only get 40
       years as the initial term (as maximum unless it extends the granted land use
       rights at the end of the 40 year period by paying to the State the additional
       land price) minus the period from the granting date from the State to the
       date of the transfer to ABC. If the land is zoned for industrial use or
       warehousing use rather than for commercial use, the maximum land tenure
       should be 50 years.

                                                       (BizBank) are used:

                                                       - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                       - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                       - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                       The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                       loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                       of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                       to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                       property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                       a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                       In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the              - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                          and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

  Case management (0-6)                                      - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                     - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator          Answer              Explanation

Proceeding         liquidation         Mirage initiates reorganization pursuant to art. 70 of the Enterprise Insolvency Law after the
                   (after an           default on payment. If the business operations and financial position continue to deteriorate
                   attempt at          and there is no hope of revival, upon request by BizBank, the court shall rule that the
                   reorganization)     reorganization procedure should be terminated and shall declare the debtor bankrupt and
                                       convert into liquidation proceeding. During the liquidation proceeding, the Court will
                                       appoint a bankruptcy administrator who will hold creditor's meeting, finalize the list of
                                       creditors' claims and draft a distribution plan. Once the distribution plan gets approved by
                                       the Court, Mirage's assets will be sold piecemeal in a public auction and the sale proceeds
                                       will be paid to BizBank.

Outcome            piecemeal sale      No, the hotel will stop operating and Mirage assets will be sold piecemeal in a public auction,
                                       conducted by the insolvency administrator appointed by the Court, as a result of liquidation
                                       proceedings.

Time (in years)    1.7                 A reorganization procedure that is then converted into liquidation will approximately take
                                       1.67 years in total. According to the PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy law, the reorganization plan
                                       must be approved by the creditors within 180 days from commencement of reorganization
                                       proceedings (this is the maximum period for which the individual actions are stayed). In
                                       practice, it will takes about 8 months to prepare the creditors list, draft and vote the plan,
                                       which would be rejected under our case study assumptions. The case will then be converted
                                       into liquidation, taking the formal conversion and the organization and execution of the sale
                                       1 additional year (until the proceeds of the sale are finally distributed among creditors).

Cost (% of         22.0                The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 22% of the value of the
estate)                                debtor's estate (CNY 3,500,688). The total cost include the court fees (0.5%), attorney's fees
                                       (5%-10%), cost of notification and publication (1%), insolvency representative fees (5-
                                       10%),fees of accountants, assessors, inspectors and other professionals (7%), fees of
                                       auctioneers (1-5%), and fees of service providers and/or government levies (5%).

Indicator         Answer              Explanation

Proceeding        liquidation         Mirage initiates reorganization pursuant to art. 70 of the Enterprise Insolvency Law after the
                  (after an           default on payment. However, in accordance with article 75, during the restructuring period,
                  attempt at          the exercise of the security rights enjoyed over specific property of the debtor shall be
                  reorganization)     suspended. So, the reorganization plan will not be approved by BizBank since its security
                                      right will be affected the most during the reorganization. Such disapproval by BizBank will
                                      lead to the termination of the reorganization procedure by the court. The court will declare
                                      Mirage bankrupt and convert the reorganization into liquidation proceedings. During the
                                      liquidation proceeding, the Court will appoint a bankruptcy administrator who will hold
                                      creditor's meeting, finalize the list of creditors' claims and draft a distribution plan. Once the
                                      distribution plan gets approved by the Court, Mirage's assets will be sold piecemeal in a
                                      public auction and the sale proceeds will be paid to BizBank.

Outcome           piecemeal sale      No, the hotel will stop operating and Mirage assets will be sold piecemeal in a public auction,
                                      conducted by the insolvency administrator appointed by the Court, as a result of liquidation
                                      proceedings.

Time (in years)   1.7                 A reorganization procedure that is then converted into liquidation will approximately take 20
                                      months in total. The court shall rule on whether or not to accept the petition within 15 days
                                      from the date of receipt of the petition. In case the court accepts the petition, it shall serve
                                      its ruling on the petitioner within five days and notify the known creditors within 25 days
                                      from the date of ruling to accept the bankruptcy petition and make an announcement.
                                      (Article 10-14, Enterprise Insolvency Law). The reorganization plan must be approved by the
                                      creditors within 180 days from commencement of reorganization proceedings (this is the
                                      maximum period for which the individual actions are stayed) (art. 79, Enterprise Insolvency
                                      Law). In practice, it will takes about 8 months to prepare the creditors list, draft and vote the
                                      plan, which would be rejected under our case study assumptions. The case will then be
                                      converted into liquidation, taking the formal conversion and the organization and execution
                                      of the sale 1 additional year (until the proceeds of the sale are finally distributed among
                                      creditors).

Cost (% of        22.0                The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 22% of the value of the
estate)                               Mirage's estate. The total cost include the court fees (0.5%), attorney's fee (5%-10%), cost of
                                      notification and publication (1%), insolvency representative fees (5%-10%), fees of
                                      accountant, assessors, inspector and other professionals (7%), fees of auctioneers (1%-5%),
                                      and fees of service providers and/or government levies (5%).
