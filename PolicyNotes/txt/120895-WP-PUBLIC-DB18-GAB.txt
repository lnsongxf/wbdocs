About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : City Hall (Mairie)

      Once BuildCo is ready to submit its building permit application, it must go to
      City Hall (Mairie) to purchase 2 municipal stamps (timbres scaux). These
      stamps cost FCFA 1,000.00 each and will be used to legalize the building
      permit.

      du Cadastre (ANUTTC)

      BuildCo must request the building permit at the Agence Nationale de
      l’Urbanisme. First the application form must be bought. When applying, the
      following documents must be provided: 5 copies of the building plan, one
      copy of the title, and other documents depending on the usage, the
      complexity and location of the project ( re report, plans safety and re, soil
      studies, studies of environmental impact review of civil aviation etc.).

      The application must include either a land title or a provisional decree, a
      certi cate from the Directorate of Taxes which certi es that the company is
      currently in the process of obtaining a land title, with single copies of
      cadaster enough that a nal deed of sale.

      The examination of the le is FCFA 50,000. Once the request has been
      approved, the le is transmitted to the City Hall for further examination.
      There is a site visit by the City Hall and the nal approval is given. The cost is
      FCFA 50 000

  5   Obtain the building permit from City Hall                                               30 days                      XAF 50,000

      The building permit application is reviewed by a committee of the building
      which includes 14 representatives and is chaired by the mayor. The
      Commission meets every Wednesday and usually works on 10 les each
      time. On average, the Commission received 15 applications a week. So if
      BuildCo submits an application on a Monday and among the rst 10
      applicants, the application will be considered during that week. Otherwise,
      the application will be discussed the following week. BuildCo can therefore
      provide between 3 and 10 days to see its application approved by the
      Commission. The Commission will verify, among other things, that the plans
      have been designed by an architect who is either a member of the Order of                                                            Page 13

      have been designed by an architect who is either a member of the Order of
      Architects of Gabon and is a graduate of one of the leading universities in
      the region. If the request is approved, the Head of Department will send a
      "be transmitted" to the cadastre asking him to conduct an inspection
      (implantation). The topographer will visit the proposed site for the
      construction and mark the location of the building on the lot to ensure that
      the plans conform to the plan of the lot (boundary plan) that was submitted.
      If the service manager sends the "be sent" a Thursday, it usually happens on
      Friday. The Cadastre will then send a bill for the establishment to the
      applicant. Zoning is one of the stages of the Commission's evaluation
      process that takes more time. There is no separate zoning process, but
      applicants must indicate in their application the usage of the building:
      residential, commercial or industrial purposes, and must verify that this is
      consistent with the zoning map Planning the city.

      an invoice for the supervision of the works. Once the bill is paid, the
      contractor retained by the customer transmits to SEEG the plan for external
      works. After agreement by SEEG on the plan for external works, the
      contractor signs a certi cate of non-commencement of work and lodges a
      request to picket to SEEG. The subcontractor then performs the work,
      equips the transformer substation, carries out the opening of the trench
      and rehabilitates the road.

                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding          liquidation         As Mirage will not be able to settle its current liabilities with its available assets, it will file a
                    (after an           declaration of cessation of payments (article 25 of the Uniform Act Organizing Collective

                    reorganization)     the opening of reorganization proceedings and avoid liquidation. Under article 27, a
                                        composition proposal is a proposal lodged no later than 15 days following the declaration of
                                        cessation of payments, specifying the measures and conditions envisaged to redress the
                                        company. According to our information, Mirage will not reach an agreement with its
                                        creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court will convert the
                                        proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of the proposal (article 33 of the
                                        Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that is later converted into liquidation is the most
                                        likely proceeding in Gabon.

Outcome             piecemeal sale      At the end of liquidation proceedings, the hotel will stop operating and the assets of Mirage
                                        will be sold separately.

Time (in years)     5.0                 Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of
                                        reorganization proceedings. The declaration has to be done 30 days following the cessation
                                        of payments. The competent court will then declare cessation of payments and open
                                        reorganization proceedings. The composition proposal will fail after 30 months of
                                        negotiations, so the proceedings will be converted to liquidation, which would take 24
                                        months. According to our estimations, the complete process with all additional steps of a
                                        reorganization attempt that is then converted to liquidation and the sale of assets takes
                                        approximately 60 months.

Cost (% of          14.5                According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted into
estate)                                 liquidation costs approximately XAF 62,000,000 (14.5% of the value of the estate). Lawyer fees
                                        (10%), fees of official receiver and receivers (3%), and bailiffs and assignees (2%) appointed
                                        under articles 39, 41 and 48 are the main cost components.
