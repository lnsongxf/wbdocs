About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Agency : National Social Security Fund

        This procedure has two functions: “Registration” of a new employee and
        “Con rmation” by the system.

        The “Registration” function entails submitting a le for each new employee at
        the NSSF regional o ce closest to the company premises and obtaining a le
        reference number (or a receipt acknowledging the registration) immediately
        upon the submission. Once this “Registration” function is completed, the
        business is considered to have ful lled its legal obligations with the NSSF.

        become immediately e ective. The Time to complete this procedure is 1 day

        (printed on a special size sheet) in the name of the registered employee
        along with his/her unique NSSF ID. Due to the lack of printing equipment at
        NSSF, the con rmation documents are printed in batches every few days or
        so. Therefore, it could take up to 30 days for a con rmation sheet to be
        received by the newly registered employee.

       The Urban Development Department inspects the property and the plans to
       ensure that they are consistent with the construction laws and regulations,
       and then issues its clearance for the issuance of the building permit and
       calculates the building permit taxes. The inspection itself is completed in a
       day, but it takes a while from the date BuildCo requests the inspection until
       the date the inspector arrives.

       Agency : Municipality

       The Urban Development Department refers the le to the relevant
       municipality (in the case of the city of Beirut, to the Administrator of the City
       of Beirut). The municipality collects the construction permit taxes and issues
       the construction permit in the name of the property owner. Payment is
       made at the municipality.

       According to Decree No. 60 of 1988 on Municipal Taxes, the building permit
       taxes paid to the Municipality are a certain value per square meter of the
       building. However, this value per square meter is calculated based on the
       value of 1 square meter of construction as follows:

       - From the value of LBP 1 - 25,000: 1.5% of the construction value of 1 square
       meter
       - From the value between LBP 25,000 - 100,000: 2% of the construction value
       of 1 square meter
       - From the value greater than LBP 100,000: 1% of the construction value of 1
       square meter


       In the case of Doing Business, the value of 1 square meter of construction is
       the total construction value / 1,300.6 sq. m.

       Therefore, the value per square meter without taxes to be paid is calculated
       as follows: (1.5% * 25,000) + (2% * 75,000) + (1% * [total construction value -
       100,000]).


       Then a 15% municipal tax is added to the value above + 0.05% of the
       construction value of 1 square meter to obtain the total value to be paid per
       sq. m. as a municipal contribution.


       A second tax of 12% of the value above must be paid per square meter as a
       national tax.

       A contribution of 5% of the value above must be paid per square meter to
       the Order of Engineers and Architects.


       Therefore, the above values would all be added to obtain the total cost per
       square meter paid to the municipality for all building permit fees, which is
       then multiplied by 1,300.6 sq. m. for the purposes of the Doing Business case
       study.

       Agency : Municipality

       By law, construction work can start if no decision about the building permit
       application has been made 15 days after the submission date. In practice,
       however, this is not applied, and people wait 4 months on average.

       To start construction the engineer and/or architect must pay the dossier fee
       according to the number of professionals involved in the construction work

       With follow-up, it takes 10 days from the time an inspection is requested
       until an inspection begins. Without follow-up, however, the inspection might
       never take place.

       Once construction has been completed, an application for approval of an
       occupancy permit must be submitted to the Urban Development
       Department. The Urban Development Department performs an on-site
       inspection of the building to ensure that it is in compliance with the
       construction permit and approved plans.


       The application for an occupancy permit must be accompanied by the plans
       related to the completed construction, signed by the engineer in charge, and

       Development Department, the le is forwarded to the relevant municipality
       (in the case of Beirut, to the Administrator of the City of Beirut) that will issue
       the occupancy permit in the name of the property owner. According to the
       law, the occupancy permit must be issued within a month. However, this
       time limit is not enforced in practice.

      The customer submits an application for electricity connection at Electricité
      du Liban’s o ces.
      In addition to the application form, the client needs to submit:
      • copy of the title deed
      • copy of the ID card
      • the original building permit, and
      • electricity bill from the closest building (or meter box number) and its

      Agency : Electricité du Liban (EDL), Beirut

      The application is forwarded to the relevant department at the utility for
      review. A site inspection is usually carried out to determine the details of the
      connection.

      The inspector then prepares a report with the speci cs of the connection
      and awaits clearance from the relevant authority at the utility.

      Once clearance is obtained and the inspector has prepared an estimate of
      the connection fees, the client will need to make the necessary payment at
      Electricité du Liban’s o ces. The client is then given the approved le back
      along with a “C23” card (with the number of connections and the temporary
      meter, if needed).

      External works start after the client has paid the connection fees. For a
      connection of 3x200A, if the warehouse is less than 200 meters away from
      the closest distribution substation, the works will consist of laying out an
      underground cable from the building to that substation.

      Otherwise, a substation would be needed.


      Any permits needed for the works are obtained by the utility directly.

      The utility picks a contractor to do the external works, and possibly install
      the meter and turn the electricity on too. The utility however, always
      supervises the works.
      The contractor is in charge of applying for any required excavation permit
      with the municipality.                                                                                                             Page 23

       Usually it is the utility that turns on electricity, but it all depends on the
       agreement between the contractor and the utility. The contractor might
       have the right to also turn on the electricity.


       At times when the utility is overloaded, it normally delegates the works
       entirely to its contractor that does the works, installs the meter, and turns

      The participation of a lawyer is not mandatory, but it is preferred to avoid
      any mistakes. The sale contract is often drafted by the notary public or by a
      quali ed facilitator.
      However, for complex and delicate real estate transactions where either or
      both parties need to protect their rights, the contract is usually negotiated
      and drafted by both parties’ attorneys.
      The Beirut Bar Association on its decision of April 26th, 2012 has set a
      minimum fee of LBP 1,500,000 for the drafting of a contract. Such minimum
      fee shall be subject to an increase taking into consideration the contract's

                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer             Explanation

Proceeding           foreclosure       BizBank will initiate foreclosure proceedings (saisie exécutoire), because it is faster and less
                                       costly than liquidation proceedings and allows BizBank to obtain the totality of its dues
                                       independently of other debtors. If Mirage management or other creditors commence
                                       insolvency proceedings, BizBank's enforcement claim will not be affected, except that a
                                       syndic may be appointed, who will represent the debtor in foreclosure proceedings.

Outcome              piecemeal sale    The hotel is not likely to continue operating at the end of the foreclosure proceedings as the
                                       assets will be sold during BizBank's enforcement proceedings.

Time (in years)      3.0               BizBank will file for "saisie exécutoire", which normally involves a simple enforcement of
                                       security right without review of the merits. However, it is likely that hotel management will
                                       try to dispute the validity of BizBank's security, which means that the proceedings will
                                       become more complex and will take longer than straightforward enforcement proceedings.
                                       After disputes over the validity of the debt are settled, the court will issue an execution
                                       order, which will be enforced by court clerks (huissiers), who will seize and attach the assets
                                       secured by the loan agreement. Prior to selling the assets in a public auction, the public
                                       auction is published in newspapers.

Cost (% of           15.0              Main expenses will include attorneys' fees (5-10%) and court fees, including the cost of
estate)                                publication and notification (4-7%), as well as other smaller expenses, including fees of other
                                       professionals that may be involved in the foreclosure proceedings, such as accountants.
