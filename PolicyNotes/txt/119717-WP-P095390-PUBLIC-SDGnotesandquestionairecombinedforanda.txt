       Land Tenure Module – Essential questions for data collection for 1.4.2 & 5.a.1
                                           September 13, 2017


The attached questionnaire module was designed jointly by FAO, UN Habitat, and The World Bank, as
custodians, with input from GLII, GLDW and Landesa. It is intended to collect the essential data required
for computation of SDG 1.4.2 and 5.a.1. The tool, which aims to address all needs of both indicators,
includes only the truly essential questions for these SDGs.

The module may be expanded by NSOs or other agencies. Additionally, examples of a longer land tenure
module, which also include these essential questions. An expanded module will be designed and shared in
a guidebook by the World Bank.

The module attached is one version of the essential module. This assumes proxy respondents and a full
parcel roster. As will be discussed below, additional versions will be designed for individual-level data
collection efforts and for other types of household surveys with proxy respondents that are not parcel
based (such as consumption/ expenditure, housing surveys etc.).


Integration of the module in surveys and necessary customization by NSO

The focus of this module is on essential questions for SDGs 5.a.1 and 1.4.2 only. Data collection for these
SDGs will generally be completed by adding a coherent land module with the essential questions to
already planned surveys by NSO. Some customization of the module will be necessary. The following
points should be considered:

•   Some questions require customization of response codes, depending on the country context. Refer to
    the notes on row 5 in module attached. A methodological note on customization will be made
    available.
•   The NSO may decide to include a few questions that do not seem directly relevant for the SDGs as
    such, but that necessary for analysis of access to land and land tenure security at the country level
    (parcel area, for example).
•   Proxy versus direct respondent:
        o All agencies agreed that collecting self-reported data is desirable to improve quality of data
             collection on all topics (not just land) for vulnerable groups (age, gender, non-sedentary
             population etc.) who normally are not interviewed in a standard data collection approach with
             one respondent by household, but currently this is often not possible for NSOs due to cost and
             capacity constraints. It was agreed that a concerted effort is needed together with custodians
             of other SDGs (and policy makers) while providing evidence on the quality increase in data,
             cost implications and mitigation approaches. This may be an issue to put on the agenda of the
             next IAEG-SDG.
        o A version of the essential module will also be prepared in a format for individual-level data
             collection.
•   NSO can expand the questions, like will be the case in an LSMS setting. Recommended full modules,
    including but not limited to the questions in the essential short version, will be proposed in a
    Guidebook put out by the World Bank LSMS team (see below). FAO and UN Habitat are preparing
    capacity building tools.
•   In contexts where customary land tenure is common, it may be necessary to include questions on land
    tenure at the community level (i.e., in a community-level questionnaire).
•   Recognizing that there are a number of potential survey objectives and questionnaire structures in
    which the land tenure and 1.4.2 / 5.a.1 questions may be integrated, multiple versions of the module
    will be made available. A decision tree (see page 4) is used to organize the various versions, with
    decision nodes at (i) whether one is interested in agricultural land, non-agricultural land, or both, (ii)
    whether individual-level data collection is possible, and (iii) if the questionnaire includes a detailed
    agricultural module.1 The idea is however for the key questions to remain unaltered so as to promote
    comparability of data and harmonization of indicators. The proposed versions include:

         o   1: Agricultural & Non-Agricultural land, no agriculture module (5.a.1 & 1.4.2)
                 ▪ 1A – Proxy respondents (module attached)
                 ▪ 1B – Individual-level data collection
         o   2: Agricultural & Non-Agricultural land, with detailed agriculture module (5.a.1 & 1.4.2)
                 ▪ 2A – Proxy respondents
                 ▪ 2B – Individual-level data collection
         o   3: Agricultural land only
                 ▪ 3A – Proxy respondents
                 ▪ 3B – Individual-level data collection
         o   4: Non-Agricultural land only
                 ▪ 4A – Proxy respondents
                 ▪ 4B – Individual-level data collection


Training material, capacity building, country specific meta data

    •    The module will be accompanied by a training manual and guidance for enumerator training
         including an image for each document, which is particularly important for the questions on
         documentation. The manual will also provide guidance to NSO on how to establish the list of
         documents and collect images, in coordination with land agencies and other stakeholders. World
         Bank, GDWGL and GLII partners will support this process.
    •    The LSMS team is preparing a Guidebook for collecting data on land tenure in the context of
         multi-topic household surveys (essential questions + expansion). The guidebook will include a
         number of recommended questionnaire modules, tailored to meet a variety of survey objectives.
         While the land modules used in LSMS surveys will include additional questions to those required
         for computing SDG indicators 1.4.2 and 5.a.1, the aim is to ensure these indicators can be
         computed using the proposed modules.

  The existence of a detailed agricultural module determines whether agricultural parcels and non-agricultural
parcels will be asked in separate questionnaire modules and is, therefore, only relevant when the survey objectives
include analysis of both agricultural and non-agricultural land.
