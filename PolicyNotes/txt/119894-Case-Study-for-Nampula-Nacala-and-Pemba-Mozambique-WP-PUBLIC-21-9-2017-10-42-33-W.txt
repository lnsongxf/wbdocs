Key Characteristics of Aggregation Case Study
                           Nampula, Nacala, and Pemba, Mozambique
Context                   •	 Low-income country

                          •	 Aggregation covering urban areas

                          •	 Low level of water performance

Purpose                   Performance, professionalization, solidarity, economic efficiency

Scope                     Water functions and services

Scale                     •	 Administrative boundaries

                          •	 Localities covered: 3 for water

                          •	 Population covered: 396,665 inhabitants for water

                          •	 Coverage: 39% for water

                          •	 Connections: 50,874 for water

                          •	 Network length: 1,371 km for water

Process                   Voluntary

Governance                •	 Merger

                          •	 Public administration

                          •	 Decision making: almost all decisions are vested in FIPAG, which is under guardianship of the Ministry of
                           Public Services, Housing, and Water Resources

                          •	 Asset transfer: assets are the property of FIPAG

                          •	 Liability: liabilities and debts from previous operators are not taken over by aggregated utility

                          •	 Staff transfer: all staff was transferred

                          •	 No clear entry and exit rules

Outcome                   Negative: very little improvement

Findings                  Investment delayed because of political arbitration; hence, services are trapped in low-level equilibrium.
                          Aggregation has not yet delivered clear benefits.
