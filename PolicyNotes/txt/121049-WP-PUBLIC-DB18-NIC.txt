About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        requested at the Social Security Institute (INSS – Instituto Nicaraguense de
        Seguridad Social). This visit is to obtain an activation procedure of the pre-
        obtained registration at INSS, and to activate the registration the company
        must have at least one employee. The employee needs to ll a form and with
        a copy of the employee’s ID the employer can request employee’s
        registration. At the same time, the company can request access to the online
        declaration service. INSS usually gives a training to use the system, which is
        set up a couple of days after the registration of the employee is requested.

      The building permit authorizes the start of construction.


      The cost of a building permit includes a tax of 1.1% of the total market value
      of the construction. This tax must be paid in full at the start of construction
      work.


      Buildings are also subject to an inspection fee, as follows:
      -NIO 2.00 per sq. m. for areas from 101 to 200 sq. m.
      -NIO 3.00 per sq. m. for areas from 201 to 1,000 sq. m.
      -NIO 4.00 per sq. m. for areas from 1,001 sq m and above
      (in the case considered here, NIO 4.00 x 1,300.6 = NIO 5202.4).


      Therefore, 1.1%* warehouse value + 4 * sq m. = NIO 29,648.4

      The required documents are a project approval, an annual real estate tax
      (solvencia de bienes inmuebles), the registration number with ALMA (the
      business registration), a tax clearance certi cate (solvencia municipal) for
      the project owner and builder, a builder’s license granted by the Ministry of
      Transportation and Infrastructure (Ministerio de Transporte e
      Infraestructura, MTI), the builder's signature on the construction plans, bank
      guarantees, and o cial payment receipts. The building permit carries the
      same weight as a public deed.


      Inspections may occur during construction. However, these are rare due to a
      shortage of inspectors. Even if an inspection is carried out, the inspector
      would simply verify that the building permit is valid.

    Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      A tax clearance certi cate ("Solvencia Municipal") must be obtained by the
      seller from the municipality. The registered time of 1 day assumes that the
      seller is up-to-date with tax payments on the property, and that he pays a fee
      of NIO 20. If he were to wait till the next business day to obtain it, it would be
      free of charge. This certi cate is valid for one year.

      A notary public prepares the sale and purchase agreement and notarizes it
      as a public deed. The preparation of the deed is an exclusive act of the
      notary. The notary will review all past transactions from the record book on
      the Land Registry with the documents obtained above, to verify the
      ownership of the property. Additionally, he will request the (i) non-
      encumbrance certi cate; (ii) tax clearance certi cate; (iii) cadastral certi cate;
      (iv) cadastral valuation; and (v) payment receipt of the Property Transfer Tax.
      In practice, the notaries estimate their fees for this type of contract based on
      a percentage of the property value, which varies between 1.5 and 2%
      according to agreement between the parties and notary.

      Parties must obtain the Cadaster Certi cate and request a valuation from an
      inspector. In practice, the Cadaster requires a special power granted to
      notaries or any other person when the interested parties cannot realize this
      Procedure. The parties can go to the Cadaster directly, in which case they do
      not need to present a special power. The Cadaster requests to see original
      property title (of the Seller). In case a special power is needed, the costs rise
      about NIO 2,000 as the fees for the person who will go to the Cadaster, and                                                     Page 29

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for

documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding            foreclosure       As a secured creditor, the bank will face only one option: a judicial foreclosure proceeding. In
                                        Nicaragua, banks prefer the foreclosure judicial track in order to request the sale of the

                                        initiate foreclosure will be handed down by the Court and an order to set up an auction will
                                        be issued. Once the time allocated by law for appeal lapses the auction would take place and
                                        the sale of debtor’s real estate will occur. The sale in public auction shall be validated by the
                                        court.

Outcome               piecemeal sale    As a result of the foreclosure proceeding, the hotel will cease operations and its assets will
                                        be sold separately. The foreclosure will take place based on article 66 of Law No. 561.

Time (in years)       2.2               The foreclosure procedure in Nicaragua will take approximately 2.2 years until the debt is
                                        fully paid from the moment of the debtor's default until the debt is repaid to the secured
                                        creditor. It will take 1 year until the approval to initiate foreclosure is handed down by the
                                        Court including all required notifications and the debtor’s counter-claim. Henceforward, it
                                        will take 1 years for the auction to take place (including the necessary time to appoint an
                                        auctioneer, the scheduling of the auction and the sale of the real estate). There hasn’t been
                                        any improvements in the time to resolve foreclosure cases in the last 5 years.

Cost (% of            14.5              The cost for a foreclosure proceeding will amount to approximately 14.5% of the value of
estate)                                 Mirage’s estate. The main component of this expenditure would be the attorney’s fees, which
                                        would amount 8% of the value of Mirage’s estate and the auctioneer’s fees, which will
                                        amount 4%. The rest will include notification and other judicial costs (0.25%), expenses
                                        related to the auction (0.25%) and fees of other professionals (2%).
