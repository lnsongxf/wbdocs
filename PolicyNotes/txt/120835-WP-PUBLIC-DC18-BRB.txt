About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Department and receive approval
      Agency : Town & Country Planning Department

      The following documents are required for the Develop Land Permission:
      • three copies of the application reform
      • design plans
      • elevation plan
      • site plan
      • location plan
      • copy of certi cate of registration by the architect


      An approved seal/stamp of the Architect’s Registration Board must be
      a xed on all accompanying drawings. No proof of ownership needs to be
      attached. Town and Country Planning gets internal clearance from
      Department of Transport. No construction can start until this application
      gets approved, which leads to delays in construction.


      After passing the front desk, the application must be forwarded to a number
      of agencies for clearance. The Town Planning Department obtains all these
      clearances internally (since 1972): Ministry of Transport (for the road),
      Building Standard Authority, Chief Fire O cer, Coastal Zone Management
      Unit and Environment Protection Development Agency (EPD). It takes 14 -- 21
      days for the di erent agencies to provide their comments so they can
       nalize the building permit.

      After obtaining all clearances, the application is forwarded to a planning
      assistant who takes 4 weeks to write his/her report. The assistant will send
      the report to the supervisor who could either be the decision o cer or
      under the decision o cer. If the application is incomplete, the supervisor will
      request additional information. It takes the supervisor 3 weeks to put his
      assessment in the report and send it to the senior town planner to issue a
       nal decision. The building permit is 3 sheets of paper. It takes 2 weeks to
      issue the building permission from the senior town planner.

  2   Submit letter on commencement of construction                                          1 day                     BBD 100

      During the initial inspection, the inspector checks for compliance with site
      plan and drawings. All proposed works should be set out for inspection by
      an O cer of the TCDPO prior to the commencement of works. It is critical
      that all 'line marks'/irons are visible at the time of the inspection in order to
      allow for accurate measurements.

       Agency : Barbados Water Authority

       Once the construction is nalized this procedure is done, and as a result,
       along with the application, BuildCo must submit copies of the approved
       drawings and the approved application (stamped). The Barbados Water
       Authority takes 3 to 4 weeks to conduct the connection. The utility workers

                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

      Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                          practices in four areas: commencement of proceedings, management of
  concern or business assets are sold piecemeal
                                                          debtor’s assets, reorganization proceedings and creditor participation.
Recovery rate for creditors

  Measures the cents on the dollar recovered by
  secured creditors
  Outcome for the business (survival or not)
  determines the maximum value that can be
  recovered
  Official costs of the insolvency proceedings are
  deducted
  Depreciation of furniture is taken into account
  Present value of debt recovered

                                      give Mirage a 10-day notice period. In the following 3 months, the BizBank appointed receiver
                                      will do an independent review of the debenture in order to avoid any possible challenges of
                                      its invalidity by other creditors or shareholders later in the process. Receiver will also meet
                                      with the hotel’s management to understand management issues in particular. After the
                                      review period, within 5-10 days, the Receiver will file a notice at the company’s registry and
                                      the Supervisor of Insolvency Department at the Ministry of Finance, notifying that a secured
                                      creditor is enforcing its security. Then the market sale of the business usually continues for
                                      half a year. The preparation and execution of auction that follow would take an additional 1
                                      year.

Cost (% of           15.0             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 15% of the value of the
estate)                               debtor's estate. The main components of the cost would comprise receiver fee (10%) and
                                      attorney fee (5%).
