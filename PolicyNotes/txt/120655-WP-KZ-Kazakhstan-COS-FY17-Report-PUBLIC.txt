I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Kazakhstan perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
   ▪ General Issues Facing Kazakhstan
   ▪ Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
   ▪ World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
   ▪ The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
   ▪ Working with the World Bank Group
   ▪ The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Kazakhstan
   ▪ Communication and Information Sharing
   ▪ Background Information

II. Methodology
From March to May 2017, 402 stakeholders of the WBG in Kazakhstan were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a Country Opinion Survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations.
A total of 267 stakeholders participated in the survey (66% response rate). Respondents either
received the questionnaires via post, courier, or email and returned it accordingly, or completed
the questionnaire via the online survey platform Qualtrics.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (response rate was 52%, N=192). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’14 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 92).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
   ▪   For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
       respondents from NGOs/community based organizations, private foundations, and faith-
       based groups were combined in the “CSO” category; and the small number of
       respondents from the judiciary branch were included in the “Other” category. There were
       no respondents from trade unions and youth groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
    ▪   Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’14 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’17 = 6.0; weighted mean in FY’14 = 6.2)1.
    ▪   Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Kazakhstan, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Kazakhstan, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the
        country’s development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Kazakhstan
Headed in the Right Direction2
      ▪    Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
           President/Prime Minister/Minister, the office of parliamentarian, and local government
           were significantly more likely to indicate that Kazakhstan is headed in the right direction,
           while respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors on WBG-supported projects and
           the media were significantly less positive about the prospect of Kazakhstan.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Kazakhstan,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-seven
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

   ▪   Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Kazakhstan. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
           ➢ The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
           ➢ The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption; and
           ➢ The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster risk management.

   ▪   Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Kazakhstan, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
           ➢   The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
           ➢   The WBG’s effectiveness at disaster risk management;
           ➢   The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
           ➢   The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
           ➢   The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection.

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2017 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2014
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2014 COS report.

FY 2017 Number of comparable respondents = 224                 FY 2014 Number of comparable respondents = 189

By weighting, the FY 2017 and FY 2014 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the following
 TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Kazakhstan? (Choose no more than TWO)
  1    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  2    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  3    A growing middle class
  4    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  5    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
  6    Consistent economic growth
  7    More reliable social safety net
  8    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
  9    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
