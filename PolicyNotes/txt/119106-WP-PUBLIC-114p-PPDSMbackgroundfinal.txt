Precautionary
Management
of Deep Sea Minerals
PACIFIC POSSIBLE BACKGROUND PAPER NO.2.
Pacific Island countries face unique development challenges.
They are far away from major markets, often with small
populations spread across many islands and vast distances,
and are at the forefront of climate change and its impacts.
Because of this, much research has focused on the challenges
and constraints faced by Pacific Island countries, and finding
ways to respond to these.

This paper is one part of the Pacific Possible series, which
takes a positive focus, looking at genuinely transformative
opportunities that exist for Pacific Island countries over the
next 25 years and identifies the region’s biggest challenges
that require urgent action.

Realizing these opportunities will often require collaboration
not only between Pacific Island Governments, but also with
neighbouring countries on the Pacific Rim. The findings
presented in Pacific Possible will provide governments
and policy-makers with specific insights into what each
area could mean for the economy, for employment, for
government income and spending.

Executive Summary
Background and Motivation

Driven by Pacific Island countries’ (PICs) limited growth opportunities, the relatively high grade
of deep sea minerals (DSM) including rare earth elements, and technological advances, deep
sea mining has emerged as a new industry in the Pacific. The Pacific Island countries (PICs) face
unique development challenges. Their small size, distance to major markets and disperse
populations make economic growth difficult. However, increasingly, their oceans are being seen
as a resource for growth. Since as early as the 1970s exploration of the deeper sea floor has
indicated that metallic minerals could be spread across large sections of the Pacific region, leading
to a very new industry characterized as “deep sea mining”. To date, three main kinds of deep sea
minerals have been identified across the Pacific region:

Figure ES1. DSM Occurrence

•      Seafloor massive sulphides (SMS) are commonly found at depths between 350 and
5,000 meters. SMS deposits form in the deep ocean around submarine volcanic arcs, where
hydrothermal vents exhale sulphide-rich mineralizing fluids into the ocean. They contain high
concentrations of iron, copper, zinc, gold, silver, manganese, nickel and cobalt. SMS deposits
have been identified in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) waters of Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands,
Tonga and Vanuatu.



                                                                                                   7
•       Polymetallic manganese nodules (PMN) most often occur at great depths (3,500 –
6,000m). These nodules can contain manganese and limited amounts of cobalt, copper, iron,
lead, manganese, nickel, zinc, and rare earth elements. They are known to occur in the EEZs of
the Cook Islands and Kiribati, and to a lesser extent, of Niue and Tuvalu.

•       Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts (CFC) are commonly found in a range of 800-2,500m
of depth. They can contain cobalt, nickel, manganese and copper, as well as other minerals
including precious metals (platinum) and rare earth elements. They are known to occur in the
EEZs of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Niue, Palau, Samoa
and Tuvalu.

To date, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu have granted deep sea
mining exploration permits, and the Cook Islands is part-way through a minerals exploration
tender process. PNG is currently the only country in the Pacific region to have granted a license
to mine, through the Solwara 1 Project, an action that reflects PNG’s greater familiarity with
mining and systems in place for regulatory and contractual oversight. However, there are strong
challenges over this emerging industry given weak regulatory and institutional capacities and
patchy traditions of transparency and stakeholder consultation, substantial uncertainties about
the economic potential of DSM, and the limited understanding of the environmental and social
risks associated with DSM mining. This is an unusual situation for governments and industry alike,
where the underlying data used to model costs and benefits is limited to scarce observations for
which connectivity to the surrounding environment is not well understood. And, it is proposed at
great depths where regulatory monitoring is exceptionally difficult.

This report does not advocate deep sea mining; rather, it takes stock of the existing information
around deep sea mining decision making and the regulatory and institutional capacities
necessary for positive outcomes. As such, the report summarizes the knowns and unknowns,
frames the need to apply the Precautionary Approach, and identifies professional and institutional
capacity building needs.

Some Knowns, Many Unknowns

While the potential revenue for countries with deep sea minerals may be sizeable in some cases,
the costs and risks involved remain unclear. Core to understanding the economic potential of
DSM mining is to first determine the in-situ value of the mineral endowment in consideration of
prevailing markets and the technologies available to exploit them. From this endowment it is then
necessary to deduct the capital and operating costs and risk-adjusted private returns associated
with investing in the location, appraisal and exploitation of DSM deposits. Third, there is need to
consider how costs attributable to social and environmental impacts are treated, for purposes of
weighing the net private and public benefits of DSM mining, while taking into account the public
cost of environmental impacts. Moreover, a high level of uncertainty must be affixed to each of
the three factors highlighted above, to better inform the design of regulatory mechanisms
through which risks would then be allocated among private and public actors. This entire system

                                                                                                 8
of cost accounting and assignment of risks is far from fully developed, and thus informed decision
making remains very unclear.

Environmental Risks

Knowledge on the environmental risks of DSM mining is limited at best, because deep sea
ecosystems and their links with pelagic and coastal ecosystems are poorly understood, and in
the absence of any exploitation to date, there are no real-life data on how mining might
influence these ecosystems and the services they provide. Under these circumstances,
expectations on the impacts are based on modelling exercises and baseline scientific research
carried out during exploration efforts, notably for Solwara 1 in Papua New Guinea (PNG), which
the Pacific Community under the European Union DSM Project synthesized in layman terms. Of
the different stages in DSM mining, which progresses from prospecting through to exploration
and on to exploitation should the resource be commercially viable; it is the exploitation stage that
is expected to have severe and potentially permanent impact on ecosystems. Impacts of
exploitation activities on the host PIC environment are expected to be mainly in the marine
domain as most processing is envisaged to take place in other countries with established supply-
chain integration. As such, offshore ecosystem impacts from exploitation would be due to:

    (i)     Seafloor operations to remove mineralised material,
    (ii)    Operational plume and sediment resuspension at the seafloor by machines;
    (iii)   Returned seawater plume;


                                                                                                  9
    (iv)       Standard vessel operation and discharges; and
    (v)        Accidental, non-routine incidents.
The approximate annual direct footprint of seafloor operations varies significantly between
mineral types, ranging from less than 0.4km2 in the case of SMS to 100-300km2 in the case of
CRCs. The indirect impact can be large ranging from less than 10km2 in the case of SMS to 1,500
– 6,000km2 in the case of PMN. Reviewers and stakeholders have paid particular attention to
potential irreversible impacts on seafloor ecosystems from mineral removal and operational
plumes and on the marine food chain, including possibly up to economically significant tuna, from
operational, dewatering and, possibly, accidentally released toxic plumes. Disclosure of some
critical new studies on some of these topics commissioned by Nautilus, the company promoting
Solwara 1, and by the PNG government of the independent review of the Environmental Impact
Statement, which informed its decision to grant an environmental permit would help answer
some of these issues in the public’s mind.

Social Risks

Stakeholder concerns are based upon the many unknowns related to DSM mining impacts,
recognizing the many social challenges that have resulted from prior experience with terrestrial
mining globally and in some of the PICs. The concerns expressed by coastal communities and non-
governmental organizations may be grouped in five interrelated categories:




                                                                                             10
    •    Potential impact on livelihoods, especially of vulnerable groups through pollution, limited
         access to traditional fishing grounds, or reduced tourism;

    •    Weak capacity within the governments to ensure strong sector governance, leaving open
         the opportunity for inadequate revenue management and local communities not
         receiving their commensurate share of benefits which include revenues and
         compensation for damages they may incur from DSM mining projects;

    •    Limited employment and other economic opportunities due to the offshore nature of the
         mining operations and plans to process the recovered minerals in other countries;

    •    Impact on customs and spiritual associations which reflect the large role that the vast
         Pacific Ocean plays in the everyday lives of the Pacific islanders;

    •    Limited ability to express concerns and influence decision making on DSM mining
         proposals as legislation may not embed comprehensive public consultations.
Given the Risks, Apply the Precautionary Approach

Because DSM mining carries risks of causing irreversible damage to the environment and harm
to the public, it is recommended that decision making on DSM exploitation proposals follow
the Precautionary Approach. In other words, project proponents should take cost-effective
measures to minimize environmental impacts even when there is no scientific certainty on the
level and nature of the risk and the impact.1 SPC has laid out an iterative and continuous process
of five steps in applying the Precautionary Approach to DSM mining (Figure ES3). In this process,
if environmental assessment of a proposed project indicates irreversible damage (Step 1), policy
makers are to proceed to determining the level of harm that is acceptable and what level of
protection is necessary (Step 2). These questions require extensive stakeholder consultations,
analysis of benefits and cost, including of difficult-to-measure potential losses of ecosystem
services, determination of how the benefits and costs would be distributed among the different
segments of the society. The answers define possible precautionary measure applicable to the
project (Step 3). Six options ranging from ‘no development’ to ‘adaptive management’ are
available to decision makers. Next, regulators in consultation with stakeholder and in conformity
with existing laws, choose the best option, taking into account factors including capacity issues,
costs, and relative risk of each option (Step 4). Here again, cost benefit analysis has an important
role to play. Regardless of the options chosen, but especially when the project goes ahead, the
monitoring and scientific research continues to reduce uncertainties and risks (Step 5), which
leads back to the original question on the existence of plausible harm. Throughout the process,
transparency and participation of a range of stakeholders, including potentially affected
communities, is considered fundamental.

 Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration states: “In order to protect the environment, the Precautionary
Approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of
serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing
cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”

Sound economic analysis is critical for evaluating trade-offs and different options; it needs to
incorporate loss of ecosystem services, including those related to existence, cultural and
spiritual values, and take into account cumulative effects of subsequent explorations in the
general geographical area. The cost benefit analyses commission by SPC for the proposed
projects in PNG (SMS,-Solwara 1) and Cook Islands (PMN) estimated the net present values of
economic benefits at $83million (2-year project) and $494million (20-year project), respectively.
However, these estimates incorporate only few of the possible environmental and social risks and
that with methodological limitations. In particular, they reflect stakeholders’ key concerns about
possible impacts on the marine food chain, fisheries, and health of communities of accidental
spills of toxic minerals and return water due to a break in the riser, and of plumes generated by
the mining operations. The study assumed, without sound independent evidence, that
operational technology would eliminate these risks. Given the deep uncertainty around a number
of variables affecting the costs and benefits of a DSM mining project, and in particular, the risk of
damage to ecosystem services, the scenario analysis approach, rather than the conventional


                                                                                                 12
approach that makes upfront assumptions on the point values and probability distribution, should
be preferred in economic cost benefit analyses of DSM mining proposals.

Precautionary Approach as Part of Good Governance

As in terrestrial mining, public sector governance is paramount in determining the extent to
which DSM exploitation is economically, politically, socially, and environmentally viable.
Critical elements of strong sector governance include:

    •   Good management to ensure efficient and effective exploitation under strong social and
        environmental performance.
    •   Good tax design to ensure appropriate government revenue and adequate incentives for
        investors.
    •   Good revenue administration to ensure revenue is collected.
    •   Good public expenditure management to ensure volatile and temporary natural resource
        revenue translates to permanent benefits for the nation and to manage the risk that
        resource wealth poses to the wider economy.

GAP analysis points to significant regulatory and institutional weaknesses at the country level
despite recent progress. Good governance and the Precautionary Approach require strong
regulations and institutions having the technical capacity to ensure regulatory compliance and
associated monitoring and reporting. Under the SPC-EU DSM Project, SPC prepared draft policies,
laws and model frameworks to guide the economic, environmental and social regulations;
bringing greater alignment of individual country frameworks to other PICs in the region. A
number of PICs have either developed, or are in the process of developing, country-specific robust
policies and legislation; whereas technical professional capacity available within governing
institutions designated to implement these regulations is nonexistent to inadequate in most PICs
and more partially adequate in a few.

Recommendations

Cost and small population sizes will limit most individual PICs’ ability to adequately manage
DSM mining; regional cooperation would help. For any PIC considering to derive economic
benefits from DSM mining in its EEZ in a fiscally, environmentally and socially responsible manner
following the Precautionary Approach, the cost of regulatory monitoring and enforcement is high.
Meeting the demands for specialized expertise and equipment is a significant challenge for most
PICs given limited national budgets and prior experience in regulating the mining sector.
Recognizing these challenges, PICs have expressed growing interest towards formalized regional
cooperation in supporting the regulation of DSM, building on the ongoing current collaboration
under the auspices of the SPC-EU DSM Project and inspired by the existing regional cooperation
in fisheries management.




                                                                                              13
Currently, the PICs cooperate with SPC on general regulatory functions; however, PIC
governments carry out all specific project-related measures, including scoping, reviewing and
approving environmental and social assessments; selecting an appropriate Precautionary
Approach option (including possibly ‘no development’); supervising and enforcing the selected
option, and ensuring full regulatory compliance on mining. However, given their current capacity
deficiencies and available resources to improve sector governance, most PICs are not in a position
to perform most of the project-specific regulatory functions. SPC has provided technical
assistance to national regulators in some areas, specifically in regard to providing technical and
legal advice on the pros and cons of each option, while the decision of the appropriate
Precautionary Approach option rests with sovereign states.

Going forward, two modes of regional cooperation have been identified, namely one that
involves a ‘regional technical service provider” and another that is based on a “regional
regulator”. In the former scenario, the regional technical service provider would expand on SPC’s
current areas of support. Specifically, it would manage/supervise all technical activities and
provide technical advice to the national authorities on regulatory matters, such as choice of the
appropriate Precautionary Approach option, on enforcement decisions in case of transgressions
in the chosen option; however, the decision making authority on these questions would rest with
PIC national governments. In the second scenario, a regional regulatory body would not only
provide technical support to regulators, but PIC governments would also delegate to the SPC the
authority to make and implement decisions on enforcement matters and lead the process of
choosing a Precautionary Approach option. The choice will rest with the PICs and may evolve over
time.

While the establishment of a regional body, whether a technical service provider or regulator,
would be much more efficient and effective, than individual PICs building up regulatory
capacity, a critical question concerns the appropriate level and source of funding. It would seem
practical and consistent with the polluter pays principle to suggest that the regional body be
funded by companies licensed to carry out prospecting and to larger degree by companies
licensed for exploration and exploitation. The “taxing” of companies at the exploration stage
makes sense given that a large number of critical regulatory functions, including the social and
environmental assessments and decisions on the Precautionary Approach option take place
during the exploration phase.

Introduction
Since the early 1970s, exploration of the deeper sea floor has produced indications of wide-spread
metallic mineral commodities, spread across large sections of the Pacific region in association with
the “ring of fire” tectonic plates. Similar resource potential has also been indicated for offshore
eastern African countries, in South Asia along the eastern Indian continent; in the Atlantic Ocean;
and even western continental North America. What has emerged is a proposed set of mining
extraction operations that represent a very new type of industry, characterized as deep sea
minerals (DSM) mining by virtue of the great depths at which these minerals occur. By definition,
DSM occur in the deeper-water (400 – 6,000 meters) where minerals are deposited by natural
processes as iron-manganese (or ferromanganese) nodules and crusts, massive sulphide,
phosphates, and metalliferous sediments.

While DSM has been pursued to varying degrees over the last few decades, the commodity super-
cycle (circa 2005 – 2013) catalyzed new interest by financiers and mining companies to back
ventures, and this has advanced application of (pre-) commercial-scale technologies. High metallic
concentrations within these deposits have led to strong investor interest within the private and
public sector. In response to suggestions of large potential revenue streams, many nations have
granted exploration permits while regulatory and institutional capacities are weak and
environmental / social impacts are still yet to be fully understood. There are material information
gaps, for which economic / environmental / social impacts remain uncertain and that carry an

                                                                                                15
element of risk into these development schemes. This report signals a need for governments to
prepare for the inevitable arrival of seabed mining and in doing so, echoes Pacific Leaders who
adopted the Madang Guidelines in 1999 SOPAC (1999). Any government going forward with DSM
needs to have (a) a better understanding of the ecological situation including the impacts to highly
sensitive ecological areas, such as fish spawning grounds, up front so as to avoid catastrophic
ecosystem damage; (b) ensured good sector governance through strengthening of laws and
policies, regulatory and administrative capacities, revenues management and accountability of
decision makers; and (c) introduced and implemented effective environmental safeguards. That
stakeholders are concerned that impacts on livelihoods and marine biodiversity should not
overwhelm any potential economic benefits, is a required precautionary approach.

That DSM mining has unknown associated risks is a source of concern. Large-scale mining on land
has a long and mixed history of contributing towards positive development outcomes, and
resource-rich / resource-dependent nations in particular have struggled to leverage natural
resource development towards broader economic diversification and sustained growth. Resource
development undertaken today will impact a nation for generations to come, and the need for
good sector governance, strong institutions and highly skilled professionals to develop and
implement sound policies, laws and regulatory oversight is paramount to deriving lasting benefits.

While there is a common understanding that Pacific Island Countries are facing DSM exploration
and production decisions today; what role the Bank should take, in offering policy guidance and/or
technical assistance across financial management, regulatory oversight capacity and other
contractual compliance measures has not been defined. The Bank is not taking a position on DSM,
but rather recognizes that a comprehensive stock-taking of the issues will inform Pacific Island
Countries (PICs) of the information gaps that need to be addressed for informed decisions, and
institutional and professional capacities that must be built to ensure sustainable outcomes. In
assisting governments with land-based mining, the World Bank undertakes sector governance
assessments to: (a) ensure appropriate and adequate content of policies, laws and regulations to
manage the varied demands and impacts associated with the sector, (b) create the capacity for
effective development, implementation, monitoring and enforcement of rules that ensure
effective monitoring and enforcement of policies, laws and regulations; and (c) clarify roles and
responsibilities of decision-makers to ensure accountability through transparent and non-
discretionary processes that are inclusive of a broad set of stakeholder views and reinforced by
codes of acceptable conduct.

While there have been qualitative descriptors of DSM potential, quantitative estimates of the
potential, in-situ resource value remain restricted to just 2-3 prospects that have advanced to the
feasibility stage, reflecting the industry's limited progress towards feasibility. Pacific Island
governments face a complex array of technical challenges. Appropriate fiscal regimes to deliver
equitable Government ‘take’, steps to manage those funds sustainably, and the full economic
impact of DSM are untested. Core to understanding this potential (financial and economic) is to
have sound estimates of the in-situ value of these deposits, some estimates of the capital and


                                                                                                16
operating costs for production and full payment of taxes and royalties, factoring in the cost of
meeting the full contractual and regulatory compliance necessary to keep a license holding in good
standing. As is the case for environmental and social impacts, the appropriate fiscal regime and
economic benefit to DSM is not clearly understood, although progress has been made in a few
specific project cases, such as Solwara 1.

Many foundational actions and analyses have begun. The Pacific Community (SPC), with support
from the European Union, has mobilized leading specialists to prepare draft policies and laws,
model frameworks to guide economic, environmental, social performance, regulations to improve
contractual and regulatory compliance, and assess institutional needs. Workshops, public
consultations, learning events, and other stakeholder input processes have been undertaken. And
estimates of cost / benefit have begun using indicative costs and assumed fiscal regimes. In all,
what has been accomplished by the SPC is commendable, given the multitude of challenges,
diversity of views on DSM, and geography encompassed by sector activity. The Commonwealth
Secretariat has provided legal and economic policy advice, including the Cook Islands Seabed
Minerals Act 2009, which has served as a benchmark for other states, and assisted Kiribati by
funding a DSM Adviser to be based with the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resource
Development. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), through its regional Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) has provided assistance to Tonga and Cook Islands on (i)
developing a fiscal policy for raising DSM revenue, and (ii) drafting relevant taxation and royalty
regime laws. The IMF PFTAC and the SPC EU DSM Project also collaborated to develop a 'Regional
Financial Framework' for DSM in the region (SPC, 2016c.)

Common to the above experiences is a reported (a) significant capacity deficiency on collection
and dissemination of geological data and mineral resource information; (b) DSM national policies
and laws that vary to some extent from one nation to the next and remain largely untested; (c)
fiscal frameworks for DSM that are either direct extensions or derivatives of terrestrial mining
frameworks, whose risk profiles and underlying assumptions are materially different, (d) weak
understanding of the appropriate environmental framework given the deep marine environment,
(e) near total neglect of the social policies necessary for DSM to ensure adequate / commensurate
benefit sharing, and (f) institutional weakness across licensing, regulatory compliance monitoring,
and revenues management. Most importantly, the majority of nations for which DSM is a potential
industry have no previous experience in overseeing large-scale terrestrial mining sector activities.

Under these circumstances there is need for caution, giving special attention to protecting the
marine environment and the people who value it. A sound precautionary approach, which does
not preclude the option of ‘no development’ is needed to avoid or minimize temporary or lasting
harm to the environment, to the people and to the economy. This forms the starting point for this

Background
What is Deep Sea Mining?

There is some confusion as to what actually constitutes ‘deep sea mining’ and a variety of
definitions exist according to which the cut offs between ‘near shore mining’ and ‘deep sea mining’
are set at different depths. Those different definitions are typically shaped by:

    •      Whether specialized equipment is required due to the pressures that are encountered at
           depth, or whether more conventional technology (i.e. dredging) can be used;

    •      Whether it is occurring at a depth at which sunlight is still present (the photic zone) and
           the kind of corals, fish and other sea life that exist at different depths;

    •      Whether it is likely to interact with other resource uses such as traditional, and potential
           future fishing.

These factors are variable and imprecise – sunlight penetration is heavily influenced by the
turbidity of the water; different countries have different limits and practices around bottom
trawling fishing; some marine mammals can range from the surface to more than 2,000m of depth
in their diving. Near shore mining already exists and typically focuses on sand, gravel, coral, alluvial
precious metals and stones and normally uses trailing suction dredge technology. This is commonly
used to extract building materials and as part of land reclamation projects. Near shore precious
stone mining includes operations such as De Beers Marine’s diamond mining off the coast of
Namibia. There are also some examples of near shore mineral sands (e.g. iron sands) operations.

Maritime Zones and the Jurisdictional Limits of DSM Activities
Deep sea mineral deposits occur in various Maritime Zones. Maritime Zones are defined and
described the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). UNCLOS is the primary
legal instrument for the governance of the world's oceans and seas. It sets out the rules governing
all uses of the oceans and their resources. Maritime Zones are described in Articles 1, 3, 33, 55, 57,
76, and 86. Information in these provisions are summarized below.

Baselines
In order for States to determine and measure the maritime zones applicable to their territories,
States start by determining their baselines. As specified in Article 14, a coastal State may determine
its baselines in accordance with any of the methods mentioned in Articles 7-13 of UNCLOS. Once a


       the preparation of this document, PNG was reported to be adopting the Precautionary Approach,
2 During

subsequent adoption of this approach has not been confirmed.

                                                                                                    18
coastal State has determined its baselines, it must make those baselines publicly known in charts
or lists of geographical coordinates and deposit a copy of each such chart or list with the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, in terms of Article 16(2).

Territorial Sea
As stated in Article 3 of UNCLOS, the breadth of a coastal State’s territorial sea is up to a limit not
exceeding 12 nautical miles, measured from its baselines.

Contiguous Zone
The contiguous zone is the area ‘contiguous’ to the coastal State’s territorial sea, which may not
extend beyond 24 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea
is measured, according to Article 33 of the UNCLOS.

Exclusive Economic Zone
The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, which in
addition shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of
the territorial sea is measured.
The total area of EEZs controlled by Pacific Island Countries and Territories is 27.8 million km2
(compared with a land area of about 531,000 km2 - a ratio of 52:1.) (Map 2). Additionally, the area
of Extended Continental Shelf (ECS) represents an additional 2.0 million km2, over which coastal
states exercise jurisdictional rights over mineral resources.

Continental Shelf
According to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, the Continental Shelf of a
coastal State comprises the submerged prolongation of the land territory of the coastal State - the
seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond the coastal State’s territorial sea to
the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles where the outer
edge of the continental margin does not extend up to that distance. The continental margin
consists of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise. It does not include the deep
ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.

The “Area”
The “Area” is defined in Article 1 of UNCLOS as the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof,
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The Area and its resources are the “common heritage of
mankind” as stated in Article 136 of UNCLOS. All rights in the resources of the Area are vested in
“mankind as a whole”. It is the International Seabed Authority (ISA) which is authorized to act on
behalf of mankind in respect of the Area.




                                                                                                   19
States may also sponsor DSM exploration and exploitation activities in the Area. The Cook Islands,
Kiribati, Tonga, and Nauru all act as Sponsoring States for exploration activities in the Clarion
Clipperton Fracture Zone.3

Deep Sea Mineral Deposits in the Pacific Island EEZs

To date, three main kinds of deep sea mineral deposit types have been identified within the
national jurisdiction of several Pacific island countries (SPC, 2013b):

    •   Seafloor massive sulphides (SMS) are found at hydro-thermal vents (both active as well as
        inactive volcanic vents) on the seafloor at 1,500-5,000m depth which precipitate out
        concentrated minerals, including copper, iron, zinc, silver, and gold. This resource is under
        development in Nautilus Mineral’s Solwara-1 project in PNG (see Chapter 3). Some PICs
        known to have SMS occurrences are Fiji, PNG, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu

    •   Polymetallic manganese nodules (PMN) – often occurring at great depths (4,000 –
        6,000m), these nodules can contain a mix of cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel
        and zinc. These are the kind of resources prospected for in the Clarion Clipperton Fracture
        Zone (CCFZ) and they are known to occur in the waters of the Cook Islands and Kiribati,
        and to a lesser extent in Niue and Tuvalu.

    •   Cobalt manganese crusts – which can contain other minerals including precious metals
        (platinum) and Rare Earth Elements (REE). They are found in a range of 400-4,000m of



                                                                                                 21
        depth and are known to occur in Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of
        Micronesia, Niue, Palau, Samoa and Tuvalu (Figure 2).

Box 1. DSM: the New Frontier for Rare Earth Elements?


 An important aspect that gives the rationale for DSM exploration/exploitation some more nuance is that
 these deposits are polymetallic and may contain rare earth elements (REEs). REEs are considered strategic
 minerals and an important component in new technologies, especially within the clean energy, military, and
 consumer electronics sectors. As these sectors continue to grow and diversify so will the demand for REEs
 however, despite this growing demand, there is a lack of security in the supply chain. In 2011, over 95% of
 global REE supply originated from China. China is also has the largest demand for REEs, at 65% of total. The
 US is the next largest consumer, at 15% of total demand. Reduction in exports from China in 2010 created
 large instability in the REEs market which led other countries to look for alternative sources (Hatch, 2012).
 As REEs occur with other minerals reserves are either in small or low-concentration deposits. This makes
 specific mining for REEs challenging with the number of readily mineable REE deposits small increasing the
 attractiveness of DSM and its strategic relevance even more accentuated.

 Rare earth elements have several industrial uses worldwide but are primarily used in the electronics and
 electrical fields such as rechargeable batteries, computer memory, cell phones, DVDs, magnets, car catalytic
 converters, fluorescent lighting, and several other instruments. The worldwide demand for these electronic
 devices and instruments has quadrupled and will continue to grow. Additional supplies of REEs will be
 needed to meet this demands. There are several industries such as petroleum refining, glass polishing,
 chemical catalysts, metallurgy, catalytic converters, permanent magnets production, television and
 monitors, etc. where these rare earth elements are also needed in abundance. REEs are essential for
 manufacturing rechargeable batteries which are used to power up several electrical and electronic devices,
 digital cameras, computers, laptops, hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles.

DSM Mining Technology
Technological breakthroughs towards commercial DSM mining should be expected; most likely in
the waters of Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu, New Zealand and Japan.
Governments, principally Russia, China, Korea, India, Japan, are also supporting detailed geodetic
/ geological surveys to assess mineral resource endowment, seeking to understand the commercial
viability of these resources viz. ongoing investor interest and current supply / demand trends.
These programs will yield a first descriptor of the inventory of potentially recoverable minerals
using current technologies and prevailing prices (the gross value, in-situ).

The technology for extraction varies somewhat from project to project, depending on a variety of
deposit and seafloor characteristics. Some projects propose to use submersible suction dragged
and positioned by surface ships; others propose to use seabed ‘crawlers’ (i.e. that could move
themselves rather than be positioned only by the ship) that would suction up the material on the


                                                                                              24
seabed, or cut through and grind material on the seabed to then be transported to the surface
through a separate suction system or crawler.

Deep sea engineering is of course not a new or unknown technology - dredging, marine cable laying
and the offshore oil industry have all worked on various technologies that feed into the technology
that is proposed for seabed mining, and indeed a number of companies in this area (e.g. Boskalis,
Royal IHC, KIOST, JOGMEC) are investigating and have interests in seabed mining ventures. It
should be noted, however, that the process of DSM mining has been estimated by various
specialists to have widely varying environmental impacts, including in some cases irreversible
damage to the marine ecosystem as detailed in SPC (2016b) and summarized in Annex 1. DSM
mining is of a completely different nature, magnitude and severity than any other deep sea
engineering activities carried out so far.

Drivers of Deep Sea Mining
Factors that make seabed mining unique and which are driving investment and interest in these
areas are:

    •   The long-term decline of the grade of many onshore minerals compared to relatively
        untouched and high-grade seabed deposits.

    •   Lack of fixed capital and infrastructure: while much of the capital cost in accessing
        terrestrial mines is fixed in the form of roads, trenches, pits and drives (tunnels) to access
        resources; the capital investment in seabed mining is mobile, with the primary advantages
        being that it can be removed in advance of extreme natural events; should a project
        encounter political or social barriers or disruptions; or when a resource is exhausted.

    •   Terrestrial mines are increasingly constrained by proximity to settlements and
        communities as well as areas with high environmental values.

    •   The ability to ship mined materials directly to markets can obviate the need for expensive
        infrastructure development such as roads, railways and export ports that is often a major
        cost in terrestrial mining.

    •   Average mine life for Solwara 1 is expected to be around 2-3 years, similar to some
        terrestrial artisanal and small scale mines, but very different from the longer term large
        mines which often exceed 35 years. However, if a series of deposits are mined sequentially
        the overall “mine life” could be long.

    •   One important attraction of DSM deposits is the higher grade compared to equivalent land
        resources which translates into a higher value per ton of ore produced. Another important
        aspect that gives the rationale for DSM exploration/exploitation some more nuance is that
        these deposits are polymetallic and contain Rare Earth Elements (REEs) (Box 1).

Box 2. Deep Sea Mining Cycle: from Prospecting to Exploitation
 Prospecting -- the search for DSM deposits within designated license and/or national areas
 including estimation of the composition, size and distribution of deposits and their economic
 values, without any exclusive rights.
 Exploration -- searching for and measurement (grade and tonnage) of deposits of DSM (either in
 the Area or within national jurisdictions) with exclusive rights; and the analysis of such deposits,
 the use and testing of recovery systems and equipment, processing facilities and transportation
 systems, and the carrying out of studies for the environmental, social, technical, economic,
 commercial and other appropriate factors that must be taken into account in exploitation.
 Exploitation- the recovery for commercial purposes of DSM from the seabed (either in the Area
 or within national jurisdiction), and the extraction of minerals, including the construction and
 operation of mining, processing and transportation systems, for the production and marketing of
 minerals, intermediate processed products or metals.


Ongoing and Proposed DSM Projects in the Pacific Islands

As detailed in Table 1 below, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu
have granted DSM exploration permits. PNG is the only country to have granted a license to mine
so far, for the Solwara 1 Project.

Table 1. DSM Engagement by Country (Status as of June 2016)
 Country        DSM Engagement
 Cook Islands   Abundant manganese nodule occurrence, with high cobalt content, has been identified
                within the Cook islands EEZ. There is strong political will to attract DSM investment;
                however, an international invitation to tender for exploration in the EEZ in 2015 did not
                yield any applications. Cook Islands lodged an application with the ISA in December 2013,
                for an exploration contract for nodules in ‘the Area’, in partnership with GSR.
 Federated      FSM’s EEZ is considered to have CRC potential, and some indicators of possible SMS
 States of      deposits. FSM has had initial discussions with an exploration company interested in SMS
 Micronesia     (but the Government is unable to issue licences within the EEZ until relevant laws are
                enacted). There is strong political will to attract DSM investment, to cover budget shortfalls
                anticipated by the end of US compact in 2023.
 Fiji           Hydrothermal vents with SMS potential have been identified in Fiji’s EEZ (both in the Lau
                and North Fiji Basin areas). Exploration licences have been issued by the Government
                within Fiji’s EEZ to KIOST and Nautilus. Fiji has also expressed interest in sponsoring activity
                in ‘the Area’, and has met with Lockheed in that regard.
 Kiribati       The largest EEZ in the region, with nodule and CRC potential. No DSM licences yet issued in
                the EEZ. A Kiribati State company, ‘Marawa Research and Exploration Ltd’ holds an ISA
                contract for nodule exploration in the CCFZ. DeepGreen prepared and funded Kiribati’s
                application in return for an off-take agreement. The EEZ borders the nodule-rich CCFZ – in
                ‘the Area’, currently the subject of 12 ISA exploration contracts. (Raising a possible
                opportunity for Kiribati to offer ‘local services’ e.g. refueling and other supplies for vessels.)
 Marshall       Seamounts in the western part of RMI’s EEZ have significant CRC potential. Japan, Russia
 Islands        and China have recently taken ISA exploration contracts for CRC in sites close to RMI’s and



                                                                                                            26

                 FSM’s EEZ. RMI has not been approached by any DSM companies, and has not issued any
                 DSM licences.
 Nauru           No data has been collected on the potential of seabed minerals within Nauru’s EEZ. A local
                 company, Nauru Offshore Resources Inc (NORI) holds an ISA contract for nodule
                 exploration in the CCFZ. DeepGreen prepared and funded the application in return for an
                 offtake agreement, and sits on the Board of Directors.
 Niue            Surveys of Niue's EEZ suggest little promise of nodule potential but more encouraging CRC
                 potential. Further surveys are required for better assessment.
 Palau           Surveys confirm the occurrence of CRC and phosphate, as well as indications of SMS.
                 Nodule potential is also possible. Further surveys are required for better assessment. In
                 2013 the President proposed that the entire EEZ should be a ‘no-take’ marine protected
                 area.
 Papua New       PNG’s EEZ contains SMS with high-grade copper, gold and silver. In January 2011 PNG
 Guinea          granted a world-first lease to Nautilus4 to carry out DSM mining within its EEZ: the Solwara
                 1 Project in the Bismarck Sea. Although a dispute with Government and challenges in
                 raising capital had stalled Nautilus’ progress, mining is now slated to commence in 2018.
                 The SPC Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) report estimates raising US$80m from one DSM
                 project from taxes and royalties. A number of SMS deposits in the Nautilus licence area in
                 PNG are expected to be further assessed and ready to be mined by 2020.
 Samoa           Samoa’s EEZ is small, prospecting to date has not discovered promising nodule deposits,
                 and the EEZ’s geologically-young seamounts do not suggest positive CRC potential. Samoa
                 has expressed interest in DSM activities in ‘the Area’, and held discussions in 2013 with
                 COMRA.
 Solomon         EEZ contains significant SMS deposits. Ninety DSM exploration licenses issued by the
 Islands         Government to Nautilus and Neptune. Exploration activities are ongoing. Applications for
                 DSM mining from Neptune Minerals were received by Government in late 2013.
 Tonga           EEZ contains significant SMS deposits (in the Lau Basin). Granted licenses for exploration
                 within its EEZ to three companies (Nautilus, KIOST and Neptune), whose findings are
                 commercially attractive. 2011 Government sponsored a Nautilus subsidiary (Tonga
                 Offshore Minerals Ltd) to obtain an exploration contract to explore the CCFZ in ‘the Area’
                 for nodules
 Tuvalu          Prospecting results show nodules and CRC, but lower abundance and grade than in other
                 PICs’ EEZs. Expressed interest in sponsoring DSM activity in ‘the Area’, and has met with
                 one DSM company.
 Vanuatu         EEZ contains SMS deposits. More than 150 DSM exploration licenses have been granted
                 within the EEZ to Nautilus and Neptune.

4 Nautilus Minerals is by far and away the dominant commercial player in seabed minerals exploration and
development in the South Pacific, holding approximately 423,000km2 of exploration tenements (either
under application or awarded) in Fiji, New Zealand, PNG, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, as well
as in the CCFZ via its subsidiary Tonga Offshore Mining Limited. Active exploration, however, appears to be
currently limited to PNG and the Solomon Islands. It is also the company closest to the development of a
producing deep sea mine with its Solwara-1 project in Papua New Guinea. Nautilus Mineral is publicly listed
on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), its three largest shareholders are MB Holdings (Oman), Metalloinvest
Holding Limited (Cyprus), and Anglo-American PLC.

Chapter 1. Some Knowns but Many Unknowns about DSM
Deep Seabed Resource Potential at a Glance

Core to understanding the economic potential of DSM is to first determine the in-situ value of
minerals given the technologies available to exploit them, second to deduct from the in-situ value
of minerals the capital and operating costs and risk-adjusted private returns associated with
investing in the location, appraisal and exploitation of DSM deposits and third consider how any
costs attributable to social and environmental impacts are treated, for purposes of weighing the
net private and public benefits of DSM, taking into account the public cost of environmental
impacts.

A high level of uncertainty is connected with each of the three factors highlighted above and the
regulatory mechanisms through which risks are allocated among private and public actors are far
from fully developed. Having said that, it must be recognized that a number of PICs either have
developed or are in the process of developing robust policy, legislation or both in place with the
assistance of the SPC-EU DSM Project and other partners. Any assessment of the overall
cost/benefit of proceeding with DSM, therefore, faces a set of challenges that is perhaps an order
of magnitude greater than typically encountered in the case of terrestrial mining.

To date there have been rather few comprehensive evaluations of the financial cost/benefit of
DSM mining, other than those contained in project specific submissions by project sponsors to
regulators and financial institutions. Recently, a study has been completed on behalf of the SPC,
which undertook an economic and financial cost/benefit assessment of a hypothetical mining
operation for each of the three main deposit types found in the Pacific in deep water.

Seafloor Massive Sulphide Resources

Based on current knowledge, out of the more than 200 sites of hydrothermal mineralization
currently known, only about 10 deposits are currently considered likely to have sufficient size and
grade to be of commercial interest for DSM mining. SMS deposit areas are small (e.g. generally
between 0.1-10 km2of seafloor surface area), but made viable through the high concentration of
metals (clusters of richly mineralized chimneys).

Manganese Nodule Resources

While the nodules can be found in many regions of the world’s oceans, there are four primary
locations with densities high enough for potential commercial extraction: (1) the Clarion Clipperton
Zone, (2) the Peru basin, (3) the Penrhyn basin in the Cook Islands, and (4) the Indian Ocean. With
respect to density, the commonly accepted cut-off in nodule density for commercial mining is
approximately 5 kg/m2. While highly variable, nodule density within the Cook Islands EEZ ranges
from 5 kg/ m2 to more than 50kg /m2.

While the crusts cover approximately 2% of the ocean floor, the Central Pacific region, particularly
the EEZs around Johnston Island, Hawaii, RMI, the Federated States of Micronesia, and
international waters in the mid-Pacific offer the greatest potential for crust mining because of their
thickness, exposure and metal grades.

The Importance of Industry Learning and Cost

Perhaps the core key challenges to DSM mining is that it is an industry in its infancy. As such, what
is proposed today in terms of the size of an operation and associated technology is a starting point
on a path that would certainly evolve through time as significant learning occurs. Present
performance is not indicative of future performance. The underlying costs for DSM are projected
and have yet to be verified empirically through many actual mining operations. Currently proposed
technologies to harvest the mineral resource may be less profitable in the earliest years but would
yield significant information upon which the industry would then innovate and improve. And,
there is a need to differentiate between different types of mining on the seafloor (from various
technologies) that may become as diverse as that which exists in terrestrial mining.6 In this report,
and more broadly, speculating on the cost structure and profitability of DSM mining at this stage
may not be a terribly fruitful exercise, nor is putting any numbers on the potential financial, and
fiscal revenues that could be generated.

Need for Cost Models

For government planning purposes, there is need to better understand costs and potential
revenues. What is currently available are some indicative costs that have emerged from a limited
number of proposed operations, using current market conditions and initial design of new DSM
technologies. For long-range planning purposes by governments, cost models are needed to allow
better understanding of the costs associated to mining each type of deposit and the economic
returns expected to be generated. In addition, these costs would influence the definition of the

6
  For DSM cost models may vary according to: (a) SMS; (b) metallic nodules; and (c) Cobalt-rich
ferromanganese crust.

                                                                                                      30
fiscal regimes for DSM mining in the PICs. Given few DSM mining experiences on which to draw,
the information to be used to create a cost model might include current literature, company
technical reports and interviews with exploration companies. In preparing this report,
consideration has been given to the major steps towards preparing such cost models in support of
long-range planning; and are thought to include:

        a.      Evaluate current literature, company’s reports and conduct interviews with
        exploration companies to assess indicated or measured reserves (depending on the data
        available) for one of each of the three types of known deposits within the PIC countries;
        b.      Assess size and grade of expected deposits and associated capital and operating
        costs (by deposit type);
        c.      Simulate many times expected changes to the size of the operations, recoveries,
        costs, market conditions and varying fiscal regimes;
        d.       Arrive at curves that describe associated costs and benefits (including but not
        limited to revenue), and the distribution of these benefits geographically and across time
        in order to inform long-range planning of DSM mining by governments.

Cost Benchmarks that Change in Time

In terrestrial mining, each new operation is often compared using global benchmarks of capital and
operating costs that come from an extensive pool of ongoing and past operations. These
comparators often vary by commodity type and by the broad geological characteristics used to
classify a mineral occurrence according to a particular “deposit model”. Setting aside these
differences, the end result is a set of benchmark costs that reflect learning in a multitude of
geological and political / economic environments – and within an industry that is ever innovating.
Indeed, one measure of the global mining industry is the ability of companies to deploy large
amounts of capital into technology suites, pilot and learn, and then improve through further
innovation. This ability to deploy capital in order to learn has propelled the industry towards
improvements across (a) exploration / exploitation technologies, (b) mining and metallurgical
productivity, (c) de-risking exposure to uncertainties and use of structured financing, and (d)
improved information collection / management / dissemination regarding costs and the
distribution of benefits.

By definition, key to learning is time. Some improvements require up to a decade initially, before
rapid acceleration in technological innovation that will lead to improved resource efficiency, larger
resource rents to be shared, and arriving at the appropriate fiscal policy to guide the allocation of
those rents. Indeed, one indicator of the degree to which the industry is learning is the rate of
technology switching seen in recapitalization of operations.7 And in this regard, learning comes

7
  A good example of technology switching is seen in the global copper industry that moved from smaller
higher-grade deposits to bulk tonnage operations using advanced mining technologies that significantly
reduced costs. Concurrently, advances in metallurgical processing led to the mining of new mineralogies
that previously had been considered waste. The industry is ever-learning and improving the deployment of
technologies, thus improving the commercial viability of operations.

                                                                                                     31
with risk and losses. Mining companies require an acceptable return to their capital over time, in
order to endure strong commodity cyclicity and associated profit and losses that may partially
result from inefficiencies and technological weaknesses. So, what may appear an excessively high
return on capital in one period may be recovering losses or low returns in the past or future, driven
in part by the deployment of new technologies. And so fiscal policy is also underpinned by a
recognition of the need to incentivize the industry to continue to innovate, which is effectively
years of industry learning.

While projections of potential revenue streams and economic linkages from DSM are difficult to
predict now, there are some guiding principles that can be adopted going forward. To ensure that
governments and communities receive the resource rents and other associated benefits they are
due, there is need to ensure that the processes by which contracts are awarded are competitive
and transparent; and backed by a regular comprehensive audit function. Moreover, the capture of
economic rent from DSM mining should be focused beyond direct payments alone (taxes, royalties,
fees etc.), towards indirect / induced economic linkages which come from strengthening
interrelationships with other activities on the landscape. This broadening of perspective recognizes
the need for DSM mining to be a driver of “local content” from the outset. And so, while present
DSM performance may not be indicative of future performance, ensuring local content guides the
overall industry.

Environmental Impacts and Risks 8

Ecosystems and biodiversity at the depths in question and their links with coastal or pelagic
ecosystems are poorly understood and documented. Furthermore, because no exploitation has
taken place to date, there is no real-life data on how it might influence these ecosystems and the
services they provide. Consequently, discussions have not been informed by experience but rather
by expectations, experiences with terrestrial mines, and models.9

Reports prepared under the SPC EU EDF 10 Deep Sea Minerals Project (SPC, 2013a- c; SPC, 2016b)
lay out expected impacts by type of deposit and associated mining technologies, and by project
stage. In summary, “prospecting is expected to have very minimal environmental impact” since
“most prospecting studies that are conducted are remote sensing (e.g., ship based or towed
sensors) with a few seafloor samples taken to confirm data interpretation. Exploration is expected
to have minimal to moderate environmental impact. Many exploration techniques leave no lasting
impact on the seafloor, with the exception of drilling, dredging, and test mining. Any test mining
activities conducted under an exploration permit – whether at a reduced scale or not, will have
impacts, though on a smaller areal scale.“ Impacts of exploitation “are expected to be severe at
the mine site, and potentially permanent.” The significant differences in geological settings and
physical and biological characteristics among the three types of deep sea mineral deposits lead to
differences in the mining methods and the management of their impacts.” (SPC, 2016b). In addition
to extraction, disposal from the mining vessel of solid and hazardous wastes, overburden,
separated seawater, and tailings may cause environmental impacts (SPC, 2016b). Annex 3 presents
in detail possible environmental impacts by mine type.

Processing of materials mined to recover metals will also cause environmental impacts; however,
it is generally expected that no processing will take place in any of the PICs. 10 Furthermore,
compared to terrestrial mining, DSM will not have any ancillary impact on the environment, such
as through road construction. Conversely, however, one cannot ignore the environmental risks
involved with shipping activities.

On the other hand, concern has been expressed that DSM mining and related activities may impact
other economic resources. This includes off-shore and coastal fisheries through destruction of
ocean floor habitats at the mining site, sediment and discharge water plumes, noise, and pollution
through accidental skills and leakages. Two factors seem to be instrumental: the nature of the
minerals mined, i.e. massive sulphide minerals v. manganese nodules, and the technology being


8 Chapter  2 presents a discussion on costs and benefits of DSM operations and on deep sea and marine
ecosystem services.
9
  The lack of factual data has also impacted regulatory decisions by the International Seabed Authority (ISA)
which is currently in the process of drafting a Regulatory Framework for Mineral Exploitation in the Area
(ISA, 2015), and regulators in otherwise high-capacity bureaucracies such as that of New Zealand’s.
10
   There may be some processing stages, including initial separation and concentration that take place either
on the mine vessel or at a shore-based facility but smelting and refining to obtain metals requires scale and

used. “Dredging” of areas where manganese nodules are found seems to have been entirely
devastating. However, long term impacts of DSM on fisheries is very poorly understood. Nautilus
reported to have commissioned a study modelling the impact of a possible break of the riser as
part of the Solwara 1 Project Environmental Impact Assessment. Under the SPC EU DSM Project,
SPC has commissioned a similar study. Increased vessel traffic, no matter what form it takes, will
always represent an environmental risk and impact, and may also negatively impact tourism, e.g.
whale watching and transportation, as well as scientific exploration. While the impacts of individual
DSM mining projects have been the focus of impact assessment to date, the cumulative impacts
of DSM mining have hardly begun to be assessed. Is therefore fortunate that SPC, with EU support,
will commission an independent assessment of the potential impacts of DSM mining on Pacific
Island fisheries. The six-month desk study will cover potential impacts from all types of DSM mining
including both exploration and exploitation on all types of commercial artisanal and subsistence
fisheries resources that exist in the EEZs of the 15 Pacific states assisted by the SPC-EU DSM Project.

Social Impacts and Risks

Stakeholder concerns are influenced by the many unknowns related to DSM mining as well as prior
experiences with terrestrial mining 11 The concerns expressed by communities and non-



11Terrestrial mining has a long history in PNG, Solomon Islands and Fiji, and was also once the main
economic activity in Nauru. Other PICs by comparison have seen little or no mining aside from low intensity
recovery of sand, stone, coral and other minerals for construction and other uses.

                                                                                                       34
governmental organizations (Rosenbaum, 2011; SPC, 2014; Blue Ocean Law & PANG, 2016) may
be broadly grouped under the following five broad, interrelated categories: 12

     •    Impact on livelihoods. This concern is about the impact DSM mining may have on fisheries,
          and on tourism. Regarding fisheries, communities depend on employment in commercial
          fishing or on coastal fishing, worry that noise and pollution caused by the mining
          operations and accidental toxic spills would harm the resource13 and impact the health of
          coastal communities whose diet consists largely of fish. Communities are also concerned
          that their access to traditional fishing grounds may be restricted when certain areas are
          assigned to DSM mining, even when the DSM legislation recognizes customary user rights.)
          Furthermore, tourism which contributes to local economies may suffer from pollution and
          impact on unique cultural practices that draw tourists. Concern has been expressed that
          the livelihoods of vulnerable groups, including indigenous groups (Box 3), women and
          children is most at risk.

     •    Getting a share of the benefits / revenue management by government. There is a concern
          that weak governance would result in poor management of revenues from DSM mining
          operations, and that communities would not receive a fair share of the revenues or
          compensation for damages they may incur from DSM mining projects.

     •    Limited employment and other economic opportunities. Communities are also concerned
          that the technology intensive nature of DSM mining and processing of minerals being
          planned in other countries will significantly limit employment opportunities for local DSM
          mining operations.

     •    Impact on customs, spiritual values. Various sources documenting the reaction of the
          public in the PICs to DSM speak of a spiritual association or identification with the Pacific
          Ocean which is vast compared the territories of the islands14 and plays a significant role in
          the livelihoods and daily lives of most communities. This connection manifests itself in
          some cultural practices, such as shark calling15 practiced by some local communities in
          PNG’s New Ireland Province, which they fear would be affected by the noise, vessel traffic
          and pollution caused by DSM mining.16

island states” which is how the PICs are sometimes referred too.

   Sharkcalling is practiced in the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. It involves religious rituals
followed by luring a shark to one's canoe in the open sea and catching it with the help of a noose. The
practice is closely tied to the local indigenous communities’ creation story. Source:

      •   Adequacy of consultations. Concern has been expressed that consultations with local
          communities on DSM policy and legislation in general have not been adequate. In the case
          of Solwara 1, while the company has carried out a large number of consultation events,
          critics have pointed out lack of sufficient advance notice, narrow outreach, and insufficient
          focus on eliciting communities’ concerns. Critics have also voiced concern that new / draft
          DSM mining legislation in some countries does not embed processes through which
          communities may participate in decision making on DSM management.

Box 3. Diverging Views on the Applicability of the Concepts of “Indigenous Peoples” and the
“Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent”
     Some civil society organizations, such as Blue Ocean Law and the Pacific Network on Globalization (PANG)
     have argued that PIC governments and partner regional organizations need to take into account the
     concerns and interests of Indigenous Peoples in the Pacific Island countries. They also argued that
     Indigenous Peoples’ “right to free, prior, and informed consent” (FPIC) when developing DSM related
     policies needs to be respected. Not doing so would violate Indigenous Peoples’ “rights to land, culture and
     their resources.” 17

     There is no universal definition of the term “Indigenous Peoples”. The prevailing view even among
     Indigenous Peoples themselves is that no such definition is necessary. The term generally refers to people
     whose identities are inextricably linked to the lands on which they live and the natural resources on which
     they depend, who have historical continuity or association with a given region or area prior to colonization
     or annexation, who have continued to maintain distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural
     institutions different from the dominant society, and who identify themselves as Indigenous Peoples.

     A number of international legal instruments recognize the rights of Indigenous Peoples. These legal
     instruments include the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which
     was adopted in 2007 as well as the International Labor Organization’s Convention No.169 (ILO 169)
     Concerning Indigenous People and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. A number of international
     financial institutions also have policies that require them to assess the positive and adverse effects on
     Indigenous Peoples of projects proposed for their financing. These institutions include the World Bank with
     its Operational Policy on Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10), the International Finance Corporation with its
     Performance Standard on Indigenous Peoples (PS 7) and the Asian Development Bank Safeguard Policy
     Statement.

     Both the UNDRIP and ILO 169 recognize the rights of Indigenous Peoples to free, prior, and informed
     consent (FPIC) for any development project affecting their lands and territories. When the Bank’s
     Indigenous Peoples policy was approved in May 2005, UNDRIP had not been adopted. Instead of FPIC, the
     Bank’s policy on Indigenous Peoples requires that for all projects proposed for financing by the World Bank
     and affecting Indigenous Peoples, the borrower engages in a process of free, prior, and informed
     consultation with Indigenous Peoples, leading to their broad community support for the project. The Bank’s
     newly approved Environmental and Social Framework includes a new Standard on Indigenous Peoples,

     which now embraces the concept of FPIC. The Bank follows a process laid out in this Policy Framework to
     determine the groups that would be treated as IPs.

     The basic principles of FPIC are to ensure that Indigenous Peoples are not coerced or intimidated, that their
     consent is sought and freely given prior to the authorization or start of any activities, that they have full
     information about the scope and impacts of any proposed developments, and that ultimately their choices
     to give or withhold consent are respected.

     The situation of Indigenous Peoples varies from region to region and from country to country. For instance,
     the SPC contends that “in a Pacific context, the concept of ‘indigenous people’ as presented above can only,
     with difficulty, be applied to most Pacific Islands and societies. Firstly, because the vast majority of island
     population can claim to be indigenous. Secondly, because the political efforts to ensure unity and solidarity
     amongst different ethnic groups of the same population call for broad uniformity and not fragmentation.
     Thirdly, because island communities play a key role in the social and political governance systems in place
     across the Pacific nations which do not require the need to segregate nor discriminate groups of the same
     population.” Furthermore, SPC argues that “the implementation of the FPIC concept in a DSM context is
     haltered by several legal issues including: (i) The general inadequacy and the lack of recognition of the FPIC
     concept in the Pacific context where Pacific Leaders support traditional forms of Pacific Island governance;
     (ii) the fact that FPIC applies to a particular community, which land, property or resources will be affected
     by Government decision. In fact, most of the legislation already in place in P-ACP States, DSM are vested in
     the State/Crown and not in communities; and (iii) the legal status of the FPIC principle has not acquired the
     status of customary international law”. 18

     SPC emphasizes that “conscious of the potential impacts that the DSM industry could cause to PICs and to
     some communities, has been steadily emphasizing (SPC-EU DSM Project, 2016, p.32) the need to engage
     and consult with local communities and civil society in general, defending the need for government to (i)
     adopt an inclusive participatory approach to make sure that island populations and traditional leaders have
     access to the relevant information as well as the right to express their concerns, and (ii) take all concerns
     into consideration in making any decisions.

Chapter 2. Given the Risks: Apply the Precautionary Approach
Definition of the Precautionary Approach

Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration states: “In order to protect the environment, the
precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where
there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used
as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”19 In
fact, as shown in the previous chapter, risks exist not only in terms of environmental impacts, but
also in social, economic and fiscal matters. Therefore, a broader definition in the context of risk
management may be applied. “The precautionary principle or precautionary approach to risk
management states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or
to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is not harmful,
the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action.”20 The overwhelming
uncertainty regarding social, environmental, economic and fiscal impacts warrants the application
by policy makers and regulators of the Precautionary Approach to DSM operations.

In general, the mining industry appears ready to embrace the principle of Precautionary Approach.
The International Marine Minerals Society’s Code for Environmental Management for Marine
Mining (ISA, 2010) which was adopted by ISA in 2010 calls for “the use of appropriate risk
management strategies and the precautionary approach to guide exploration, extraction, waste
disposal and closure, and to identify environmental risks, their possible consequences, and their
probabilities of occurrence.” Specifically mining companies ought to “adopt the precautionary
approach in managing identified environmental risks.”

The Process of Applying the Precautionary Approach and Key Supporting
Elements

SPC has laid out the five steps in applying the Precautionary Approach to DSM mining (Figure 5).
The process is an ongoing and iterative one in that completion of Step 5 leads back to Step 1 in
order to reevaluate the likely harm and the necessary approaches. The process is managed by a
regulatory authority with strong stakeholder participation.21

Stakeholder Participation
Stakeholder participation is fundamental to the satisfactory application of the precautionary
approach, as it is to the mitigation of negative impacts caused by any investment projects. The IFC
Performance Standard 1 defines stakeholder engagement as an ongoing process that may involve,
in varying degrees, the following elements: stakeholder analysis and planning, disclosure and

Step 1. Are precautionary measures needed?

In the first step, policy makers determine whether there is scientific evidence pointing at plausible harms
and if so, whether the plausible harm is irreversible or serious. If the answer is positive, then the
precautionary approach should be applied. As discussed in the previous section, some exploration
activities and most exploitation activities are likely to cause irreversible or serious harm.

Step 2. Degree of precaution needed

The level of precaution needed depends on the level of harm that is considered acceptable and the level
of protection that is considered necessary. Both of these questions are not only crucial but also challenging
to answer, mainly due to the dearth of data on the current status (“baseline”) of the marine ecosystem
and the services it provides, and on the changes that are likely to occur (“impact”) as a result of the DSM
mining project.

International law22 requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for serious harm to the marine
environment. Therefore, some exploration and all exploitation activities will require an EIA. For most
prospecting and some exploration activities, a less comprehensive environmental assessment (EA) will be
required. In all cases, the assessment will cover not only the impacts on the physical (marine and possibly
coastal) environment, but also the social, economic and cultural dimensions of the human environment.
The assessment will document the baseline situation and assess the likely impact of the proposed
intervention. Furthermore, the EA/EIA will devise an environmental management plan, which also
outlines the monitoring requirements and specifies the roles of all involved as well as the associated costs.

23 Insome jurisdictions, submission of an EMP and EIA is not required to be simultaneous. As the Nautilus
sustainability manager commented in her written comments dated May 16, 2016, “[q]uite often the EMP has
management commitment that reflect detailed engineering designs, and as such often are written after the EIS,
when project design is finalized to the level of detail required to prescribe the engineering designs behind specific
commitments, and details such as where the monitoring stations will be located, how frequently they will be
monitored etc.”.

Box 4. What type of information is needed to determine acceptable harm?

    Research exploring the acceptability of DSM mining to Australian stakeholders found that stakeholders
    were primarily concerned about the potential environmental impact of DSM mining and highlighted
    the lack of baseline data “from which [they] rigorously evaluate the relative costs and benefits of
    seafloor mining activities.” In particular, stakeholders were interested in i) information on the nature
    and location of the proposed activity to evaluate potential impact on the marine habitats or other
    natural resources that were highly valued; ii) the environmental impacts and in particular, the scale and
    scope of the impacts as compared with the effects of human interventions in other significant
    endangered eco-systems, such as the Amazon; iii) the costs and benefits associated with the proposed
    DSM project, including not only environmental but also social and economic impacts; iv) how the
    industry would be regulated, and in particular how stakeholder and community consultation would be
    carried out; and (v) how independent and transparent the information shared would be.

Trade-offs: Need for sound cost - benefit analysis

Like any major investment project, a detailed economic cost-benefit analysis should be undertaken for
proposed DSM mining projects following established methodologies, which are presented in WBI (2001)
among others and considering issues specific to DSM-mining:

•     The cost benefit analysis should establish the current conditions (“the baseline”), the project scenario,
      and a counterfactual without project scenario. Expected changes to the baseline under the project
      should be compared with expected changes if the project is not undertaken.

•     The perspective of the analysis should be that of the society of the host country, including government
      and citizens, although, given cross-boundary environmental effects, a supplemental analysis from a
      regional perspective would also be useful. Additionally, the global community/humankind stands to
      benefit and lose from the impacts of DSM mining. For the latter, examples for benefits may be
      increased availability of minerals including rare earth and increased knowledge of deep sea
      ecosystems gained as part of environmental assessments and monitoring associated with DSM mining
      projects. A prime example for losses would be the environmental externalities (see below), in
      particular of deep sea ecosystems which may have significant existence and option value (scientific,
      genetic, pharmaceutical) to them (Box 6). Such values may have implications for channeling funds to
      conservation efforts (Barbier et al, 2014).

•     The analysis undertaken by the government should take into account not only a single project but the
      cumulative effects of existing and planned projects within the subject country’s EEZ and neighboring
      EEZs, whether or not they are implemented by the same company or exploit the same mineral type.24



24
   Ocean Foundation ( 2015) criticized the cost benefit analysis for the Solwara 1 (Earth Economics, 2015) for not
considering the cumulative impact of the planned Solwara 2-12 projects, for which the company has exploration
licenses.

                                                                                                                 42
•   The analysis should be comprehensive and strive to capture in monetary terms all costs and benefits
    to different sections of the society (Table 5). Focusing on the immediate mining site alone, which may
    be small, would miss a significant number of environmental externalities that would affect humans
    (see below and Box 3).

•   Government revenues are often straightforward to estimate based on the company’s projections on
    revenues and capital and O&M costs. Nevertheless, such projections should be subjected to rigorous
    sensitivity analyses to account for risks and uncertainties in costs due to the as yet commercially
    untested nature of extraction technologies, and unexpected weather patterns, and in revenues due
    to commodity price fluctuations, taking into account the specific contractual arrangements between
    the government and the company.

•   Environmental externalities. DSM mining may lead to a variety of negative environmental
    externalities, as presented in detail in Annex 1, which must be included in the economic analysis.
    Externalities may occur offshore and onshore. Special consideration would be given to offshore
    impacts, which may be on the seabed, and flora and fauna, on water quality and fauna living along
    the water column. These costs accrue through changes in the services that the impacted marine
    ecosystems provide. Such services are classified as provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting
    services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). The economic cost benefit analysis for a DSM
    mining project should analyze and, ideally, quantify the changes in the services likely to be caused by
    the project.

•   There is a significant amount of unknowns about the marine organisms, ecosystems and processes
    that DSM mining may impact, as well as the services they provide to human societies, the nature and
    level of the impacts, and how the impacts may change the services. Therefore, it is extremely difficult
    to evaluate these services even qualitatively, let alone quantitatively, as evidenced by the economic

•   Distributional analysis. Like most investment projects, DSM mining projects would impact different
    segments of the host society differently, potentially leading to winners and losers. A distributional
    analysis would identify the winners and losers together with the associated gains and losses, allowing
    the government and project proponent to determine the ways and amount of compensation of the
    losers, should the project go ahead.

Box 5. New Zealand Experience with Ecosystem Impact Assessment

 In New Zealand, in its application for an exploration license, Chatham Rock Phosphate (CRP)
 contended that while the benthic ecosystems in the proposed mining area would be destroyed, (i)
 they weren't that unusual; (ii) were not crucial ecosystems for commercial fish species; and (iii) that
 the overall area that would be lost would be a miniscule proportion of the New Zealand's EEZ. The
 evidence presented by those opposing the project focused partly on (i) the uniqueness of those
 benthic environments; and (ii) their role, i.e. ecosystem services, for various fish species. CRP’s
 inability to counter that evidence or to advance an argument beyond 'it's only a small area'
 contributed to the rejection of their application.

Cost-Benefit Analysis Commissioned by SPC

SPC has commissioned a preliminary economic cost-benefit analysis of DSM mining in the Pacific Island
region. The analysis carried out for three mineral deposits thought to have a high potential for economic
viability: (a) seafloor massive sulphide deposits in Papua New Guinea (PNG); (b) Polymetallic Manganese
Nodules in the Cook islands; and Ferromanganese Cobalt-rich crusts in the Republic of Marshall Islands.
The mining scenario analyzed for (a) reflects the planned Solwara 1 operation, while those for (b) and (c)
are more hypothetical albeit realistic, based on potential operations in these countries. As summarized in
Table 6, the analyses led to the following conclusions: First, in the case of massive sulphide deposits in
PNG, benefits significantly outweigh the costs by $82.7 million (refer to Chapter 3 for more details).
Second, in the case of the Cook Islands, where four metals would be recovered, the miner owns the
operation, and the processing facility would be overseas, net benefits would reach some USD467million,
largely due to the high grades of manganese and other minerals in the nodules. Third, crust mining in the
Marshall Islands would not be economically feasible under the constructed scenarios (SPC, 2016a).

The economic cost-benefit analyses generally followed the principles of good practice listed above.
Specifically, they compared project impacts with the counterfactual, attempted to cover a number of
environmental externalities (see below), differentiated cost and benefits by stakeholder, and used the
host society as the unit of accounting for benefit and cost accrual. They also included ‘regional economic
impact analyses’ to consider distributional impacts or cumulative impacts. On the other hand, they did
not consider impacts on the nations of neighboring EEZs, which may suffer some of the environmental
impacts. Furthermore, the analyses were focused on single projects, thus failing to consider the likely
cumulative impacts of planned series of projects in the same general area.

The authors made a reasoned attempt at analyzing and quantifying some of the possible environmental
externalities. Of the possible impacts identified in SPC (2016b) and summarized in Annex 1, they covered
to a large extent (1) seafloor operations to remove mineralized materials, (2) operational plume and
sediment resuspension at the seafloor by machines, and (3) returned seawater plume under the headings
of ‘mining related disruptions provided by deep seabed communities’ and ‘surface water quality impacts
due to discharge of nutrient rich water’. They also partially evaluated the impact of accidental, non-
routine incidents by focusing on oil spills.

While the approach followed by SPC (2016a) represents an improvement over an earlier attempt by Earth
Economics (2015), there are methodological and coverage related concerns with this analysis too, which
in part point to the difficulty of quantifying impacts which have not or are just beginning to be studied:

•     Arbitrary and unsubstantiated evaluation of the disruptions to the services provided by deep seabed
      communities. The authors first catalogued the services provided by the deep seabed communities at
      each of the mines. Second, they assessed the magnitude of the baseline services by assigning each
      service a level from 1 to 3 relative to service provided by the forest and wetland habitats. For example,
      they assigned “1” to the provisioning service of ‘utilization of genetic resources from deep sea vent
      areas. Third, they evaluated the project related changes by assigning a value between -3 (negative
      impact perceived by most host country residents) and +3 (large positive impact perceived by most
      country residents) and conclude a level of composite service loss. The values assigned in values in
      steps two and three appear rather arbitrary in the absence of any references to relevant scientific
      work.

•     Questionable application of the habitat equivalency analysis (HEA). The authors quantified the
      monetary value of the above service losses on the basis of the total value of services provided by

                                                                                                                  46
    wetlands, using HEA. A key concern with this approach is the validity of comparing deep seabed
    habitats with wetland habitats, given that preference for compensation with the same services as
    were injured (Dunford, 2004). At the same time, literature on deep sea ecosystems already includes
    some studies on willingness to pay for deep sea ecosystem conservation (Box 6); so, one wonders if
    similar valuation studies on proposed DSM mining sites or at least a benefit transfer of the results
    from existing studies might not be more suitable and worth attempting.

Box 6. Valuation of Deep Sea Ecosystems
     •    A 2007 study (Wattage et al., 2011) revealed that the public in Ireland is willing to pay up to
          €10 ($14) per person to protect deep-sea corals from trawling so that the corals can provide
          raw materials for the biomedical industry, essential fish habitats and carbon sinks.
     •    Visitors and residents in the Azores, an Atlantic archipelago about 1,500 kilometres west of
          Portugal, expressed a willingness to pay €405–605 per person (Ressurreição et al, 2011) to
          prevent 10–25% reductions in marine species richness in open waters, including the deep sea.
     •    In Scotland, survey (Jobstvogt et al, 2014) respondents were willing to pay £70 ($115) to £77
          each to promote maximum deep-sea biodiversity conservation and develop new medicinal
          products from deep-sea.
Source: Barbier et al.,2014

•   Questionable estimation of the cost of ecosystem service damage due to accidental oil spills. The
    external cost of accidental oil spills is approximated by the annual premiums for accidental oil spill
    compensation insurance policies. However, these policies would only compensate claimants for
    financial losses. The authors therefore estimate the cost to the host society of losing other ecosystem
    services due to oil spills separately by multiplying the expected oil spill amount by $24,000, a figure
    reported in Kontavas and Psaraftis (2010). The applicability of this damage figure is based on the
    multiplication of a global average financial damage figure estimated a long time ago with an arbitrary
    factor of 1.5, which Kontavas and Psaraftis (2010) themselves question.

•   Omitted possible impacts. The analysis does not cover concerns voiced in several publications (Steiner,
    2009; Rosenbaum 2011; Deep Sea Mining Campaign 2012 and 2015) including the impact of the
    marine food chain, fisheries, and health of communities of accidental spills of toxic minerals and
    return water due to a break in the riser, and of plumes generated by the mining operations, as well
    as possible vessel accidents. A characterization of the services provided by pelagic ecosystems, as the
    authors did for the benthic area, would help analyze these possible impacts.

In sum, while the cost benefit analysis indicates that some cases of DSM mining has high revenue potential
for host countries, the cost of potential losses due to environmental externalities cannot be reliably
estimated in the current limited state of knowledge. This points to a need for more research on how
marine ecosystem services may be impacted by DSM mining and the economic value of changes in such
services.

Step 3. What precautionary measures can be applied?

Six alternative management responses that have been identified:

    1) No development. This option was chosen by the New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency
       (“NZ EPA”) in declining two license applications for exploiting phosphate deposits on the grounds
       that the environmental risks outweigh the economic benefits of the proposed projects and “could
       not be mitigated by any set of conditions or adaptive management regime that might be
       reasonably imposed.” (NZ EPA, 2015) 25. It is noteworthy that the resources in question were not
       DSM, and were shallow and known. Nevertheless, the NZ EPA considered the associated
       environmental risks excessive, suggesting that a DSM mining project with larger uncertainties may
       face equal or more substantial scrutiny.
    2) Set-asides. This option entails setting aside, before any test mining or exploitation occurs, and
       protecting one or more reserve areas that are representative of the habitat that will be impacted,
       also taking into account the possible transboundary nature of some ecosystems (SPC, 2016b). The
       Environmental Management Plan for the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Area provides for nine
       such areas termed “areas of particular environmental interest” (ISA, 2011). The PNG Solwara 1
       Project also plans to use a set aside as a reserve and as a source of fauna specimen with which to
       rehabilitate the project impact zone after the mining operation is completed (Coffey Natural
       Systems, 2008).
    3) Use technological innovation to minimize impacts, such as reduction of the footprint of sediment
       plumes or elimination or mitigate sediment compaction (SPC, 2016b), through the design of riser




25 http://www.epa.govt.nz/news/epa-media-releases/Pages/EPA-refuses-marine-consent-application-by-CRP.aspx.

Accessed on 4 November 2015.
Specifically, in the case of the proposal to mine phosphate nodules on the Chatham Rise, the NZ EPA “concluded
that mining would cause significant and permanent adverse effects on the existing benthic environment on the
Chatham Rise” and was “left with a lack of certainty about the receiving environment and the adverse effects of
the proposal on the environment and existing interests.” Furthermore, the EPA “found that the destructive effects
of the extraction process, coupled with the potentially significant impact of the deposition of sediment on areas
adjacent to the mining blocks and on the wider marine ecosystem, could not be mitigated by any set of conditions
or adaptive management regime that might be reasonably imposed.”

                                                                                                              48
         and pump systems and seafloor crawlers / vehicles. The approved EIA may include an obligation
         to minimize impacts that are understood and can be anticipated or modeled.
     4) Stage a mining proxy, namely an experiment that replicates a DSM operation on an ongoing basis
        but much smaller scale, in order to gather information on the impacts of DSM. Such a proxy would
        require creating environmental impacts, and the amount of useful data produced over a long
        period of time is unknown.
     5) Pilot or trial mining on a small scale, although unlikely to be undertaken due to high cost relative
        to scale, this scenario proposes, as part of a staged program, rather than immediately authorising
        commercial-scale activity (SPC, 2016b). Such pilot mining would be accompanied by extensive
        monitoring before and during the pilot of the mining sites, surrounding areas and control areas.
        The results of such monitoring would allow regulators to halt or substantially change plans for the
        main mining project. The advantage of a trial approach over initiating a full scale DSM project
        right away is the ability to limit the damage to a small area, should one occur. A critical question
        involves the parameters and length of monitoring.
     6) Adaptive management is defined an iterative process of robust decision making in the face of
        uncertainty using monitoring results which help reduce the uncertainty. In a DSM project
        extensive monitoring would be carried out before and during the project of the mining sites,
        surrounding areas and control areas. Monitoring results would lead to amending or improving the
        plan of work, including methods of mitigation, in cases where new information requires changes in
        approach. Complete cancellation of the mining project is also not ruled out, as a result of observed
        results or regulatory non-compliance..26

Step 4. What precautionary measure should be taken?

SPC and NIWA (2016) posits that the best option is to be chosen in the light of (i) capacity issues; (ii)
economic and socio-cultural costs; and (iii) relative risk, and following a deliberative approach consistent
with existing social norms and existing laws. Options (ii) and (iii) will be largely determined on a case by
case manner. However, some general observations on capacity and regulatory issues that will impact the
choice can already be made:

     •   Each of the options requires strong technical capacity on the part of the PIC regulator to evaluate
         the proposed DSM project, including the proposed technology, potential impacts, and mitigation
         measures. Set-asides require the ability to judge the appropriateness of the proposed areas.
         Requiring technological innovations necessitates a sound understanding of impacts and available

  The International Marine Minerals Society’s Code for Environmental Management for Marine Mining (ISA, 2010)
calls for adaptive management under the section heading Integrated Environmental Management: “2. Periodically
review and update the environmental management system in a structured, iterative process that involves the local
or affected community, to ensure that the system remains up-to-date, effective and relevant to the company’s
evolving needs, improvements in best environmental practices, and to changing community values and
expectations.“ (p.12)

                                                                                                             49
         technologies. Mining proxy, trial mining, and adaptive management will require intensive
         monitoring, which the regulator would need to verify and evaluate to decide on the next step.

     •   Investors’ unwillingness to finance may make some options impractical. In the case of a mining
         proxy, it is not clear how such an experiment would be financed since no commercial organization
         would likely be interested in an investment that did not offer the possibility of yielding any
         returns. Similarly, in the case of pilot/trial mining or adaptive management, it is very difficult for
         a company to make an internal or external investment case if there is a reasonable chance they
         might be prohibited from mining some of the resource. 27 This is particularly the case at this very
         early stage of the industry where many of the major players are single project investment vehicles
         – i.e. they exist to develop one major resource, and unlike traditional multinational mining
         companies they cannot offset the high risk of new development against existing producing assets.
         On the other hand, one aspect of DSM that mitigates commercial risk is the ability to move
         equipment and vessels to new resources and areas.

     •   Cost of monitoring. The cost of monitoring, which would be borne by the investor, would be high
         in all five options, but especially in adaptive management.

     •   Regulatory clarity will be needed. In the case of trial mining, regulatory clarity is needed as to
         the grounds on which mining, which has been preceded by pilot or trial operations, could
         nonetheless be rejected. Similar clarity is needed in the case of adaptive management. Moreover,
         there is a general lack of definition of the terms of adaptive management in DSM. Hence, the need
         for “a regulation that better defines adaptive management” is identified as a high level issue by
         the International Seabed Authority in its draft regulatory framework for mineral exploitation in
         the Area (ISA, 2015).28, 29

     •   Lack of baseline data. The New Zealand experience highlighted the difficulty for a company to
         incorporate adaptive management into a DSM license application in the absence of baseline data.




27
   This is different from the common situation governing events that could require terrestrial mining to be halted,
such as mine or damn collapses, pollution events and serious safety breaches. In these cases the legal obligations
are well understood in advance and such incidents relate to well understood baselines and standards.
28
   Under “Commentary / Suggested Content” it notes:
“All actors to adopt an adaptive management approach to exploitation activities. Adaptive management may
include:-
     • The permitting of exploitation operations to proceed on a smaller scale or for shorter defined periods of
     time in order to assess impacts on the environment and on human health and safety;
     • The duration of any approval of an EMP;
     • The frequency of review periods to be imposed by the Authority; and
     • Additional reporting obligations under an EMP.
     • Note: this approach should be balanced with the commercial (economic) viability of operations
29
   Among next steps in the regulatory framework development, the ISA document lists elaboration with interested
parties through a working group and collaboration with the New Zealand Government given its recent regulatory
development and marine consent experience.

                                                                                                                50
Step 5. Implementation and Monitoring

All options will require ongoing data collection including through scientific research on DSM and the
ecosystems it may impact. In the “no-development” option, if the decision rejecting an operation was
made “for the time being, until more information on the risks become available”, there is a need to
continue collecting and assessing data on the risk elements. In the five “development options”, monitoring
would be part of a project environmental management plan based on impacts and risks identified in the
EIA. Impact monitoring would cover the project areas and similar non-project areas to control for
confounding factors. It will also be important not to limit monitoring to the EEZ where a project is located
as impacts may be transboundary or even extend into the Area. In such cases, the regulator needs to
coordinate with the regulators of the neighboring EEZ or the ISA. Moreover, in the case of projects in the
same general area, cumulative impacts need to be considered. Finally, in the set-asides option, the
ecosystems in such sites need to be monitored to ensure that they are not impacted by the DSM
operation. The project proponent should be responsible for funding the implementation of this
monitoring plan. The regulator, in addition to supervising implementation, must verify the data through
independent monitoring, and compile and analyze the data with a view to identifying potential needs for
amending the environmental management plan. This is particularly true under adaptive management.
Monitoring should focus not only on environmental aspects, but also encompass impacts on livelihoods,
other social aspects and cultural values. The regulator must manage an effective grievance mechanism.

Data gathered through the above processes will inform the regulator on the appropriateness of the
current option. For example, in case serious social or environmental risks emerge or the operator
transgresses the license conditions, the regulator may cancel the operation. The regulator will also decide
whether or not to convert a mining proxy or a pilot/trial to a full-scale operation (Table 10.)

Chapter 3. The Case of the Solwara 1 Project 30 31
Being the first DSM mining project in the Pacific to have been granted an exploitation license, the Nautilus
Solwara 1 project in Papua New Guinea (PNG) could move into production in a few years if the mining
company is able to mobilize the necessary capital to complete the build and deployment of the project’s
seafloor production system.32 Solwara 1’s successes and failures have and will continue to shape the wider
global DSM mining industry.

The project envisages extracting high-grade seafloor massive sulphide deposits from an area of 0.11km2
at a depth of approximately 1,600m around 30km off the coast in the Bismarck Sea. The project is very
close to an existing and active seabed volcano - North Su - with resulting sediment plume activity. Solwara
1 is the first of 12 Nautilus projects in the Bismarck Sea with exploration licenses.33 Environmental permits
were granted in 2009 and a mining lease in 2011. The project will use three large seafloor production
tools (large tracked cutting and collecting machines) to mine material that will then be pumped in slurry
form to a surface vessel (Figure 5.)

As outlined in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (Coffey Natural Systems, 2008), the Solwara 1
resource is a seafloor massive sulphide (SMS) deposit in a water depth of between 1,500 to 1,700 meters.
Five mineralised bodies contribute to the estimated 2.6Mt of mineral resource. The resource sits on the
surface of the seafloor and is covered with a thin layer of unconsolidated sediment of varying thickness.
The terrain can be quite steep, with localised gradients of up to 30 degrees.

The three main tasks in the mine operation on the seafloor at Solwara 1 are sediment removal, material
cutting and stockpiling and collection of fragmented mined material. On completion of these activities,
the mined material is to be pumped via the Subsea Slurry Lift Pump to the Production Support Vessel at
the surface. The detailed description of the proposed Solwara 1 development was provided in Chapter 5
of the EIS and remains largely unchanged, including the areas to be mined. As outlined to the PNG
Department of Environment and Conservation in the letter dated June 2010, the original EIS included a
single seafloor mining tool which was to carry out sediment removal, and mined material cutting and
collection. However, as a result of mine methodology optimisation, a revised mine plan has been
developed, which involves the use of three seafloor production tools, consisting of an auxiliary cutter, a

transfer the mined slurry to the production support vessel, as outlined in the original EIS.

Cost Benefit Analysis

Economic costs and Benefis

The economic cost benefit analysis commissioned by SPC (SPC, 2016a) concludes that the benefits of DSM
mining in PNG far outweighs the costs (Table 8). The report also notes that the total monetized social
costs 34 represent a small portion of the monetized social benefits, ultimately having very little impact on
the overall results. The report notes that the following factors contributed to the above findings:

       •    The remote location of the mine site from populated areas (30-40km offshore) when compared
            to land-based mining that often disrupts and/or displaces local communities;

       •    The small footprint of the mine site (0.11 km2) as it relates to the potential for long-term
            environmental impacts and permanent loss of biodiversity;

       •    The advances in technological improvements of SMS mining equipment and processing, allowing
            for efficiency gains and reduced costs of operation;

       •    PNG’s extensive experience in the extractive sector with several “world class” mines that produce
            from some of the most significant deposits of land-based gold, silver and copper in the world has
            allowed it to draw on its experience to write effective frameworks and policies adapted for DSM
            mining and make the development of these deep sea mineral deposits more likely to be accepted
            by the people of PNG; and

       •    Nautilus’ commitment to discourage immigration through its employment policy and its
            commitment to providing assistance to local communities in the form of social programs.

The above estimates should be considered with some caution as the many uncertainties regarding the
environmental and social costs associated with DSM mining are still one of the largest unknowns being
carried forward. As discussed in detail in Chapter 2, the cost benefit analysis has methodological and
coverage issues with regard to such costs. Another aspect is that although the Solwara 1 project is well
advanced from the exploration point of view, the feasibility study was under preparation at the time of

estimates could change the cost and benefit estimates.

Government Interest in Solwara 1

There was an extended legal dispute with the PNG Government regarding its participation in the project
which was resolved in 2014 when the government agreed to buy a 15% share in the project for US$120
million, with options for purchasing a further 15% currently being considered. There are distinct
advantages and disadvantages to the direct interest that the government has in the project. The most
obvious advantage is that a direct stake in the project might allow the government to compensate for the
reduced (compared to traditional mines) onshore benefits from the project. The disadvantages are that it
shares in the commercial risk, and there is some concern that it might compromise the government’s
regulation of the project.

The cost benefit analysis identifies payments made to the PNG government as the primary benefit of DSM
mining from the perspective of the PNG citizens. With the exception of monitoring and regulatory costs,
considered small, all other revenues would be available to the PNG government. The current Mining Act
is being revised to address DSM mining activities. In addition, Nautilus has also established a Community
Development Fund, where approximately $0.75 (USD) per ton of ore mined will be placed into a fund used
to support health and education projects in other PNG provinces.

Environmental Impact Assessment 35

Process. In compliance with the PNG Environment Act 2000, in 2008, Nautilus issued an environmental
impact statement (EIS) based on oceanography, biology, chemistry, water quality and sedimentation rate
studies in the Bismarck Sea during from 2006 and 2008 (Coffey Natural Systems, 2008). 36 The EIS
consisted of an executive summary, a main report (Volume A) and 15 appendices (Volume B) with
supporting studies (Annex 3).37 More than 34 independent studies were published by scientists who have
worked on the Solwara 1, South Su, and North Su sites, the three areas that comprise the mining lease for
the Solwara 1 Project (Annex 3), mainly focusing on baseline characterization. The EIS states that “…
consultations with governments, regional communities in East New Britain and New Ireland Provinces,
and offshore resource users have been followed throughout to ensure awareness of the fundamentals of
the Project, particularly those that differentiate it from other projects, and to promote the forum for
raising and receiving responses to concerns and developing strategies to minimize any impacts.” 38

Steiner (2009) conducted an independent review of the EIS at the request of the Bismarck-Solomon Seas
Indigenous Peoples Council. However, at the time of his review Volume B had not been made available to
the public, which prevented him from reviewing the supporting studies and led him to judge the EIS as
“not fit-to-purpose”, as “[m]any risk contingencies are poorly analyzed, some are not analyzed at all, and
many of the baseline studies necessary to understand potential impacts have yet to be completed”.39 The
Government of PNG reportedly also commissioned an independent review of the EIS; however, as of the
writing of this report it had not been made publicly available. In 2009, the Government, under the
Environment Act 2000 issued an environmental permit40 to carry out the Solwara 1 project for a term of
25 years, pending the preparation of an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) (see
below). Criticism of the EIS process centered on transparency. It was noted that procedural requirements
regarding public consultations were not followed and the independent review of the EIS commissioned
by the Government has not been disclosed (Rosenbaum, 2011.)

Content. The EIS (Environmental Impact Statement, Coffey Natural Systems 2008) discusses likely impacts
of Solwara 1 and presents mitigation measures. Annex 1 of the present report summarizes the offshore
impacts and proposed mitigation measures applying the framework developed by SPC (2016b). Among
the key points, the EIS recognizes that the seafloor operations “will directly remove seafloor substrate,
including active and inactive areas, causing loss of habitat and associated animals” 41 . The mitigation

   According to the PNG Environment Act (2000) section 51, the term “Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)”
refers to a report, while “Environmental Impact Assessment” refers to a process encompassing (a) submission of
an inception report which set out the proposed issues to be covered in the EIS; (b) submission of an EIS which sets
out the environmental impacts which are likely to result from the carrying out of the activity; (c) assessment and
public review of the EIS; and (d) acceptance of the EIS by the Director of Environment.

measures proposed include “protection (from current mining) of a nearby reference area at South Su, the
retention of temporary unmined refuge areas within Solwara 1, and the enhancement of recolonisation
by translocation of animal communities from areas about to be mined to areas where mining is
complete” 42 . Critics of these proposals have pointed to incomplete understanding of the species
composition in the mining site and the reserve site, especially regarding meiofauna, and the untested
nature of the proposed measures (Rosenbaum, 2011; IUCN Pacific Center for Environmental Governance,
authors’ communication). With regard to plumes and sediments generated at the mine site and by the
returned seawater, the EIS points to limited impact, in particular due to release of the returned seawater
at the bottom of the sea. Critics have pointed out that impact on South Su could not be excluded and also
warned of toxic impact of both types of plumes on the food chain in the ocean, including on fisheries
which could have public health impacts for the coastal communities and lead to commercial losses in the
case of tune fisheries (Rosenbaum, 2011; Deep Sea Mining Campaign, 2012). According to Nautilus, the
new studies it has commissioned rule out such impacts. However, these studies have not been disclosed
to the public yet. 43

Additional Studies. Nautilus commissioned a number of scientific studies in 2015 in order to consolidate
its understanding of the baseline environment at Solwara 1, and in response to continued concerns raised
by stakeholders, primarily at the community level in the provinces of Papua New Guinea. These studies
are carried out by a team of external scientists and, as per information provided by Nautilus in June 2016
(authors’ communication), were to be finalized in late 2016: 44

     •   Comprehensive analysis of the existing seafloor noise, and an assessment of the likely impacts to
         all marine fauna as a result of project operations;
     •   Baseline study of the heavy metals concentrations in existing fish stocks (using fish tissue analysis)
         in the Manus region (at the Project site, and along coastlines);
     •   Baseline study of the health and function of existing coral reef systems in the East New Britain
         and New Ireland provinces;

   Nautilus informed the authors that in 2015 it commissioned Earth Economics to conduct a comprehensive
compliance audit of the proposed Solwara 1 project against environmental and social performance standards, as
well as environmental, health and safety guidelines used by organizations within the World Bank Group. The audit
reviewed the Solwara 1 Project against the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on
Environmental and Social Sustainability (2012); the IFC Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines for Mining
(2007), for Offshore Oil and Gas Development (2007); and for Shipping (2007); and the World Bank Environmental
and Social Framework (2015 – second draft for consultation). The audit found that Nautilus either meets, or has
documented plans to meet before mining commences, all applicable IFC performance standards and guidelines as
well as World Bank standards. The audit also indicated that in some areas Nautilus has set a higher bar than IFC
guidelines, and has established examples of good industry practice that may further improve industry standards in
future. Nautilus aims to have the Solwara 1 Project reassessed following commencement of mining to confirm
ongoing compliance throughout operations with these extremely rigorous voluntary standards (Authors’
communication with Nautilus.)

                                                                                                              57
        •   Further comprehensive water quality and sedimentation data collection to provide long term
            baseline data that adequately captures the variability of the site, due to the influence of
            hydrothermal activities and the active North Su volcano.

A subsequent study of impacts on fisheries. The Solwara 1 EIS (Appendices 10, 11, 12 and 13) contains
information about the Solwara 1 Project that is relevant to the fisheries industry. In addition to these
data, Nautilus has updated its sediment plume modelling to reflect updated baseline information on the
naturally occurring sedimentation processes (associated with the North Su volcano), as well as some
amendments to the project design, engineering, and mine design. This updated modelling was to be
finalized and made public by late 2016. 45 Nautilus remains confident that it will have no impact on
fisheries industries or any nearshore environments, including coral reefs (Author’s communication with
Nautilus in June 2016).

Preparation of the EMMP. The Solwara 1 Project Environment Permit requires the development of an
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) by Nautilus, for approval by the Conservation
and Environmental Protection Authority (CEPA) prior to the commencement of mining. The Permit
required that the EMMP include 12 sub-plans46 and a risk assessment. Nautilus commenced the process
of EMMP drafting with a workshop in 2011 at which 15 independent scientists and five PNG government
representatives met to discuss the potential management strategies that should be considered for the
Solwara 1 Project. This workshop was the beginning of a long history of stakeholder engagement, in which
Nautilus canvassed the views of independent experts in order to propose a set of management strategies
that most effectively implemented adaptive management strategies and the precautionary principle
(authors’ communication with Nautilus).

The EMMP and 12 supporting Sub-Plans as of June 2016 remained in draft, and were being finalized
through a formal process of engagement with CEPA, the National Fisheries Authority, the National
Maritime Safety Authority, and the Minerals Resource Authority in PNG. Once the plans are finalized they
will be subject to independent expert review, a process that is commissioned and owned by CEPA in order
to maintain transparency and independence. Following this process (and subject to any required
amendments), the documents will be accepted by CEPA for the formal review and approval process
(authors’ communication with Nautilus, 2016).

Once the EMMP and sub-plans are approved, Nautilus may commence mining. During mining,
environmental monitoring will occur as part of all operational activities, as outlined in the Monitoring Plan
(a sub-plan to the EMMP). The environmental monitoring reports generated as part of operational
monitoring will be made publicly available throughout the Solwara 1 Project life, and will be independently

and 12 sub-plans every six months during operations, to formally capture adaptive management
processes. These updated documents will be formally submitted to CEPA every 6 months during
operations, in line with the requirements of the Environment Permit.

Critics of the EIS principally cited insufficient treatment of damage to highly valuable endemic benthic 47
fauna, for which discovery of additional species is possible; impact on pelagic (water column) fauna; risks
of leakage from the riser or discharge pipes and of spills from the Mining Support Vessel, shuttle barges
to Rabaul or ore freighters from Rabaul; vertical and horizontal currents transporting sediment plumes
and pollutants shorewards and into contact with marine food chains; impact on fisheries and other
livelihoods; and cumulative impacts. (Steiner, 2009; Ocean Foundation, 2015).

Lessons learnt to date48

    •    The importance of timely publishing of documents cannot be overstated. While Nautilus has a
         strong history of transparency and data sharing, the internal review process can be time
         consuming, and it is important to balance the processes of transparent data-sharing and rigorous
         data review.
    •    Nautilus acknowledges the benefit of the independent external review process, and welcomes
         the opportunity for those reviews to be made public, to further enhance the transparency of the
         process.
    •    The benefits of engaging with external stakeholders, and in particular regulators, throughout the
         permitting and operations phases cannot be overstated. Engaging with government agencies
         includes regulatory bodies (such as CEPA) but also with other interested parties such as the
         provincial governments, and agencies such as the National Fisheries Authority, to ensure that all
         government stakeholders are recognised and able to provide timely feedback and input to the
         project.

The process for protecting set-asides or reserve areas, after mining is complete, remains an outstanding
issue, that may warrant further discussion. At present, the Solwara 1 set-aside, the “South Su” area, is
protected by Nautilus’ commitment to maintain it as a reserve area (in the Solwara 1 EIS), and the fact the
Regulator must authorise any significant changes from the approved mine plan. It is also protected from
parallel exploitation by another company as it is located on the Solwara 1 mining lease and therefore
cannot be accessed by any other resource company. However, at the conclusion of mining and
relinquishment of the Solwara 1 lease, an alternative protection method (such as a Marine Protected
Area) may warrant consideration.

Chapter 4. Establishing DSM Sector Governance
Need for Long-range DSM Sector Planning

The economic contribution from mining is highly varied across countries, and negative outcomes have
resulted from governments failing to convert mineral endowment into sustained forms of sustained
economic activity. The quality of mining sector governance is paramount in this regard.49 In summarizing
lessons learned for mining resource rich nations, the IMF notes that key requirements that strengthen
sector governance include:

        • Good management to ensure efficient and effective exploitation;
        • Good tax design to ensure appropriate government revenue and adequate incentives for
        investors;
        • Good revenue administration to ensure that revenue is collected in practice; and
        • Good public expenditure management to ensure that volatile and temporary natural resource
        revenue translates to permanent benefits for the nation and to manage the risk resource wealth
        poses to the wider economy.

There is a global experience that modest mining revenues that are well managed lead to larger
development outcomes, than larger revenue streams that are poorly managed. At the core of this
challenge is that few countries have a comprehensive governance strategy for effective natural resource
management, owing to a fragmentation of stakeholder views limited by incomplete information (gaps)
regarding the underlying resource endowment.

There is a growing recognition that public sector governance may well be the key determinant of the
extent to which any one mine is economically, politically, socially, and environmentally viable. Where
governance is weak or incomplete, instability and lack of predictability too often prevail and result in
conditions of heightened risk and uncertainty for all. Mining investors require stability / predictability of
financial and economic policies, and a transparent non-discretionary implementation of laws and
regulations. Given an array of technical, commercial, and political risks; mining is high-risk / high-reward
and financial gains and losses are both highly volatile and cyclical. Moreover, environmental / social /
economic performance standards have become a core prerequisite for achieving sustainable outcomes,
together with new demands regarding “shared value” that leverage mining investments to align with
public sector development plans and ensure sharing of benefits with those most affected by mineral
industries.

This interdependence between public sector performance and private sector risk is well known to
investors. A 2015 World Bank compendium of industry perspectives and outlooks underscore the
challenges facing the mining sector within emerging economies:


49 Ata general level, many conceive of mineral sector governance as a series of questions: what the basic rules are
that guide activities within a specified society; how these rules are implemented, monitored, and enforced; and
who determines the rules and how this authority is conferred and employed?

                                                                                                                60
    •   Governance. Following the financial crisis of 2008, the mining industry is emphasizing a need for
        good sector governance in order to access scarce investment capital. Those nations offering
        higher levels of sector governance offer greater stability / predictability to investors.
    •   Social License to operate. Earning the social license to operate through inclusive growth
        processes and increased benefits sharing is essential. This requires improved revenue
        mobilization and tax administration by the public sector. As a part of this challenge, there is a
        need for increased “shared Value” to address the underlying root causes of community concerns
        and unlocks economic opportunities for companies in the extractives sector. Key opportunities
        include (a) the sharing of mutually beneficial infrastructure, (b) policies for local content to
        improve local workforce, suppliers and community health, and (c) creating the enabling
        environment for local cluster development, local infrastructure networks, and playing an active
        role in regional & community development. Shared value initiatives align private and public sector
        investments towards common goals.
    •   Integrated landscape management. Over the past decade there has been an increased
        appreciation of the importance of integrated spatial / temporal planning, recognizing that mines
        exist within complex landscapes having many other complementary and non-complementary
        uses. Moreover, the intersection of mining and its associated infrastructure with water and forest
        resources is a leading source of negative impact, and an area where integrated management can
        help to address the impacts of climate change.

Deep Sea Mining, like surface mining, has a number of unique characteristics that influence fiscal policy
design and tax design and administration. These include:

    •   Mineral resources are a valuable nonrenewable national asset, and governments expend much
        capital to assess the total resource endowment to understand (a) the full resource potential and
        (b) how any one mine development is impacting the depletion of this national asset.
    •   The profitability of a mining operation can vary significantly with changes in commodity prices,
        production costs, and fiscal policy.
    •   The industry has long been characterized as high risk / high reward, requiring large capital
        investments backed by strong technological expertise.
    •   In lower-income countries most of the natural resources produced are exported, and most of the
        high-value equipment and services used for natural resource operations are imported.
    •   Natural resource companies often operate under distinctive risk-sharing commercial
        arrangements.
    •   Transfer of ownership of interests in natural resource operations is common.
    •   Natural resources present exceptional challenges to governance and transparency.

Need for Quantitative Resource Assessment
However, Deep Sea Mining carries a one unique characteristic – an inability by PIC governments to
conduct a resource assessment of the broader mineral endowment in order to inform on the design of an
appropriate fiscal policy, and understanding of economic potential. The current understanding of


                                                                                                      61
resource potential comes from a very small number of blocks (1-2) for which Bankable Feasibility Studies
have been submitted and are available. It is not known where these first deposits are located upon the
full spectrum of possible deposit sizes and qualities, and thus the potential size of the next “discovery”
and the corresponding potential economic contribution.

The resulting information gaps extend physically across an area much larger than the proposed mining
operation itself, and the provision of information to address these gaps may have to come from a
partnership with those companies exploring the seafloor itself. Application of the Precautionary Approach
for mitigating and managing environmental / social impacts may be useful in this regard, serving as a
framework for approaching the economic resource potential – in that different options under the
Precautionary Approach could include alternative incentives and obligations for the company to provide
such data.

Need for DSM -Driven Local Content
Decades of practical experience in capturing the economic impacts & linkages of mining highlight the
existence of limited spillover effects in developing countries. Mining enclaves having few local linkages,
result from the use of specialized input, often at the high end of the technology spectrum, sourced
through globally integrated supply chains or global value chains. This is a DSM challenge given technology-
intensive methodologies from a concentration of suppliers, many of whom may more commonly service
offshore hydrocarbon exploration and development.

Policy interventions to strengthen economic linkages often taken the form of local content requirements,
local ownership requirements, local processing standards, local hiring of staff, compulsory corporate
social responsibility (CSR) programs, mandatory local content reporting requirements and supplier
development programs among other (Hirschman, 1958, Kokko, 1994; UNCTAD, 2001; and Alfaro et al.,
2010). Today, ninety-percent of all resource rich countries have policies or regulations related to
promoting local content from extractive industry FDI, ranging from harder, and targeted requirements to
softer approaches (Dobbs et al., 2014). Although these policies were designed to correct for enclave
development, their application has achieved mixed results.

In approaching DSM mining, some useful lessons can be learned from the experience of other countries,
policies and implementing tools aimed at developing productive linkages are context-specific – again
aligned with the foundational premise of achieving “shared-value” combing the lessons of Porter et al.
(2013) and the World Bank (2016).

       What types of DSM policies can be used to guide investment while increasing local linkages in
        PIC’s? Do they differ across the region?
       What are the costs and benefits of introducing such policies, and how can this best be determined
        for potential DSM investors, PIC governments, and the society as a whole?
       How can the implementation of such policies be measured and monitored and the national level
        and through regional cooperation?



                                                                                                       62
       What kind of technological and knowledge spillovers are more easily transferred to the PIC’s?
        How would they be measured?
       What exactly is “shared-value” in the context of DSM in PIC’s?

PIC governments will want to catalyze their position as owner of the mineral resources to leverage new
collaborative partnerships around shared-value by aligning private sector DSM investments and public
sector investments targeting poverty reduction and increased shared prosperity. Creating “shared value”
within PIC’s goes well beyond contractual / regulatory compliance challenges within PICs towards
developing strategies for that deliver tangible social benefits. Figure 7 below was created by the World
Bank to depict several interrelated issues around shared value and sustainable development for mining.
As applied to DSM, PIC governments would want to move beyond narrow definitions of policy and
regulatory compliance (on the left side of the diagram), towards the strengthening of economic linkages
(local content) through integrated planning, benefits that target community, and the sharing of
infrastructure (which for DSM might relate to marine infrastructure and information technology systems
to improve connectivity).

And, in approaching DSM it is equally important to understand what potential investors might need / want
from governments. While no survey has been taken of potential DSM investors, the World Bank for many
years did conduct surveys of terrestrial mining companies in emerging economies. Table 10 below
underscores the key elements of predictability, stability, and consistency of policy and decision making

                                                                                                    63
processes. Any poor practices that erode the enforcement of a competitive, transparent non-discretionary
regime – serve to directly erode the viability of the investment, and PIC governments will want to
safeguard against poor practices.

Need to Grow Industry
The mining industry in a new country is often stimulated by one exceptionally large or rich discovery. In
the context of DSM, this might be a particular PIC licensing a single operation and the industry using that
opportunity to “learn” how to better optimize production technologies and exploration to improve
operational efficiencies. A second operation might then be begun, and one-by-one clusters of mining
operations emerge. As such, the economic impact of DSM ten-to-fifteen years into the future could be
more robust, making modelling of potential revenue streams all the more difficult absent a sense of the
rate of learning associated with DSM.
Likewise, it is the experience in many countries having undergone World Bank supported reforms that
governance also improves in incremental stages and the rate of improvement of sector governance ten-
to-fifteen years into the future could also be appreciably different (most often improving in non-linear
fashion). This learning by industry and government alike leads to some conceptual curves used by the
World Bank to convey that reforms and concurrent sector activity (exploration and exploitation) take time
to germinate, but once having achieved initial levels of efficiencies, can have marked further


                                                                                                         64
improvements thereafter (see Figure 8). It is not known if DSM would replicate the experience of
terrestrial mining, only that incremental rates of increase through learning should be expected.

Term Investments and Sector Growth

In summary, DSM will be an industry that undergoes learning, recognizing that the process has begun and
there is need to signal / prepare governments for this process. The challenge is to systematically build
capacity to (a) collect new data that informs upon the ecological situation, (b) where potential problems
lie, (c) how to address administrative and fiscal management deficiencies of government, including policy
and regulatory development, and (d) introduce effective environmental safeguards. And in this regard,
time is not always on a government’s side.

Fiscal Considerations

As with terrestrial mineral deposits, a commercial company will want to proceed with mining at sea when
there is the prospect that the value of minerals produced will exceed the costs of finding and exploiting
those minerals at least enough to cover the costs of capital invested. However, unlike terrestrial mineral
deposits far less is known about the costs of finding and exploiting deep seabed deposits. Nor have enough
data been collected to know the economics of the “average” deep seabed deposit or to predict the
frequency of above and below average deposits. This is a challenge for both the investor and the
Government, which hopes to capture a portion of any profits made.


                                                                                                      65
The repercussions of these unknowns for the design of a fiscal regime may be summarized as follows:

   •   It will be especially hard to determine in advance how profitable mining will be, at least in the
       initial stages of development of DSM. Fiscal terms fixed in advance could turn out to be entirely
       unbalanced, favoring one side or the other far too much. Indeed, if terms were left to negotiation,
       the high level of uncertainty and risks borne by the investor would likely lead to the Government
       having to make large concessions to secure any investment. If, later on, it turned out that mining
       could in fact be done very profitably, the Government would not be in a position to share in those
       benefits, except by reneging on the agreement and changing terms in its favor. This problem,
       which is encountered in terrestrial mining as well, will be especially acute for DSM until the sector
       has matured.

   •   These circumstances would tend to favor flexible fiscal regimes, in which the share in profits
       obtained by the investor and the Government would vary in proportion to the level of profits
       made (ex-post). This means that if profitability turns out to be greater than thought at the time
       of the investment, the upside would be shared and not benefit the mining company alone.

   •   In its purest form, a resource rent tax, such flexibility will, however, tend to mean that fiscal
       receipts will be back-end loaded to allow investment recovery to take place first. In addition, by
       linking fiscal receipts so closely to profitability, revenue flows would be more likely to match the
       highly cyclical and volatile nature of mineral commodity markets. Whereas a large and diversified
       economy could probably absorb erratic revenues from mining, that will not be the case in small
       mineral-dependent economies.

   •   Some governments in the region may see DSM as an opportunity to generate windfall revenue,
       even as early as when awarding rights to explore for exploit deep seabed minerals, through a
       system of cash bonus bidding, such as is commonly used in the oil industry. However, this is
       unlikely to be a viable approach so long as commercial risks remain very high and only a small
       field of players exist.

   •   Similarly, some governments may wish to participate financially in DSM, to gain direct access to
       profits. However, it should be recognized that such equity participation would be placing public
       funds in the riskiest of all mining ventures. Governments could be better off limiting or eliminating
       downside risks, while retaining an opportunity to participate in any upside through a resource
       rent tax.

   •   There will undoubtedly be considerable pressure on Governments to offer fiscal incentives to
       investors in DSM on the grounds of the high risk and the “pioneer” character of DSM projects.
       Fiscal incentives are only justifiable if the counter-factual is no investment at all or if the incentives
       generate non-fiscal benefits (i.e. additional jobs, additional infrastructure) that justify the tax
       revenue foregone. Because of the new nature of DSM, Governments may be poorly placed to
       assess the counter-factual and unless incentive systems are very well defined and monitored, they
       can be open to abuse, denying Governments badly needed revenues.




                                                                                                             66
•   There is also likely to be pressure from investors to receive fiscal stabilization assurance for the
    same reason that DSM projects are high risk and the investor is acting as a pioneer. Companies
    will want to protect themselves from any temptation the Government may later have to renege
    on the fiscal terms to the disadvantage of the company. Care should be taken to limit the
    application of such stability assurances in terms of both duration and scope.

Chapter 5. Regulatory and Institutional Gap Analysis
The management of DSM mining in a fiscally, environmentally, and socially responsible manner in line
with the Precautionary Approach requires a sophisticated regulatory regime and highly specialized
technical expertise. This chapter reviews the existence of legislation to regulate the DSM industry and the
institutional capacity to implement it, in the PICs. An in-depth review of the content of the legislation or
the national consultative process by which each PIC adopts such legislation, however, is beyond the scope
of this study.

Regulatory framework. As of June 2016, of the fifteen PICs five, namely Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, Tonga
and Tuvalu had legislation in place that covered DSM specific issues. In six countries, namely FSM, Kiribati,
Republic of Marshall Islands, Niue, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, draft DSM legislation prepared under
the SPC-EU DSM project was at various stages of processing for enactment. Separately, in Papua New
Guinea, a review of the mining laws and the national minerals policy currently is in progress and will result
in the revision of the mining laws to include DSM. In Vanuatu, a DSM policy has been completed and
submitted to cabinet for adoption. A new DSM law is drafted by SPC (Table 9). 50 A number of regional
frameworks (i.e. legislative and regulatory framework; financial framework; environmental framework;
and scientific research guidelines) have been prepared by the SPC-EU DSM Project for information and
use by PICs as a guide to develop similar national frameworks.

The SPC has laid out the main elements of a regulatory regime that embodies and supports the application
of the Precautionary Approach in dealing with the environmental and social impacts and risks of DSM
(SPC, ND; SPC, 2016b). Whether a self-standing DSM legislation or as part of a more general existing
legislation on mining, the legislation and associated regulations would need to clearly define i) the
requirements for assessing and documenting the environmental and social impacts and risks associated
with the proposed DSM project, at each stage of the project, including prospecting, exploration,
exploitation, closing, and post-exploitation; ii) monitoring and compliance requirements, and iii)
transparent and enforceable procedures, including public participation, at each step, and a grievance
mechanism. As such, the proposed regulatory regime is in line with the key requirements of UNCLOS and
the World Bank Group Safeguards Policies and Standards summarized in Table 10.

Institutional capacity. Specialized technical capacity of government personnel dealing with DSM issues is
limited at best in most PICs (Table 9). While no systemic analysis of environmental management capacity
with regard to DSM has been carried out, it is likely also very limited in most countries. Under the SPC-
EU DSM Project, SPC facilitated the establishment of national offshore minerals committees, which are
tasked with facilitating and/or reviewing of DSM policy and laws and conducting awareness programs,
among others. To address technical capacity shortages, the said project also sponsored training
workshops, internships, conference attendance, and short-term attachments. However, the sustainability



50 Bol&PANG   (2016) maintains that in some PICs DSM legislation drafted with support from the SPC is inadequate
in terms of coverage of provision on indigenous or human rights and environmental protection, and that the
national review process has lacked in community consultation.

                                                                                                              68
of the capacity thus built is questionable as qualified and experienced professionals tend to join the
private sector and regional organizations or migrate to countries such as Australia and New Zealand.51




51 Thecontinuation of these capacity building programmes is uncertain with the ending of the SPC-EU DSM Project
on 31st Dec 2016.

specific regulatory functions with regards to environmental and social risk management that PIC
governments would need to carry out under the Precautionary Approach. The assessment takes into

Costs. The administrative costs of adequate regulation of DSM mining operations are high. SPC (2016a)
estimates the annual recurrent expenditures for monitoring and reporting on a single DSM mining activity
in PNG at US$205, 000, as detailed in Table 14. The estimates provide a useful ballpark figure, while one
must keep in mind the large variation among the PICs in terms of key cost determinants, including the
extent of DSM resources, their distances from the capital city, and general wage levels.

DSM Management in the Area

The International Seabed Authority (“ISA” or “the Authority”) administers the Area in accordance with the
1992 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and its 1994 Implementing Agreement
relating to the deep seabed mining. Within this general legal framework, ISA issues rules, regulations and
procedures, the totality of which is referred to as the “Mining Code”.

ISA has Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area (adopted 13 July
2000) which was later updated and adopted 25 July 2013; the Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration
for Polymetallic Sulphides in the Area (adopted 7 May 2010) and the Regulations on Prospecting and
Exploration for Cobalt-Rich Crusts (adopted 27 July 2012).55 In 2011, the Authority’s Legal and Technical
Commission issued an environmental management plan for the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (ISA, 2011).

The Authority is in the process of developing regulations on exploitation of mineral resources in the Area.
In July 2015, the Authority issued a working draft of exploitation regulations for comments until
Novermber 25, 2016. Key issues of discussion during the drafting of the regulations concern dispute
resolution, data and information management, communications and engagement of stakheolders, and

duties and travel, 6 workers are required to ensure 100% at-sea coverage. Lower at-sea coverage requirements
would reduce the number of staff neded.
53
   Even without onshore processing, DSM mining would be a large part of the economy. This is a fairly skilled
employee who makes sure payments are received in a timely manner and funds are dispersed to coastal residents in
a manner consistent with laws and policies. It is envisioned as a full-time position with a salary bracket in the top
10% of income distributions.
54
   This position would be considered entry-level in the U.S. and requires an employee who would be responsible
for monitoring contractor performance for compliance with applicable laws, delivery schedules, payment
provisions, inspections, contract and date reporting requirements. Salary is based on similar job posted by the
U.S.     government      for    a    contract     administrator     for    the     Department       of   Defense

Chapter 6. Some Concluding Thoughts on Where Regional
Cooperation needs to be strengthened
For any Pacific Island country that is considering to derive economic benefits from deep sea minerals in
its EEZ in a fiscally, environmentally, and socially responsible manner following the Precautionary
Approach, the cost of regulatory measures is high. Meeting the demands for specialized expertise and
equipment is a significant challenge for most PICs given limited national budgets and populations.
Recognizing these challenges, PICs have voiced growing interest in formalized regional cooperation in
regulating DSM building on the ongoing current collaboration under the auspices of the SPC-EU DSM
Project (“Current Situation”) and following the existing regional cooperation arrangements for the
management of fisheries (Box 6).

Box 8. Existing Regional Modes of Cooperation for managing the Resources of the Pacific

 •   The Framework for a Pacific Oceanscape (2010) is a framework for policy implementation to
     better understand and conserve the Pacific Ocean in support of the Pacific Plan’s (2005) key
     objective of ensuring the health of the Pacific Ocean and the fisheries resources it supports. The
     Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat houses an Oceanscape Unit responsible for monitoring
     implementation of the Framework while the Pacific Islands Fisheries Agency provides direct
     oceanic (tuna) fisheries management, development and compliance services to the Forum’s
     member countries. The Pacific Community provides coastal fisheries science, management and
     development services to its members, together with the oceanic scientific research.

 •   The Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common
     Interest (“ The Nauru Agreement”) signed in 1982 by 8 PICs, namely the Federated States of
     Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and
     Tuvalu, who collectively control 25–30% of the world's tuna supply and approximately 60% of the
     western and central Pacific tuna supply. The ‘Parties to the ‘Nauru Agreement’ (PNA) aim to
     improve regional conservation measures and financial returns from foreign vessels operating
     within their EEZs. To this end, the PNA have developed a vessel day scheme as a specific system
     for collective action to manage the shared purse seine fishery within their waters, which is
     administered by the PNA Office based in Majuro.

 •   The oceanic fishing activities occurring on the high seas neighboring the waters of some PICs are
     managed collectively by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission established under
     the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.


Caution should be exercised however, when considering the fisheries regime as a model for cooperation
on DSM because of several, important differences between DSM and fisheries. First, the fisheries regime
under the Nauru Agreement aims to optimize revenue and benefits to PICs from an activity that is already
fully developed. Second, as a shared renewable resource, fish provide a greater incentive to cooperate

                                                                                                          78
since one country’s unsustainable actions damaging the stock would affect all other countries. Therefore,
a common position in negotiations benefits all.

Possible Cooperation Arrangements

Current Situation

As detailed in Tables 14.1 and 14.2 below, under the Current Situation, the PICs cooperate with SPC on
general regulatory functions (items 1-3 on Table 14.1); however, PIC governments carry out all specific
project-related measures (items 4-6). The latter include scoping, reviewing and approving environmental
and social assessments; selecting an appropriate Precautionary Approach option, including possibly ‘no
development’; supervising and enforcing the agreed environmental management regime under the
selected option. However, given their current capacity and resources, most PICs are not in a position to
perform most of the project-specific regulatory functions. SPC has provided technical assistance or to
national regulators in some areas. Specifically, SPC provides technical and legal advice on the pros and
cons of each option, while the decision of the appropriate Precautionary Approach option rests with
sovereign states.

Possible Alternative Scenarios

Two scenarios replacing the Current Situation have been identified. The first alternative may be the
establishment of a Regional Technical Service Provider which would build on and expand SPC’s current

                                                                                                              79
function. More concretely, as detailed in Table 14.2, the Regional Technical Service Provider would
manage or supervise all technical activities and provide advice to the national authorities on the choice of
the appropriate Precautionary Approach option, on enforcement decisions in case of transgressions in the
chosen option, and on questions regarding conversion of a mining proxy or trial operation to a full-scale
(adaptive management). The decision making authority on these questions would rest with PIC national
governments. Shifting the technical aspects of DSM regulation to a competent regional body, would
drastically reduce the demands on national institutions. The Regional Technical Service Provider may also
engage in capacity building capacity on DSM issues among decision makers.

The second alternative may entail a regional regulator, which would have not only the technical
competency to carry out all technical functions listed above, but also the authority to make and implement
decisions on enforcement matters, and choice of Precautionary Approach option, including conversion
from proxy or trial to adaptive management or termination of an operation. The regional regulator would
act on behalf of the sovereign states and be supervised by an advisory council.

The specific mandate and terms of reference of this regional body would be determined by the Pacific
Leaders within the existing regional cooperation structure. The regional body, should Pacific Leaders
decide to establish it, would need to be in operation for at least a decade for continuity in services. It is
also important to note that regardless of the mandate chosen, a national DSM position needs to be in-
build to work closely with the agency responsible for DSM in-country to ensure effective implementation
of activities, or otherwise current capacity limitations within ministries can cause prolonged delays due to
possible divergent priorities and staff movement.

While the establishment of a regional body, whether a technical service provider or regulator, would be
much more efficient and effective, than individual PICs building up regulatory capacity, a critical question
concerns the source of funding. It would seem natural and consistent with the polluter pays principle to
suggest that the regional body be funded by companies licensed to carry out prospecting and to larger
degree by companies licensed for exploration and exploitation. The “taxing” of companies at the
exploration stage makes sense given that a large number of critical regulatory functions, including the
social and environmental assessments and decisions on the Precautionary Approach option take place
during the exploration phase, as discussed before.

Caution needs to be exercised on possible conflict of interest regarding a regional body, in particular and
a regional regulator. If the raison d’etre of such a regulator is to help develop DSM and if it is funded
through fees paid by mining companies, it may find itself torn between two motivations, one to make a
mining operation happen on the one hand and to exercise the Precautionary Approach to its fullest extent,
including not going ahead with / terminating a DSM exploitation project.

                           Lights attached to the machines on the seafloor will introduce light into an environment that is otherwise without light except for bioluminescence, if present.
                           These lights may repel or attract some organisms, and could blind some species, if they have the ability to see (which may not be the case in an environment
                           which is perpetually dark). In particular, lighting will interfere with biotic communications / interactions mediated by bioluminescence, if that method of

                           Noise and vibration may also attract or repel some organisms and, if significant enough, could cause masking effects on marine mammals that use similar
                           frequencies for communication, / navigation, prey detection and predator avoidance. Vibration may cause responses in other faunal types.

                           Plumes of suspended sediment may smother/bury seabed organisms and hard substrates, disorient and choke motile organisms and suspension feeders, and
                           dilute the layers of organic matter at the sediment-water interface (food for deposit feeders). Resuspended sediments have a low nutritional quality for
                           sediment feeders and may clog the filtering apparatus of pelagic organisms. Additional sedimentation may impact the ability of larvae to feed in the water
                           column or to settle on hard or soft substrates (e.g., by burying substrates and obscuring chemical settling cues). Metals, if they are associated with plumes,
                           may become bioavailable – the potential for toxicity and bioaccumulation needs to be assessed and will likely vary with mineral type.
                           Plumes may spread to areas outside the direct mining site, and will have a gradient of impact, reducing with distance from the activity. The extent of plumes
                           will depend on the mineral type, the amount of sediment that is disturbed during the mining process, the mining process used and water current speed and
                           direction.

                                                                                   accumulate over time and extend over larger areas.
                           The seawater that is recovered with the mineralised material will need to be returned to the ocean. The volume returned seawater plume will be dependent
                           on the recovery technology and is unlikely to be as heavily loaded with suspended sediments as the operational plume. Compared to the surrounding water it
                           is released into, it is likely to contain different characteristics such as: temperature, dissolved minerals (including heavy metals), salinity, suspended sediment
                           etc.
                           Due to the removal of the mineralised material from the seawater, surface water may need to be used to ‘make up’ the appropriate volume to be returned -
                           this could further change the characteristics of the return water and subsequent plume.
                           Some settlement of sediment is expected, though if the water is filtered to remove suspended sediments as far as practicable, it may not be significantly
                           greater than background sedimentation rates. However, the nature of settling sediment from plumes may differ from naturally settling sediment.
Returned seawater plume
                           If the returned seawater is released in the surface waters (Photic Zone) it could: reduce light penetration, reduce plankton growth, inhibit feeding of
                           zooplankton, over stimulate primary production if rich in nutrients (and of different species than those normally occurring in the area), reduce localised
                           dissolved oxygen, increase heavy metal burdens, etc., and increase the footprint of the mining operation even further. They could also reduce water clarity,
                           affecting visual predators. Toxicity and bioaccumulation would also need to be addressed.
                           Plumes could reach kilometres to up to tens of kilometres from the mine site. Plumes will have a gradient of impact, reducing with distance from the discharge
                           location. Discharge and return of seawater to the seafloor (from where it came) should be encouraged, where practicable (it may not be for deeper projects).
                           A higher discharge point may lead to a more extensive plume in the water column.

                            food waste, and highly salinated water from desalination plants. Such vessels will also make atmospheric discharges from engine and incinerator exhausts. The
                            nature of such discharges will, however, vary, depending on the location of the vessels from the shore and existing marine protected areas (as stipulated in

                            The mining vessel could act as a ‘fish aggregating device’. Organisms such as fish, sharks, cephalopods, seabirds, whales, dolphins and turtles may be attracted
                            to the vessel.
                            Associated additional traffic between site and supply areas may increase the chance of shipstrikes on mammals and turtles.

Annex 2. Elements of Stakeholder Engagement (Adapted from IFC
Performance Standard 1)

Stakeholder Analysis and Engagement Planning
Project proponents should identify the range of stakeholders that may be interested in their actions and
consider how external communications might facilitate a dialog with all stakeholders. Where projects
involve specifically identified physical elements, aspects and/or facilities that are likely to generate
adverse environmental and social impacts on Affected Communities the project proponent will identify
the Affected Communities and will meet the relevant requirements described below.
The project proponent will develop and implement a Stakeholder Engagement Plan that is scaled to the
project risks and impacts and development stage, and be tailored to the characteristics and interests of
the Affected Communities. Where applicable, the Stakeholder Engagement Plan will include
differentiated measures to allow the effective participation of those identified as disadvantaged or
vulnerable. When the stakeholder engagement process depends substantially on community
representatives57 the project proponent will make every reasonable effort to verify that such persons do
in fact represent the views of Affected Communities and that they can be relied upon to faithfully
communicate the results of consultations to their constituents.
Disclosure of Information
Disclosure of relevant project information helps Affected Communities and other stakeholders
understand the risks, impacts and opportunities of the project. The project proponent will provide
Affected Communities with access to relevant information58 on: (i) the purpose, nature, and scale of the
project; (ii) the duration of proposed project activities; (iii) any risks to and potential impacts on such
communities and relevant mitigation measures; (iv) the envisaged stakeholder engagement process; and
(v) the grievance mechanism.

Consultation
When Affected Communities are subject to identified risks and adverse impacts from a project, the project
proponent will undertake a process of consultation in a manner that provides the Affected Communities
with opportunities to express their views on project risks, impacts and mitigation measures, and allows
the project proponent to consider and respond to them. The extent and degree of engagement required
by the consultation process should be commensurate with the project’s risks and adverse impacts and


57 For example, community and religious leaders, local government representatives, civil society representatives,
politicians, school teachers, and/or others representing one or more affected stakeholder groups.
58
   Depending on the scale of the project and significance of the risks and impacts, relevant document(s) could
range from full Environmental and Social Assessments and Action Plans to easy-to-understand summaries of key
issues and commitments. These documents could also include the project proponent’s environmental and social
policy and any supplemental measures and actions defined as a result of independent due diligence conducted by
financiers.

                                                                                                               90
with the concerns raised by the Affected Communities. Effective consultation is a two-way process that
should: (i) begin early in the process of identification of environmental and social risks and impacts and
continue on an ongoing basis as risks and impacts arise; (ii) be based on the prior disclosure and
dissemination of relevant, transparent, objective, meaningful and easily accessible information which is
in a culturally appropriate local language(s) and format and is understandable to Affected Communities;
(iii) focus inclusive59 engagement on those directly affected as opposed to those not directly affected; (iv)
be free of external manipulation, interference, coercion, or intimidation; (v) enable meaningful
participation, where applicable; and (vi) be documented. The project proponent will tailor its consultation
process to the language preferences of the Affected Communities, their decision-making process, and the
needs of disadvantaged or vulnerable groups.

Informed Consultation and Participation
For projects with potentially significant adverse impacts on Affected Communities, the project proponent
will conduct an Informed Consultation and Participation (ICP) process that will build upon the steps
outlined above in Consultation and will result in the Affected Communities’ informed participation. ICP
involves a more in-depth exchange of views and information, and an organized and iterative consultation,
leading to the project proponent’s incorporating into their decision-making process the views of the
Affected Communities on matters that affect them directly, such as the proposed mitigation measures,
the sharing of development benefits and opportunities, and implementation issues. The consultation
process should (i) capture both men’s and women’s views, if necessary through separate forums or
engagements, and (ii) reflect men’s and women’s different concerns and priorities about impacts,
mitigation mechanisms, and benefits, where appropriate. The project proponent will document the
process, in particular the measures taken to avoid or minimize risks to and adverse impacts on the
Affected Communities, and will inform those affected about how their concerns have been considered.

Indigenous Peoples
For projects with adverse impacts on Indigenous Peoples, the project sponsor is required to engage them
in a process of ICP and in certain circumstances the project proponent is required to obtain their Free,
Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC). The requirements related to Indigenous Peoples and the definition of
the special circumstances requiring FPIC are described in IFC Performance Standard 7.60

External Communications and Grievance Mechanisms
External Communications. Project proponents will implement and maintain a procedure for external
communications that includes methods to (i) receive and register external communications from the
public; (ii) screen and assess the issues raised and determine how to address them; (iii) provide, track, and
document responses, if any; and (iv) adjust the management program, as appropriate. In addition, project

proponents are encouraged to make publicly available periodic reports on their environmental and social
sustainability.
Grievance Mechanism for Affected Communities. Where there are Affected Communities, the project
proponent will establish a grievance mechanism to receive and facilitate resolution of Affected
Communities’ concerns and grievances about the project proponent’s environmental and social
performance. The grievance mechanism should be scaled to the risks and adverse impacts of the project
and have Affected Communities as its primary user. It should seek to resolve concerns promptly, using
an understandable and transparent consultative process that is culturally appropriate and readily
accessible, and at no cost and without retribution to the party that originated the issue or concern. The
mechanism should not impede access to judicial or administrative remedies. The project proponent will
inform the Affected Communities about the mechanism in the course of the stakeholder engagement
process.

Ongoing Reporting to Affected Communities
The project proponent will provide periodic reports to the Affected Communities that describe progress
with implementation of the project Action Plans on issues that involve ongoing risk to or impacts on
Affected Communities and on issues that the consultation process or grievance mechanism have
identified as a concern to those Communities. If the management program results in material changes in
or additions to the mitigation measures or actions described in the Action Plans on issues of concern to
the Affected Communities, the updated relevant mitigation measures or actions will be communicated to
them. The frequency of these reports will be proportionate to the concerns of Affected Communities but
not less than annually.

              Biological comparisons of the two areas have shown that the samples taken
              from the active sites at both Solwara 1 and South Su share the same
              biomass-dominant species and generally similar indices of diversity and
              community structures. Where there are significant differences, South Su
              generally has higher abundances of secondary species and higher dominance
              of some groups. Some recruitment may also come from North Su (active
              subsea volcano), where extraction is not currently planned. However,
              because of the continuous active conditions and sediment-occluded visibility
              at North Su at the times of survey, it has not been possible to characterise its
              vent communities to the same extent as at Solwara 1 and South Su.

              temporary refuge sites for fauna that may assist with early recolonisation.
              Detailed hydrodynamic modelling was completed in 2014 to identify
              potential refuge locations at different stages of the mine plan.

              Progress against criteria will be examined through monitoring to determine
              if the major community elements (i.e. the three biomass-dominant species)
              have re-established at active chimneys in the earliest mined area.
              Transplant of animals: The loss of animals in the path of the Seafloor
              Production Tools can be minimised. Where feasible, an ROV will be used to
              remove large clumps of rock substrates with biology intact and relocated
              them to appropriate areas within Solwara 1 that have been excavated, or to
              temporary refuge areas. These clumps will be targeted to maximise the
              biomass-dominant species and any other associated attached or sessile
              fauna. Monitoring will be undertaken to confirm the successful of this
              strategy.
              Artificial substrates: Hard substrate animals (e.g. coral) and their associated
              fauna in inactive areas away from the vent ecosystems are expected to
              recover more slowly (compared with animals located in active vent areas).
              The same mitigation strategies employed for vent fauna will also be

and          strategies include:
discharges
                  Compliance with the International Convention for the Prevention of
                 Pollution From Ships (MARPOL) and a commitment to limit surface
                 water discharges to treated sewage (in compliance with MARPOL
                 treatment limits);
                  Limiting launch and recovery of seafloor production tools when there
                 are whales or large cetaceans in the vicinity, including the use of
                 observers to determine the presence of these species during such
                 operations;
                  Directional lighting on the Production Support Vessel, and the
                 restriction of engagement of lighting on seafloor production tools until
                 the tools reach the vicinity of the seafloor, to ensure marine animals
                 such as tuna are not attracted by artificial light in the surface and mid-
                 water column;
                  Speed limits for support barges to minimize the risk of collisions with
                 whales, turtles and other marine mammals;
                  Implementation of a detailed emergency response and spill
                 management plan to minimize the impact of any spills from the
                 Production Support Vessel.
             Published literature on turtle migratory pathways indicates there are no
             major routes between New Ireland and New Britain. Although it is expected
             that most species may migrate between these islands, the operations
             present no threat or obstacle to normal migration that would be materially
             different from normal shipping and commercial fishing activities.

                    (Source: Coffey Natural Systems, 2008 and Nautilus Minerals 63)                               (an incomplete list based on a partial literature review)
              The result of these strategies is that the Solwara 1 Project will cause no harm
              to fisheries, coral reefs, whales, turtles or other pelagic animals.
              Noise
              Noise from ship thrusters will be audible underwater for several hundreds of
              kilometres, as is the case for most large ships and other man-made and
              natural sources. However, noise at levels that may cause harm is limited to
              within tens of metres of the Production Support Vessel. Some behavioural
              avoidance and attraction (by some proportion of whales) is likely to happen
              within 15 kilometres of the vessel, but once established, familiarization with
              this new 'landmark' is likely to occur. The annual humpback whale
              migrations have continued off the east and west coasts of Australia
              notwithstanding the extensive shipping and oil and gas activities.
              Further noise modelling of surface and seafloor noise is planned for 2015, in
              order to determine the impact of natural noisy features (such as the North
              Su volcano), and mitigation strategies required (if any) on the seafloor.

             The EIS stated that “the risks of major losses of equipment or spills of ore or
             fuel oils (during operational and abnormal conditions) will be extremely low
             with the implementation of best practice vessel and equipment maintenance
             procedures, navigational procedures, safety plans, environmental
             management plans, and emergency response plans.”(p.31)

Annex 4. Cook Islands Manganese Nodules
Manganese Nodules are polymetallic concretions formed in deep sea beds usually at a depth of 4 to 5 km.
These nodules contain manganese and smaller amounts of nickel, copper, titanium, cobalt and rare earth
elements. They are potato like shaped and size ranges from 2 to 10 cm in diameters. The nodules are
found lying loosely on the sediment covered abyssal plains of the world’s deep sea basin. Manganese
nodules are formed when dissolved metal compounds in the sea are deposited in solid form around a
core. This process is extremely slow and can take millions of years (SPC, 2013). During the formation of
the nodules several metals are collected from the seafloor but the majority of the metals are found in
very low concentrations for economic recovery (Imperial College London Consultants, 2010).

There are four main locations where manganese nodules can be found at a density that is commercially
attractive: (1) the Clarion Clippertone Zone; (2) the Peru basin; (3) the Penrhyn basin in the Cook Islands;
and (4) the Indian Ocean. The reason for the high nodule density in these areas is similar environmental
conditions. The manganese nodules in Penrhyn basin in the Cook Islands have been know for over a
century. These deposits are known to have a high concentration over a very large area with concentrations
varying but sometimes greater than 25kg/m2 covering approximately 124,000 km2 containing 3.6 billion
tons in wet nodules (Hein at al. 2015, SPC, 2016a). Considering that the commercially interesting density
for such deposits is 5kg/m2 the Cook Islands resources are among the most commercially attractive.

SPC (2016a) provides the annual employment, income and value added (GDP) estimates for a DSM
operation in the Cook Islands. It is estimated that a total of 80 local jobs will be directly supported by DSM
operations. Overall, considering other indirect economic activities, a total of 147 jobs would be supported
by the DSM operations each year. In total, it is also estimated that DSM operations will support $3.4
million in local income and a total of $43.2 million of GDP each year of operation (SPC, 2016a).

Annex 5. The SPC-EU Deep Sea Minerals Project. Objectives and
Outputs 68
 With financial support from the EU, the SPC Geoscience 69 Division implemented the Deep Sea Minerals
 Project from 2011-2016 in 15 Pacific Island Countries70. The project’s specific objective was to
 strengthen the system of governance and capacity of Pacific ACP States in the management of deep-
 sea minerals through the development and implementation of sound and regionally integrated legal
 frameworks, improved human and technical capacity and effective monitoring systems.

 The project’s produced the following outputs under its four Key Result Areas:

 1. Regional legislative and regulatory framework (RLRF) for offshore minerals exploration and mining

     • Held regional deep sea mineral consultation workshops to share deep sea minerals information
     with all stakeholders (representatives of government, civil society, private sector, local communities)
     in the region. Renowned world deep sea mineral experts were in attendance.
     • Fifteen national deep sea minerals stakeholder consultation workshops were held, one for each
     of the 15 Pacific ACP States.
     • Developed, reviewed and finalised the “Pacific ACP States Regional Legislative and Regulatory
     Framework for Deep Sea Minerals Exploration and Exploitation” (RLRF). The RLRF was officially
     launched during the 43rd Forum Leaders Meeting in Rarotonga Cook Islands in August 2012.
     • In consultation with Pacific Island Countries and Territories, develop, review and finalise the
     “Regional Cooperation Agreement for Responsible Deep Seabed Minerals Management”, and to
     table the Agreement to SPC Annual Session and subsequently to Pacific Forum Leaders for
     consideration.

 2. National policy, legislation and regulations

     • Fiji International Seabed Minerals Decree was promulgated in July 2013. The Mineral Bill and
     Seabed Minerals Policy are currently under review.
     • Tonga National Seabed Minerals Act was enacted in August 2014. The Seabed Minerals
     regulations have been drafted and are currently under review.
     •       Tuvalu National Seabed Minerals Act was enacted in December 2014
     • Niue National Seabed Minerals Policy and Legislation and Regulations have been drafted and
     sent to government and are currently under review.
