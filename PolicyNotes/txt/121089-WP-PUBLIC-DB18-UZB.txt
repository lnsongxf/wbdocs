About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

  1   Request and obtain land clearance from Tashkent City Hokimiyat                       38 days                    no charge
      (submission of an application for a land plot and of approved materials)
      Agency : District Governor's O ce

      "Starting on January 1, 2016, the government changed the way land plots of
      up to 1 hectare are allocated to legal entities and individuals. Land plots are
      now assigned on the basis of a competitive selection process. Local
      authorities (municipalities) select land plots that are available for allocation.
      Then, each Municipality has the local Department of Architecture and
      Construction obtain all preliminary approvals of land allocation (previously
      separate procedures) from the relevant authorities, depending on the
      environmental, architectural and zoning requirements of the individual
      plots. Once all approvals are obtained internally by the Department of
      Architecture and Construction, a complete set of documents is prepared for
      each land plot and submitted to the contest organizer within the
      Municipality.


      The time is 38 days (30 days after announcement is made to apply + 3 days
      for the committee to evaluate the bids + 5 days to announce the decision).

      Per the new process, an announcement is made in the mass media that
      there are land plots allocated for a speci c type of construction (e.g.,
      kindergarten, produce store, a warehouse etc.). Subsequently, these land
      plots, with all the necessary characteristics, are made available on the
      website of the State Committee of Uzbekistan on Architecture and
      Construction: http://1kms.uz/kms/announcementnew/list/11.


      There is only one committee that organizes the bid. The announcement
      about the bid is made 1 month before the start of the bidding process, so
      bidders have 1 month to prepare the application and submit the bid. The
      committee takes 3 days to evaluate all the bids and then it has 5 days to
      announce the allotment decision.


      Once the decision is made, it is announced in mass media (in the same
      national and local newspapers where the bid was announced in the rst
      place). The committee will inform the winners within 2 days after the o cial
      announcement. Those who were not selected will nd out in the papers and
      on the website. The announcement is also sent by mail to all bidders.

      The announcement of the auction / competition is made only 2 times a year
      (May and November). This announcement is determined based on demand
      and supply of available land plots.


      The Hokimiyat signs a contract with the winner and the winner can go ahead
      and sign a contract with the project design company.

      The timeframe under the Construction rules, registered by Ministry of Justice
      No.545, for establishing Working Commission is 5 working days. However, in
      practice it takes 14 days, as the Commission only meets once every two
      weeks and in case the le doesn’t make it to the rst meeting, it would
      almost certainly be reviewed at the second one.


      BuildCo must submit the following documents to the Working Commission:
      • The list of organizations that participated in the building and construction
      works, along with the type of work done by these organizations, the family

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

                                                      several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the       - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                   and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                       economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                      - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                      - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees
                                                      equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)            - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                      commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                      - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                               - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                              - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                      movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
