About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of
    the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0
    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                      BuildCo will request a soil test for the structural calculations for the
                      foundation. Contractors ask for a soil test to ensure that the foundation of
                      the building is solid. The engineer must understand the suitability of the soil
                      for the proposed construction work. It allows to build a solid foundation and

      BuildCo will request a soil test for the structural calculations for the
      foundation. Contractors ask for a soil test to ensure that the foundation of
      the building is solid. The engineer must understand the suitability of the soil
      for the proposed construction work. It allows to build a solid foundation and
      avoid structures to be damaged or collapsed or leaned. Although a soil test
      is not required by law, it is consistently conducted in practice.

  2   Submit plans to Municipality and obtain approval                                    45 days            XOF 260,150
      Agency : Municipality

      BuildCo must submit the architectural, structural, and sanitary plans, along
      with a liability statement from the architect who produced the plans and a
      request from the landowner. The City Council meets every week to approve
      the plans. However, due to a backlog it takes on average 45 days for
      approval. For the plans to be approved, BuildCo must continuously follow up
      on the status of the process with the Municipality. The Plan Approval
      Commission meets every Friday. The Commission may revise the plans
      (especially the structural plan), but the plans hardly ever need to be
      resubmitted.


      In the pre-approval stage, it is not required to submit approved technical
      conditions from the water and sewerage, telephone, and electricity services
      to the Municipality.

      After the plans are approved, BuildCo must pay for the issuance of the
      building permit. The approval is done in the previous procedure. Therefore it
      does not take more than a day.

      The company can request a permit for 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year. It is
      cheaper to request a 3-month permit and request renewals. The cost of the
      license depends on the construction duration, area, and perimeter.


      As soon BuildCo obtains the building permit, construction can start without
      any noti cation from the authorities.

  3   Receive inspection from Municipality - I                                            1 day              no charge
      Agency : Municipality

      The Municipality establishes the land boundaries at the beginning of
      construction. It is normal for the municipal inspector to visit the site to check
      whether there is a building permit and whether acceptable construction
      practices are being followed. On average, the company should expect three
      inspections during the whole cycle. No prior request is required.

       Agency : EAGB

       The full process from obtaining approval of the plans (both for water and
       electricity) until the connection is completed takes 2 -- 3 weeks if BuildCo
       follows up consistently. Otherwise it takes 1 -- 1.5 months. The approvals for
       water and electricity connection can be requested simultaneously, but they
       are processed by di erent institutions: the State Secretariat of Energy for
       Electricity and the EAGB for water. The applications for water and electricity
       are both submitted to the EAGB. There are inspections for both water and
       electricity.

  10   Agency : Municipality

       For BuildCo to obtain an occupancy permit, the law requires the Municipality
       to visit the building at the end of construction to check whether it was built
       according to plan. It will then issue an occupancy permit.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       inform about the property transfer for tax purposes. In Bissau, the
       municipality acts as the Cadastre, but outside of the capital there are
       separate Cadastres in which to perform this procedure. Note that land is
       leased and buildings are owned. When the land and building are rst
       registered, the certi cate that is provided is uni ed and contains both sets of
       details on lease and ownership of building. The seven procedures outlined
       describe the process of transferring a uni ed title.

                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants

                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
