         he Internet of things (IoT), or its sibling, Internet of
         everything (IoE), has gone from being a buzzword
         to almost an imperceptible part of our lives. It is
so prevalent that we barely notice it anymore. Our phones

contain a variety of sensors that constantly record and
transmit enormous amounts of information without us
noticing or being aware of it; our houses and cars are              Underdeveloped policy and regulatory
“smarter” than ever before; our public infrastructure (street       frameworks
lights, elevators, escalators, roads) contains myriad sensors
that are essential for their maintenance and our safety;            Unclear business models, despite strong

U.K. (116)

Governments have been slower than the private sector
to respond to the IoT phenomenon. Policy makers must,
however, contend with growing pressure to become
more innovative, open, collaborative, evidence based,
and participatory (3) as the expectations of business and
society change, technology becomes more pervasive, the
old policy regime starts to show cracks, and efficiency and

consumption, transport data, data acquired through sat-

Governance
The e-Estonia digital society evolution started with a
reconsideration of the state, its services, and its legal
framework from scratch. Instead of developing a single,
all-encompassing, central system, Estonia has created an
open, decentralized, and distributed system that links
different services and databases effectively and securely.
The flexibility provided by this open setup has allowed
new components of the digital society to be developed
and added over the years, yet the system remains resilient
to cyber risks.

Estonia has established the role of a government chief
information officer (CIO) (79), who reports (80) to the
minister of economic affairs and communication (and
effectively also the prime minister, through the e-Estonia
Council), to help oversee the coordination of digital proj-
ects including IoT across government while maintaining
the independence and uniqueness of each department’s
digital needs. The CIO is the gatekeeper of finances and
                                                                    Source: Siim Sikkut, Government of Estonia

organizational/strategic level, but success in the field has
been mixed. The adoption of digital solutions including
IoT-based solutions within the private sector continues to
be low. Issues such as lack of knowledge and awareness,
inadequate government support and incentives, and infra-
structure availability despite the presence of new solutions
(for example, LPWANs) are seen as barriers for industry
participation. The value chain of IoT provisioning is also
seen as very complicated, with very few clear business
models around them. The part of the value chain that has
the highest entry barrier is network availability. Estonian
telecom operators currently seem to favor closed value
chains.

objective. The establishment of a separate entity dedi-

administration, and makes it easier for program partici-

Mobile (98), it uses mobile devices such as iPads, QR codes
that track businesses, integrated weight measurement
systems, GPS on vehicles, and a privately owned cloud-

tires, verify and validate locations and tonnage hauled,
and automatically pay the stewards upon successful
completion of activities. The system can track individual
components of a tire, including rubber, steel, and fiber,
based on initial information loaded by the manufacturers.

IoT in Action
India’s Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) selected
Rajkot (108), in the state of Gujarat, as one of the 100
cities participating in its smart cities initiative. Rajkot has
implemented smart initiatives (109) in areas ranging
from transit and e-governance to solid waste manage-
ment and water supply. The city’s vision under its smart
city proposal includes several pan-city and area-based
development initiatives, with a focus on both infrastruc-
ture and ICT advancements in the city and at strategic
locations. Objectives of the proposed ICT initiatives
include public safety improvement and surveillance, traffic
management, quality of public services, and real-time
tracking of services. Several of these initiatives include IoT
components. The city’s municipal corporation is currently
reviewing proposals from the private sector to establish a
200-kilometer-long fiber-optic network, CCTV network,
environmental and other related IoT sensors, and several
Wi-Fi access points. The city envisions providing the infra-
structure to businesses for them to use and benefit from. A
variety of IoT-based projects (110) on water conservation,
solar-based heating, and climate change–related initia-
tives are being planned in partnership with the private
sector.

    is still in its infancy, and while there is tangible excite-

and Estonia’s X-Road standards are examples of policy
interventions aimed at IoT as a technology.
