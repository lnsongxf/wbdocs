Preface
      The Nigeria Biannual Economic Update has three broad aims. First, it reports on
      the key developments in the Nigerian Economy in recent months (Chapter 1).
      The cut-off date for most of the economic variables reported on in this edition
      was June 2017. Secondly, it summarizes the likely economic outcomes in the
      short-to-medium term, given the policy developments, and highlights key short
      term risks and development challenges (Chapter 2). Finally, the Update provides
      a more in-depth examination of selected highly topical economic issues (Chap-
      ter 3). The Nigeria Biannual Economic Update is intended for a wide audience,
      including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the
      community of analysts and professionals engaged in Nigeria’s economy.
      This report is a product of the staff of the International Bank for Reconstruction
      and Development / The World Bank. This edition was prepared by the World
      Bank Macroeconomic and Fiscal Management Global Practice Nigeria Team, led
      by Gloria Joseph-Raji (Senior Economist, GMF01) and Emilija Timmis (Young
      Professional, GMF01). Yue Man Lee (Senior Economist, GMF01) prepared the
      Special Topic (Chapter 3) based on World Bank analysis of state fiscal and debt
      data. Abul Azad (GPV07) provided an update on Socio-Economic and Welfare
      Indicators (Section 1.5) based on the 2015/2016 General Household Survey.
      Valuable contributions were provided by Ulrich Bartsch (Lead Economist,
      GMF01), Masami Kojima (Lead Energy Specialist, GEEX2), and Joseph Oge-
      be (Consultant, GMF01) under the overall supervision by Sona Varma (Act-
      ing Practice Manager, GMF01) and Rachid Benmessaoud (Country Director,
      AFCW2). The report benefited greatly from valuable insights and comments
      from Enrique Armas (Lead Economist, GMF06) and Khwima Nthara (Economic
      Adviser, OPSCE).

       Executive Summary
       Recent Economic Developments
       Nigeria’s economy recorded positive Figure 1.1: GDP Growth (Sector Contribution)
       growth (0.6 percent year-on-year) in the
       second quarter of 2017, after contracting
       for 5 consecutive quarters, and growth is
       expected to reach 1 percent in 2017, contin-
       gent on sustained recovery of oil produc-
       tion. Although the negative spillovers from
       lower oil revenue have diminished with the
       increased availability of foreign exchange,
       macroeconomic imbalances remain and se-
       vere revenue shortfalls continue to hamper
       budget implementation.
       Nigeria experienced its first recession in
       over two decades in 2016, when the econ-
       omy contracted by 1.6 percent due to neg-
       ative oil price and oil production shocks,
       which spilled over to the non-oil sectors. Source: NBS; World Bank Staff projections.
       Oil GDP shrank by 14.4 percent, and non-oil
       GDP contracted by 0.2 percent. Oil exports plummeted by 25 percent in 2016 (in US$ terms);
       however, imports contracted even faster (33 percent) due to constraints on foreign exchange,
       resulting in a positive current account balance (0.7 percent GDP) in 2016.
       In the first half of 2017, oil production recovered somewhat, but was below projections, part-
       ly due to maintenance work. The non-oil GDP recorded positive growth in 2017 (0.7 percent
       yoy in Q1 and 0.4 percent yoy in Q2), driven by continued decent performance in agriculture,
       and non-oil industry due to easing of foreign exchange constraints. However, agricultural
       production was lower than anticipated due to regional floods and instability in Northern Ni-
       geria. The current account is estimated to remain in surplus. Imports show a rising trend in
       the first half of 2017 in line with higher foreign exchange availability.
       Severe revenue shortfalls continue at all tiers of government. While the oil price assumption
       for the budget is below the actual price, oil production underperformed in the first half of
       2017. Administrative measures to boost non-oil revenues have not yet delivered the expected
       impact. This challenges budget implementation, especially for capital expenditures.
       With the revenue shortfall, fiscal pressures also persist at the subnational government level,
       with States requesting an extension of the Budget Support Facility, which was due to ex-
       pire at end-May 2017. While all States have made progress on the reform measures included
       in the 22 point Fiscal Sustainability Plan, implementation is incomplete. Chapter 3 contains
       more detailed analysis of the historical fiscal performance of States and the implications of
       continuing pressures on the states’ fiscal and debt sustainability.
       Broad money growth slowed significantly and reached -1.8 percent in June 2017, from double
       digits in 2016. While the monetary policy rate was maintained at 14 percent throughout the
       year, Naira liquidity was nevertheless tightened considerably through more intensive Open
       Market Operations and foreign exchange sales by the Central Bank despite ongoing Central
       Bank financing of fiscal deficits and its development financing activities. Partly because of
       favorable base effects, headline inflation has been declining since February 2017, reaching
       16.1 percent in June 2017. However, food inflation remains high (19.9 percent) and continues

       to accelerate.
       The Central Bank started providing relief to severely constrained foreign exchange markets
       in February 2017, after external reserves had recovered to about US$29 billion, from a low of
       US$24 billion in October 2016. Despite higher foreign exchange sales, reserves reached US$31
       billion in August 2017. However, import restrictions and multiple exchange rates remain. The
       parallel market premium fell from the peak of over 60 percent in February to 20 percent in
       June, where it stabilized. The official exchange rate has been maintained at around N305/
       US$.



       Economic Outlook
       Economic growth is expected to average about 1 percent in 2017, driven by recovering oil pro-
       duction and the positive impact on private sector activities from the increased supply of for-
       eign exchange. The downward revision from the previous forecast arises largely from lower
       than expected oil production, highlighting downside risks of the economy’s dependence on
       the oil sector. As the government begins to implement the structural reforms outlined in the
       Economic Recovery and Growth Plan 2017-2020 and the associated sector strategies, which
       are still being developed, growth can be expected to strengthen in the medium term, reach-
       ing about 2.8 percent by 2019. Private consumption will likely continue to contract in 2017,
       due to recession repercussions and high inflation, before recovering in the medium term as
       growth picks up and inflation continues to decline.
       Expansionary fiscal policy and arrears clearance1 combined with revenue shortfalls will con-
       tinue to increase the fiscal deficit, and public debt (around 17 percent of GDP at the end of
       June 2017). The Federal Government is expected to continue its efforts to shift deficit financ-
       ing away from the domestic market through subsequent rounds of Eurobond issuance and
       other sources of external financing, toward the target of a 60/40 split between domestic and
       foreign financing. Critical non-oil revenue growth will remain constrained unless there are
       robust reforms in tax policy.
       The prospects of more impactful tax reforms however remain low, as the government treads
       conservatively and the window of opportunity before the 2019 elections is rapidly closing.
       The limited non-oil revenue mobilization effort sustains the chronic fiscal policy vulnerabili-
       ty to oil-revenue fluctuations. Continued financing of government deficit risks crowding-out
       private sector credit and puts pressure on the CBN’s balance sheet. The continuing segmen-
       tation of the foreign exchange market will maintain distortions, inefficiencies, and opportu-
       nities for rent seeking.



       The Case for Sustaining State Fiscal Reform
       As earlier highlighted, Chapter 3 contains an analysis of the historical (2011-2014) fiscal per-
       formance on Nigeria’s State Governments and illustrates how this made them vulnerable to
       the macro-fiscal shocks of 2015-16. The dramatic fall in oil revenue and lack of fiscal consoli-
       dation led to a rapid increase in States’ indebtedness, necessitating two sets of financial assis-
       tance interventions from the Federal Government.
       At present, States remain under considerable fiscal stress, with States requesting continua-
       tion of the Budget Support Facility beyond the original end date of May 2017. With no fur-



        1	   Arrears include delayed payments to contractors and public sector salaries.

       ther fiscal consolidation, States’ fiscal and debt sustainability will continue to deteriorate.
       Under assumptions of a fragile economic recovery (with slightly higher oil price and produc-
       tion), no significant increase in non-oil revenues collected federally or by the States (IGR), no
       further rationalization of State expenditures, as well as no financing constraints, total State
       fiscal deficits could remain around 1 percent of GDP annually through the medium-term.
       This level of fiscal deficits would lead to an increase in total State debt stock to 5.4 percent of
       GDP and 200 percent of revenue by 2020. In this scenario with limited or no fiscal consoli-
       dation, States remain vulnerable and continue to represent a significant source of fiscal risks
       and macroeconomic instability for the country. The need to strengthen fiscal performance
       through sustaining state fiscal reforms that have been accelerated in the past 2 years is there-
       fore of paramount importance.

       Chapter 1: Economic Update

       1.1 Economic Output and Employment

       Economic Output
       1.	     Nigeria’s economy returned to positive growth in the second quarter of 2017 after
       contracting for five consecutive quarters. Nigeria’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew
       by 0.6 percent2 (year-on-year) in the second quarter (Q2) of 2017. The recovery was driven by
       recovering oil production and non-oil industry, and modest growth in agriculture.
       2.	    Oil and gas GDP improved by 1.6 percent in Q2. This was helped by the improved
       security situation in the oil-producing Niger Delta, and the completion of repair and main-
       tenance works on some of the oil installations. The country’s oil output improved to an esti-
       mated average of 1.9 million barrels per day (mb/d) in Q2 from an average of 1.8 mb/d in the
       corresponding period of 2016 (Figure 1.2). The average oil price during the quarter (US$ 50.9)
       was also higher than the price in Q2 2016 (US$ 46.6).




       Source: NBS; S&P Global Platts.                                  Source: NBS


       3.	    On the back of the recovery of oil GDP and increased supply of foreign exchange,
       non-oil industry started recovering in 2017, growing by 1.1 and 1.3 percent (yoy) in the first
       and second quarters, respectively. Growth of the manufacturing sub-sector, which had re-
       turned to positive territory in Q1 (1.4 percent) slowed in Q2 to 0.6 percent, while construction
       remained at 0.1 percent.
       4.	     Agricultural sector growth slowed in the second quarter of 2017. While the agricul-
       tural sector has maintained positive growth even through the recession, its growth has con-
       tinuously slowed in the past three quarters, growing by 3.0 percent in Q2 2017, as compared
       with 3.4 percent in Q1 2017 (Figure 1.3). This has been likely due to the on-going crisis in the
       north-east region, recurrent farmer-herdsmen clashes in the north-central region and re-
       gional floods that have displaced farming communities and affected agricultural production.
       5.	    The services sector continued to contract in the second quarter of 2017. The sector
       contracted by 0.8 percent (year-on-year) in Q2, slightly worse than the contraction of 0.4

        2	 This refers to the real GDP at market prices. The Nigerian Government references GDP growth at basic prices (i.e. before
        adding net indirect taxes), but standard international practice is to reference GDP growth at market prices. Real GDP growth at
        basic prices was 0.55 percent in Q2 2017.

       percent in Q1 (Figure 1.3). Sub-sectors like Wholesale & Retail Trade and Finance & Insurance
       performed better in Q2, relative to their performance in Q1. Finance & Insurance grew par-
       ticularly strongly in Q2, at 10.5 percent (Table 1.1).
       6.	    Non-oil industry growth was buoyed by improved availability of foreign exchange
       and fuel. Foreign exchange from both the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and autonomous
       sources was tight throughout 2016. From February 20, 2017, the CBN began to generously
       supply foreign exchange to the markets and in April, the flexible-rate Investors and Export-
       ers Foreign Exchange (IEFX) window was established and contributed to an increase in au-
       tonomous foreign exchange inflows. This unlocked a major bottleneck to investment and
       output growth.
       7.	     Relief in the fuel supplies may be short lived. With prices fixed since May 2016,
       the petrol price is now no longer aligned with market fundamentals. The price modulation
       mechanism envisaged by the Federal Government in May 2016 has not been implemented.
       The state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has almost fully taken
       over importation of the petroleum products, incurring losses and paving the way for a return
       of the implicit fuel subsidy.

       Employment
       8.	     Latest official employment and job creation data for Nigeria show increasing unem-
       ployment and underemployment throughout 2016. Unemployment and underemployment
       reached 14.2 and 21 percent, respectively in Q4 of 2016 (Figure 1.4). However, the Purchasing
       Managers’ Index (PMI) 3 (Figure 1.5), which is computed monthly by the CBN and measures
       employment levels as one of its constituent variables, has shown an improving trend after
       crossing the 50-point mark in April. The positive movement indicates some level of expan-
       sion in the economy, corroborated in part by the Q2 GDP outturns.




        3	 The PMI is based on data compiled from surveys of purchasing and supply executives of manufacturing and non-manufactur-
        ing businesses. Survey responses indicate whether there is change or no change in the level of business activities in the current
        month compared with the previous month. The specific indicators measured include: production level, supplier delivery time
        (for manufacturing firms), business activity (for non-manufacturing firms), new orders, employment level and raw materials
        inventory. A composite PMI above 50 points indicates that the manufacturing/non-manufacturing economy is generally expanding, 50
        points indicates no change and below 50 points indicates that it is generally declining.

       1.2 The External Sector: Balance of Payments and Exchange Rate Devel-
       opments

       Balance of Payments
       9.	     The current account balance was positive in the first half of 2017. It however de-
       clined from US$2.7 bn in Q1 to US$1.4 bn in Q2 as imports grew faster than exports (Figure
       1.6). The value of goods and services exports increased in this period in line with oil sector
       developments. Goods and services exports increased by 20 percent relative to the first half
       of 2016, and by 16 percent, relative to the second half of 2016. These movements were large-
       ly driven by crude oil prices and a recovery in production. Oil prices reached an average
       of US$52.8 per barrel in H1 2017, relative to the average of US$40.9 per barrel in H1 2016
       and US$49.5 per barrel in H2 2016. Non-oil goods exports growth recovered to 28 percent
       compared to 2016 H1 and 69 percent compared to the second half of 2016. In 2017 H1, goods
       and services imports were lower than in the same period of 2016. However, compared to the
       preceding quarter, imports stagnated in Q1 2017, reflecting continuous shortages of foreign
       exchange, before starting to grow again in Q2 2017 as the CBN enhanced the supply of forex.

       10.	     The Financial Account was also positive in the first half of 2017, buoyed by increas-
       ing portfolio and other investment inflows. It returned to positive territory (USD 4.3 and
       4.6 billion, respectively, in Q1 and Q2 2017), from a negative position in the fourth quarter
       of 2016 due to the substantial improvements in Net Portfolio and Other Investment. Net Di-
       rect Investment also remained positive (Table 1.3). The improvements in portfolio and other
       investment inflows were largely driven by renewed investor confidence in the economy, fol-
       lowing the establishment of the Investors and Exporters FX window in April.

       Foreign Exchange Policy and Exchange Rate Developments
       11.	    The building of foreign reserves continued in the first half of 2017. External reserves
       grew particularly strongly (by US$ 3 billion) in Q1 2017, driven by strengthening oil exports
       and issuance of Eurobonds. Foreign reserves continued to accrue after the CBN resumed
       generous forex supply in Q2. In light of rising reserves, the CBN moved to sell more foreign
       exchange to the economy in early 2017 to reduce the parallel market premium. The CBN sup-
       plied a total of US$ 610 million to the interbank market and BDCs in Q1 2017, up from US$140
       million in Q4 2016; and it is estimated that it has supplied a total of over US$ 9 billion to the
       interbank market between February and August 2017.
       12.	     Higher availability of foreign exchange led to an appreciation of the parallel mar-
       ket rate. The parallel market rate recovered from a low of N520/US$ in February to around
       N365/US$ currently. The premium between the official CBN rate and the average monthly
       parallel market rate fell from 60 percent to 20 percent. The official rate has remained in the
       range of N305-N307 to the US$. The CBN also abolished the requirement that banks allocate
       at least 60 percent of their foreign exchange sales to the manufacturing sector. However, the
       list of 41 items not eligible for official foreign exchange allocation, which was instituted in
       June 2015, was retained.
       13.	    Furthermore, the foreign exchange markets remain segmented, creating market in-
       efficiencies. The CBN instituted several special windows for the sale of foreign exchange to
       improve foreign exchange availability. Consequently, the following foreign exchange win-
       dows exist in the Nigeria foreign exchange market:
             •	 The CBN official window for goods (“visibles”) transactions where the CBN intervenes
                at a rate ranging from N305 – N307 per US$. This is in practice, however applicable
                mainly for the importation of petroleum products (which effectively keeps domestic
                petrol prices subsidized at current levels) and other Government transactions;
             •	 The interbank Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS) FX window where the
                CBN intervenes through the sale of FX to authorized dealers (wholesale) or end-users
                (retail) in spot and 7-60 day forward sales, with the NiFEX5 rate being the reference
                rate (currently about N329/US$). At this window, the CBN has sometimes direct-
                ed sales to specific sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and petroleum
                downstream;
             •	 A special interbank FX window established on February 20, 2017 for retail “invisi-
                bles” transactions (school fees, medical fees, Business and Personal Travel Allowance).
                The CBN indicated that it expects US$ to be sold at a rate of no more than 20 percent
                above the interbank market rate (currently, US$ is sold at N360 at this window);
             •	 A special SME window established on April 10, 2017, to improve access of SMEs to FX
                (a maximum of US$20,000 per customer per quarter with highly simplified documen-
                tation requirements). US$ is currently sold at N360 at this window;
             •	 An Investors & Exporters FX window (IEFX), established on April 21 mainly for port-
                folio investors and exporters, based on market-determined rates (with the NAFEX6
                being the reference rate for transactions in this window). CBN’s main objective for
                establishing this window was to address the needs for capital repatriation, dividend
                remittances, loan repayments, loan interest repayments, and software subscription
                payments, amongst others. The total turn-over at this window as at end-June was
                about $3.7 billion and this rose to over US$13 billion by end-September. The rate at
                this window is currently about US$360/US$, very close to the BDC/parallel market
                rate of N365/US$.
       •	        The Bureau de Change (BDC) window, which currently trades at N365/US$.

       1.3 The Monetary Sector: Monetary and Credit Aggregates, Financial
       Market Indicators and Inflation

       Monetary and Credit Aggregates, Financial Market Indicators
       14.	     Monetary policy tightened in the first half of 2017. While the Monetary Policy Rate
       (MPR) has remained flat at 14 percent since July 2016 and the Cash Reserve Requirement
       (CRR) at 22.5 percent since March 2016, monetary tightening has occurred through issuance
       of significant amounts of CBN securities (including the use of special Open Market Opera-
       tions (OMO) to mop up large amounts of liquidity from the banking system), and the use of
       the CRR in a way that makes it effectively higher than the stipulated rate. Consequently,
       broad money (M2) contracted by 1.8 percent year-on-year (yoy) in June 2017. Year-to-date
       (ytd), the contraction was 7.3 percent. Credit to the private sector grew by only 2.6 percent
       yoy and stagnated, ytd. The Federal Government continued to borrow from both the Central
       Bank and the commercial banks.
       15.	   Monetary tightening led to high and volatile money market rates during the pe-
       riod. The average interbank call rate was 65 percent in April while the average overnight
       rate was 50 percent (reaching as high as 200 percent on April 12). It also contributed to the
       slowing of inflation during the period. Headline inflation decelerated continuously for five
       months since February; from a peak of 18.7 percent in January to 16 percent in June 2017 (see
       below for broader discussion on inflation).
       16.	   The Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) has appreciated continu-
       ously since February 2017. The ASI climbed to over 30,000 in June, for the first time since
       September 2015, after oscillating between 23, 916 and 29, 598 in 2016. Activity benefited from
       the Investors’ and Exporters’ FX window (IEFX), introduced by the CBN in April 2017, which
       boosted confidence. Listed companies showed improved results in Q1 2017.

       17.	    Rating agencies maintained their ratings on Nigeria’s long-term foreign and local
       currency sovereign debt. Fitch retained the B+ rating for both foreign and local currency
       debt. Standard & Poor’s also maintained its rating of Nigeria’s long-term global scale ratings at
       “B” with a ‘stable’ outlook. Similarly, Moody’s has not revised its B1 long-term issuer rating of
       the Government of Nigeria since Q2 2016.

       Inflation
       18.	    Nigeria’s headline inflation slowed since February 2017. Inflation peaked at 18.7 per-
       cent in January 2017, but slowed to 16.1 percent in June 2017. Core7 inflation declined from
       a high of 18.2 percent in November 2016 to 12.5 percent in June 2017 but food inflation in-
       creased from 17.8 percent in January to 19.9 percent in June. The decline in core inflation has
       been largely due to favorable base effects over H1 2016, when electricity tariffs and petrol
       prices increased substantially, while the Naira depreciated in the parallel market. Food infla-
       tion increased partly because of the displacement of farming communities in the North-East.

       1.4 The Fiscal Accounts

       Federally-Collected Revenue
       19.	    Severe revenue shortfalls continue to hamper fiscal policy implementation. Prelim-
       inary data as at June 2017 indicate that net federally-collected revenues8 reached only 50
       percent of budget targets in the first six months of 2017 9 (compared with an average of 85
       percent in the first six months of 2012-2014 and 68 percent in the first six months of 2015). Oil
       revenues were only 39 percent of the pro-rated budget for the six-month period, while non-
       oil revenues were 52 percent of budgeted amounts. While the oil price assumption used in
       the 2017 budget is below the actual price, oil production was lower than expected in the first
       half of 2017, although higher than in 2016. Oil production averaged 1.9 mb/d, compared with
       the budgeted 2.2 mb/d. Corporate taxes and Value-Added Tax (VAT) were also grossly un-
       der-collected relative to budget: by 61 percent and 48 percent, respectively. Administrative
       measures to increase non-oil revenues did not show much impact in 2017 H1. It is expected
       that corporate taxes pick up in the second half of the year, as most companies finalize their
       annual reporting at end-June of each year and remit related taxes from July.




        8	 This refers to revenues that were realized and distributed in the months of January to June, which represent revenues
        collected for the months of December to May.
        9	 Gross revenues net of items such as revenue collection agency fees, Joint Venture (JV) cash calls, revenues in excess of
        specific benchmarks (notably the excess crude oil revenue) but including the exchange rate difference, and any subsidies are
        deducted to arrive at the net measure, which is then distributed according to the existing revenue -sharing formulae. The re-
        ported revenues include the 13% derivation revenues shared only to the oil-producing states.

       Federal Government Budget
       20.	     The Federal Government’s 2017 budget was approved only in June 2017. The ap-
       proved budget authorizes a total expenditure of N7.4 trillion (USD24.4 billion, or 6.9 percent
       of GDP).10 The allocation to capital expenditure is N2.2 trillion, which represents 29 percent
       of the total budgeted expenditure,11 while the sum of N4.8 trillion, representing 65 percent
       of the budget, was allocated to recurrent expenditure. Statutory Transfers, with N434 billion
       allocated, represent 6 percent of the budget. Of the recurrent expenditure, the sum of N1.7
       trillion, representing 22 percent of expenditure was allocated to external and domestic debt
       service.12 The Federal Government expects to raise a total of N5.1 trillion in revenues and
       thus have a budget deficit of N2.4 trillion (an estimated 2.2 percent of GDP), which it expects
       to finance through domestic and foreign borrowing.
       21.	    The budget passed by the National Assembly (NASS) was N143 billion (2 percent
       higher than the revised budget proposed by the Executive). The NASS increased the oil price
       benchmark from N42.50 to N44.50, which led to additional budgeted revenues for all tiers
       of Government. The additional revenues accruing to the federal government were mainly
       allocated to various capital projects. The acting President signed the budget with an under-
       standing that there would be a budget amendment later on to address concerns raised by the
       Executive about some of the budget amendments made by NASS. Much like the 2016 budget,
       the 2017 capital budget is to be implemented from June 2017 through June 2018, unless the
       2018 budget comes into effect before then.




        10	 If principal repayments are excluded from debt service expenditure, but rather considered as amortization of existing debt
        (in budget financing “below the line”), total budgetary expenditure will be N7.3 billion.
        11	 This is exclusive of the estimated capital component of the Statutory Transfers, which, if considered, would increase the
        capital expenditure component of the budget to 32 percent.
        12	 The Federal Government’s Debt Service aggregate comprises of both principal and interest payments.

       22.	     The Federal Government collected only about half of its budgeted revenues in the
       first half of the year. The federal government’s share of oil and non-oil revenues were respec-
       tively, only 39 percent and 51 percent of budget target. Corporate taxes were only 39 percent
       realized and VAT only 52 percent realized. Independent revenues were only 30 percent re-
       alized. Other revenues (comprising solid mineral revenues, NLNG dividends, exchange rate
       difference, and excess PPT revenue) however, came in far above the budget estimates. Of
       the total N1.25 trillion domestic borrowing anticipated in the budget for 2017, the sum of
       N845 billion was raised through FGN bonds, Nigerian treasury bills and the new FGN sav-
       ings bonds13 in the first half of the year. The budget also anticipated US$3.5 billion in external
       borrowing. While a total of US$1.5 billion in Eurobonds was raised by the FGN in February
       and March, this was applied towards implementation of the extended 2016 budget. The inau-
       gural US$300 million diaspora bonds issued in June for the financing of the 2017 budget were
       oversubscribed by 30 percent.

       23.	    Capital budget implementation was delayed by the late budget approval. While the
       recurrent budget (pro-rated for six months) was 95 percent implemented, there had been no
       quarterly capital release under the 2017 budget as at the end of June.14 All the capital projects
       executed up to this time were executed as part of the 2016 budget which was implemented
       up till May 5, 2017. As in 2016, the capital budget will likely be implemented well after the
       end of the calendar year.



       State Government Fiscal Developments
       24.	     Statutory transfers to state governments were severely affected by revenue short-
       falls. Transfers from the federation account were 57 percent short of projected, while trans-
       fers from the VAT pool account were 48 percent short. These transfers still constituted 66
       percent of total state government revenues in 2016.


       25.	     In a bid to further support states to weather the fiscal headwinds, the Vice Presi-
       dent, on June 29, 2017, approved an extension of the second financial assistance package:
       the ‘Budget Support Facility (BSF)’. The BSF, anchored on the 22-point Fiscal Sustainability
       Plan (FSP), was extended to the states from June 2016, for 12 months, and was thus meant to
       have fully disbursed at end-May 2017. The original facility was to be around a total of N500
       billion financed by “special purpose” bonds sold to the private sector and guaranteed by the
       federal government in the bond market, to be disbursed in 12-monthly tranches to provide
       added relief from the fiscal crunch. The implementation of the FSP is in progress but remains
       incomplete and has not been fully enforced as conditions for receiving the monthly BSF dis-
       bursements. The BSF was authorized for extension until all state government claims on the
       federal government have been fully settled. Such claims would include the balance of the
       Paris Club over-deduction refunds due to states15, amongst any others. A first tranche of the

       1.5 Socio-Economic and Welfare Indicators
       26.	   This section provides an update on some of Nigeria’s socio-economic and welfare
       indicators based on the 2015/2016 General Household survey (GHS). The GHS is a panel sur-
       vey of 5,000 households representative at the national and geopolitical zone/regional level.
       The survey is a collaborative effort of the Living Standards Measurement Study and Poverty
       teams of the World Bank and the National Bureau of Statistics of the Federal Government
       of Nigeria. The teams, both Government and the World Bank, have been working together
       since 2010 on the GHS and have implemented a total of three waves of GHS panel; 2010/2011,
       2012/2013 and 2015/2016. Data from the panel surveys allows a comprehensive analysis of
       welfare indicators and socio-economic characteristics, and also helps measure poverty and
       growth at the regional and national level. The following are key highlights of the 2015/2016
       GHS Panel:
       27.	    Demographic Characteristics: The average household size in Nigeria is 5.5 persons.
       Rural and urban averages are 5.9 and 4.9 persons respectively, which hasn’t changed signifi-
       cantly since the 2012/2013 GHS. The data also reveal that households in the South tend to be
       smaller than those in the North: household size in the South ranges from 4.0 to 4.9 persons,
       while in the North the range is 5.7 to 7.9. The average number of household members have
       increased in the northeast by 0.6 and in the northwest by 0.5 persons.

       28.	    The dependency ratio both in rural (1.1%) and urban (0.9%) areas remained unchanged
       since the last GHS. Regionally, the highest dependency ratios occur in the North West (1.4)
       followed by Northeast (1.1).
       29.	    The 15 to 64 years age group (working age population) accounts for the largest share of
       the national population: 53.3 percent. This group is relatively evenly distributed across men
       (25.6%) and women (27.7%). The second largest group is the 10 to 14 years age group (41.3 per-
       cent), while the 65 and above age group constitutes 5.4 percent. . Nationally, 21 percent of the
       households are female headed, with the highest regional occurrence found in the Southeast
       (38%).

       30.	    Education: Between the ages of 5 and 9, 42.7 percent and 46.4 percent of males and
       females, respectively, reported to be able to read and write. 91 percent of the males within the
       age group 20-30 reported to be able to read and write compared to 74.5 percent of females.
       Literacy rate among the age bracket 30+ is found to be 77.2 percent for males and 56.6 percent

       the largest gender disparity for enrollment in government schools occurs in the Northcentral
       with 69.1 percent for males and 63.1 percent for females. While enrollment in private schools

       Chapter 2: Economic Outlook

       2.1 Economic Outlook

       Growth
       39.	    Economic growth is expected to remain positive in the second half of 2017, averag-
       ing about 1 percent for 2017. Growth is expected to be driven by a recovery of oil production,
       sustained growth in agriculture, and the positive impact on investment and other private
       sector activities from improved availability of foreign exchange to support imports. A small
       downward revision from our earlier forecast arises from lower than expected oil production,
       highlighting the downside risks of the economy’s dependence on oil. As the government be-
       gins to implement the structural reforms outlined in the Economic Recovery and Growth
       Plan 2017-2020, growth can be expected to strengthen further in the medium term, reaching
       about 2.8 percent by 2019.
       40.	    The Federal Government’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan envisages higher
       oil and non-oil growth. World Bank staff expect economic growth reaching 2.8 percent in
       2019, compared to 4.5 percent expected by the Government (Tables 2.1-2.2). The World Bank
       baseline projections take into consideration several risks, including to the level of oil produc-
       tion and the availability of foreign exchange, and sluggishness in agriculture because of the
       ongoing crises in the North East and the regional floods affecting agricultural production.
       Finally, the World Bank projects a much slower recovery of the services sector.
       41.	    Inflation is projected to remain high, declining slowly in the short-to-medium term.
       Inflationary inertia is expected to continue to put pressure on prices, because of as-yet in-
       complete pass through of higher fuel and electricity prices, and monetization of fiscal deficits.
       Imported goods’ prices remain sticky even after the appreciation of the Naira in the paral-
       lel foreign exchange market. Food inflation is expected to remain high, due to both slower
       growth in agricultural production, the restrictions on several key imported food items, and
       disruptions in several regions.
       42.	     Private consumption is expected to continue to contract slightly in 2017.16 Consump-
       tion is negatively affected by high unemployment following the recession and high (especial-
       ly food) inflation. Consumption should recover slowly in the medium term as growth picks
       up and inflation continues to decline. Projections indicate that the poverty rate will continue
       to rise during 2018 and 2019 but at a slower pace than in the past.

       Balance of Payments
       43.	    The current account is expected to remain in surplus in the short-to-medium term.
       Exports are expected to grow in line with the recovering oil and gas production and the pro-
       jected increase in oil prices in 2017 and 2018. In 2017, non-oil exports are expected to main-
       tain the strong growth rates exhibited in the first half of 2017, and then grow in line with
       agricultural production in the medium term. Imports are expected to continue to grow, in
       line with the recovering industrial production and gross capital formation, as well as higher
       prices for imported petroleum products. The positive trend in oil exports and imports is ex-
       pected to be reversed once the new private sector oil refinery becomes operational (expected
       in 2019-2020). However, the net overall effect on the trade balance will depend on the config-
       uration of the refinery17.



       Government Fiscal Operations
       44.	    The implementation of the 2017 Federal Government budget and the Medium-Term
       Expenditure Framework will be challenging given the expected severe revenue shortfalls.
       In particular, based on the data of the first 6 months of revenue collections, non-oil revenues
       are expected to fall short of their ambitious revenue targets: the VAT and Corporate revenues
       by about half, Special levies by about a third, with only Custom revenues coming in at just
       slightly under the budget targets. Combined with the expected arrears clearances, this will
       increase the fiscal deficit, and public debt, which stood at around 17 percent of GDP at the
       end of June 2017. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen further in 2018, with settlement of
       arrears and power sector reform.



        17	 Refinery economics are complex and subject to large swings (booms and busts). There are years when refineries make large
        losses globally. During such periods, it may be more economic to import refined products than to refine domestic crude. What
        is important for economic efficiency is that all refineries pay market prices for crude oil, and sell their products at trade parity
        (export or import parity, depending on the trade status of each product). Assuming the domestic refineries are efficient and
        competitive, domestic refining can save the costs of ocean shipping of refined products.

The Case for Sustaining State Fiscal Reform                                Nigeria Biannual Economic Update


       45.	    The Federal Government is expected to continue its efforts to shift the deficit fi-
       nancing away from the domestic markets. In addition to US$ 1.5 billion of Eurobonds issued
       in the first quarter of 2017 and the $300 million diaspora bond issued in the second quarter,
       the government is expected to move toward the target of a 60/40 split between domestic
       and foreign financing. State governments’ spending is also likely to continue to be subdued
       in 2017 if FAAC transfers remain relatively low. While States’ total inflows are expected
       to increase relative to 2016, including through receipts from FAAC for Paris Club over-de-
       ductions, the overall increase is likely to be limited with the projected federally collected
       revenue shortfalls. As States will continue to be constrained in borrowing from commercial
       banks and domestic capital markets, we can expect total expenditures to also be constrained
       – unless the accumulate further domestic arrears..
       46.	   In the medium term, the critical non-oil revenue growth will remain constrained
       by lack of reforms in tax policy and administration. Tax administration reforms and a tax
       amnesty launched in July 2017 are expected to have only a moderately positive impact in the
       short and medium term (please see Section 2.2 for more detail).



       2.2 Risks to the Recovery
       47.	    The prospect of sustained positive economic growth remains contingent on a sus-
       tained recovery of oil production, and the absence of shocks to agriculture. Although the
       Niger Delta security situation has improved, oil production remains vulnerable to disrup-
       tions. In the first half of 2017, oil production was on average 0.4 mb/d below the Govern-
       ment’s projection.
       48.	    Given the unorthodox exchange rate policies, the exchange rate stability and the
       parallel market premium depend on recovering oil exports and external financial inflows.
       External shocks to foreign exchange earnings may lead to a recurrence of disruptive foreign
       exchange shortages. The segmentation of the foreign exchange market will continue to cre-
       ate distortions, inefficiencies, and opportunities for rent seeking. Further policy adjustments
       towards a more transparent and liberal exchange rate regime, including the removal of the
       foreign exchange restrictions and reduction of foreign exchange market segmentation, would
       reduce the forex dependence on favorable external conditions, and limit the negative spill-
       overs to the economy.
       49.	    The prospects of impactful tax policy reforms remain low in light of the 2019 elec-
       tions. The limited non-oil revenue mobilization efforts sustain the chronic fiscal policy vul-
       nerability to oil revenue fluctuations. The continued financing of government deficit by the
       CBN and commercial banks crowd out private sector credit and puts pressure on the CBN’s
       balance sheet. The lack of conditionality in bail-out disbursements to state-governments
       may reduce the incentives for meaningful fiscal reforms at the state level of government,
       potentially further increasing fiscal risks.



       2.3 ERGP Implementation update: Developments in Priority Areas
       50.	    The Federal Government’s Economic Growth and Recovery Plan (ERGP) 2017-2020
       identifies structural weaknesses in the economy. It lays out a comprehensive strategy for
       achieving short-term economic recovery. It also shows the Government’s vision of structural
       reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and setting it on a path toward sustained and
       inclusive economic growth in the medium-to-long-term.

The Case for Sustaining State Fiscal Reform                                  Nigeria Biannual Economic Update


       51.	   There was some progress in key structural reform areas identified in the ERGP over
       the past year. Some highlights include:
       •	      Fiscal policy and Governance: Treasury Single Account (TSA) provides increased
       transparency on Federal Government’s revenues and cash flows; public monthly financial
       and operational reports increased NNPC transparency of the NNPC; Federal and States’ gov-
       ernments’ agreements on Fiscal Sustainability Plan and Open Government Partnership prin-
       ciples stand to improve sub-national coordination (see Chapter 3 for details).
       •	      Access to finance: in addition to CBN’s several directed financing schemes (such as the
       Anchor Borrowers Program for farmers and MSME fund), the Secured Transactions in Move-
       able Assets Bill (gazetted in May) provides the legal framework for the movable collateral
       registry at the CBN and should facilitate access to finance for SMEs. The Federal Competition
       and Consumer Protection Bill (also passed in May) is expected to contribute to enabling busi-
       ness environment.
       •	      Oil and Gas Sector benefitted from improvements in the Niger Delta security situa-
       tion, progress in settlement of Joint-Venture Cash Call arrears and in passage of the Petro-
       leum Industry Governance Bill by the Senate.
       •	     Job Creation, with special focus on Youth, can be expected to benefit from private
       sector credits and grants (such as GEEP), targeted skill building programs (such as YESSO,
       N-Power, and Life Skills training).
       52.	    However, the window for further concrete policy action is gradually closing as the
       country approaches a new election season. A number of the associated sector strategies re-
       main to be developed, and meaningful buy-in from subnational governments is not very ev-
       ident. Below is the review of two parts of the plan that can be seen as the backbone of ERGP:
       power sector reform, where the progress is visible; and domestic revenue mobilisation, where
       more decisive actions are needed.  



       Power Sector Recovery
       53.	     The power sector is in crisis, both in terms of service delivery and as well as its fi-
       nancial situation. The accumulated financial deficit of the sector reached US$2.6 billion at
       end-2016. The poor financial situation of the eleven distribution companies (DISCOs) coupled
       with their highly-leveraged balance sheets, severely constrain their ability to access com-
       mercial financing. This in turn hampers their ability to invest to reduce losses and improve
       reliability. Since generation companies (GENCOs) are not being paid in full, they are not able
       to meet their operational costs and payment to gas suppliers. Poor governance and associated
       poor transparency and accountability, together with lack of financial viability, lead to lack of
       enforcement of laws, regulations and contracts.
       54.	    The Power Sector Recovery Program (PSRP) approved in March 2017 aims to restore
       financial viability while improving transparency and service delivery. It seeks to de-risk
       the power sector to mobilize private sector investment along the entire value chain. It is a
       comprehensive package of policy, legal, regulatory, operational, and financial interventions.
       The PSRP envisages measures to contain costs and manage contingent liabilities so as to en-
       sure affordability of tariffs. Tariffs are expected to be raised in a phased manner to reach full
       cost recovery by 2021. During the transition period, the gap between tariff revenues and
       actual costs (i.e. the “tariff shortfall”) is to be fully funded by the Government to ensure no
       further deficit is accumulated and existing arrears are settled.

       55.	    The key challenge of the PSRP will be in implementation. Building on the lessons of
       past reform efforts, the PSRP has several distinguishing features:
       	improving governance and institutional effectiveness to ensure that mechanisms to im-
         prove performance and efficiency in the power sector are fully enforced;
       	strong commitment of reformists in the Government to chart a comprehensive action plan
         for recovery of the sector;
       	it embraces Government’s role in a privatized power market including the role of public
         funding in meeting the required revenues of privatized companies until tariffs reach cost
         recovery levels;
       	strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement and communication to generate consensus
         building and acceptance of reforms;
       	a concerted effort to promote rural electrification through a complimentary program of
         off-grid solutions.
       56.	    There is some progress in the implementation of the PSRP. This includes appoint-
       ment of competent commissioners for the regulatory agency NERC, and funding allocation
       in the 2017 budget for the electricity purchased by Ministries, Departments and Agencies. A
       Delivery Unit has been set up to monitor the PSRP.



       Domestic Revenue Mobilization
       57.	   Increasing the insufficient level of public investment and social spending in Nige-
       ria requires substantially higher revenue collection. Weak global oil prices and stagnating
       domestic oil production mean Nigeria can no longer rely on oil revenues. However, Nigeria’s
       non-oil revenue collection is extremely low. In 2016, corporate taxes reached only 1 percent
       of GDP, excises a negligible 0.04 percent, and VAT only 0.8 percent of GDP, compared to 5
       percent on average in Africa and 6-8 percent globally.
       58.	  Weak non-oil revenue collection is a result of sub-optimal tax policy and weak tax
       administration. The VAT system illustrates this clearly:
       •	 Nigeria’s VAT rate of 5 percent is the lowest in the Africa region (average 16 percent);
       •	 Nigeria’s VAT collection efficiency (i.e. actual vs. potential) is at 18 percent, compared to 33
          percent on average in Africa, due to exemptions (only 40 percent of consumption is sub-
          ject to VAT) and weak VAT administration with compliance below 50 percent.
       59.	   So far, the Government is relying on strengthening tax administration to increase
       non-oil revenues. Most notably, FIRS tax and Customs administration reforms aimed at tax-
       payer registration bringing in 800,000+ new taxpayers, Intensified CIT audits, Stamp duty
       machines rolled out in every state, VAT automation, and Enforcement of VAT remittances
       from States. This is necessary but not sufficient, as can be seen in the first half of 2017, when
       non-oil revenue collection only reached 50 percent of budget target.18 The voluntary asset
       and income declaration scheme that has just been put in place may boost revenues but only
       temporarily.

        18	 The discussion refers to revenues in nominal terms. While the economic recession could have negatively affected the
        revenue collection in real terms, with high inflation and positive nominal GDP growth the nominal revenues would still be
        expected to increase.

       60.	    Strong tax policy reforms are urgently needed in addition to administration efforts.
       Increasing the VAT rate – this would have the biggest revenue impact - may not be feasible
       in the short term as it requires legislative action. However, impactful measures can still be
       implemented through executive actions in the near-term:
       •	 Reduce VAT exemptions so that only goods that are consumed mostly by the poor such as
          publicly provided health and education and unprocessed staple foods are exempt. Limit
          zero rating to exports only. These measures could raise additional 1 percent of GDP with-
          out increasing the rate;
       •	 Increase excise rates on alcohol and tobacco – could raise additional 0.2 to 1 percent of GDP
          (depending on how the size of the increase);
       •	 Rationalize tax incentives that erode the corporate tax base without clear economic ben-
          efits – for example do not grant new tax holidays – and eliminate discretionary power to
          grant tax incentives;
       •	 At the subnational level, additional revenue gains could be made from state/local govern-
          ment reforms such as a review of property taxes.
       61.	    The Federal Government should also support States to strengthen their IGR efforts
       to boost their ability to do development spending at the state level. Subnational govern-
       ments historically were responsible for about half of the total public spending, and crucially,
       the majority of service delivery. States and Local governments’ active role and contributions
       to structural reforms spelled out in the ERGP are essential in diversifying the Nigerian econ-
       omy away from its chronic dependency on oil sector and placing the country on a more sus-
       tainable growth path.

       Chapter 3: States’ Fiscal Performance
       3.1 The Role of States19 in Fiscal Management

       62.	     Nigeria’s Federal System comprises of three tiers of government: Federal, 36 State
       governments and FCT, and 774 local governments. The sub-national fiscal framework in Ni-
       geria consists of expenditure responsibilities and tax assignments, inter-governmental fiscal
       transfers (federation and VAT accounts revenue sharing according to specific formulae and
       mechanisms), and a fiscal policy framework that seeks to ensure overall macroeconomic sta-
       bility. The expenditure responsibilities and tax assignments are established by the 1999 Con-
       stitution and other relevant legislation and policies. Inter-governmental fiscal transfers are
       based on revenue allocation formulae proposed by the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and
       Fiscal Commission and approved by the National Assembly. The FGN established a frame-
       work to control fiscal deficits and public sector borrowing through the Debt Management
       Office (DMO) Act of 2003, Federal Fiscal Responsibility Act (2007), Investment and Securities
       Act (2007), and External and Domestic Borrowing Guidelines (2012, revised).

       63.	    Subnational governments are responsible for over 40 percent of public expenditure
       but majority of their revenues are statutory transfers from the Federation Account. State
       and local governments together are responsible for an average of 43 percent of total public
       expenditure (2011-2016) (Figure 3.1) and the lion’s share of spending in health and education.
       However, the majority of revenues, including oil and gas and main non-oil taxes (corporate
       income tax, excises), are collected by the FGN into the federation account to be subsequently
       shared to different tiers of government as statutory transfers; VAT is collected by both FGN
       and States, but pooled and distributed by FAAC to the different tiers of government. Reve-
       nues collected and maintained by States - known as internally generated revenues (IGR)20
       – represented only 4 percent of total public revenues in 2011 and only 9 percent of total reve-
       nues accruing to the States (excluding Lagos21 and FCT). The States’ vertical fiscal gap (defined
       as [State Government (SG) share of Spending (%)- SG share of Revenues (%)] / [SG share of

        ment, 3 percent road taxes and 13 percent other taxes.
        21	 Lagos revenue structure is markedly different from the other 35 states as it raises significantly higher IGR. IGR represented
        63 percent of total revenues to Lagos in 2011.

The Case for Sustaining State Fiscal Reform                                                           Nigeria Biannual Economic Update


       Spending (%)]) is larger than in all OECD countries in 2011 (Figure 3.2). In Peru, which has the
       largest vertical fiscal gap in the OECD, subnational governments are responsible for 40 per-
       cent of spending while collecting 10 percent of tax revenue22.

       64.	    The subnational fiscal framework provides limited safeguards for prudent fiscal
       management and incentives for good fiscal performance at the state level. First, there are
       weak fiscal transparency and accountability mechanisms. Approved budgets are in many
       cases not publicly available, or when they are, the contents are not very clearly presented.
       States are not required to account for actual expenditures to the FGN, and budget implemen-
       tation reports and annual audited financial statements are mostly not published at all or
       published with a significant time lag. The absence of regular reliable and accurate financial
       reporting not only hinders evaluation of public expenditures but also monitoring of fiscal
       performance and risks. On the revenue side, the incentive to improve IGR collection has been
       low, given the relative size of statutory transfers, and when States have been able to borrow
       relatively freely to finance spending. Apart from Lagos, the tax administration systems at the
       state level are generally weak with limited investment made into them23. In terms of expen-
       ditures, there are no fiscal rules to limit the annual growth in recurrent spending or to ensure
       that capital spending and other development spending is prioritized.

       65.	     There are several formal rules on public sector borrowing at the State level, but
       many guidelines and rules were not fully adhered to before May 2015. Key rules include
       the following: (1) no commercial bank borrowing without approval from the Federal Ministry
       of Finance24; and (2) liquidity and solvency debt thresholds where States should only be able
       to borrow externally and from the domestic capital markets if their debt stock to revenue
       ratio is less than 50 percent25 and their debt service to revenue ratio is less than 40 percent26.
       However, adherence and enforcement of these guidelines was weak, with some States bor-
       rowing from commercial banks without prior approval before May 2015. In addition, there is
       an absence of controls on domestic arrears accumulation – salaries/pensions and contractor
       payments.



       3.2 Historical performance 2011 to 201427

       66.	    The fiscal performance of States (Figures 3.3-3.8) during 2011-2014 made them vul-
       nerable to the macro-fiscal shocks of 2015-16. In nominal terms, total state revenues stag-
       nated between 2011 and 2014 and fell as a share of national GDP. Total revenues of all States
       increased from 2011 levels in 2012 and 2013 before falling back again to 3.57 trillion Naira in
       2014. It declined from 5.5 percent of national GDP to 4.0 percent as FAAC allocation (mostly
       oil revenue sharing) fell from 3.9 percent to 2.7 percent of GDP, while VAT and IGR stagnated
       at 0.4 and 0.8 percent of GDP. IGR in all States except Lagos and FCT increased only slightly
       from an average of 9 percent of total revenues in 2011 to 14 percent in 2014; statutory trans-
       fers remain more than three-quarters of revenues. In only two States (Rivers with 31 percent
       and Lagos with 68 percent), IGR represented more than 30 percent of revenues in 2014.

       67.	    With limited growth of the resource envelope, state expenditures stagnated and de-
       clined as a share of national GDP. Total expenditures of all States increased from 2011 levels
       in 2012 and 2013 before falling back to 3.76 trillion Naira in 2014. It declined from 5.7 percent
       of national GDP to 4.2 percent in 2015. During this period, recurrent spending increased from
       48 percent to 60 percent of total spending, driven by increase in personnel spending, while
       capital spending fell from 52 percent to 40 percent of total spending. In nominal terms, capi-
       tal spending declined from 1.9 trillion Naira in 2011 to 1.5 trillion Naira in 2014, while person-
       nel spending increased from 0.55 trillion to 0.94 trillion.

       throughout the period at an average 29 percent of debt. Both commercial bank loans and
       domestic arrears were typically short-term, with the principal repaid or rolled over within
       one year.

       69.	    While the total State Debt to GDP ratio remained constant as a share of GDP, the rel-
       ative decline in revenue has meant that Debt to Revenue and Interest Payment to Revenue
       ratios for all States (aggregated) increased significantly. The Debt to Revenue ratio for all
       States (aggregated) increased from 45 percent in 2011 to 61 percent in 2014, higher than the
       debt threshold rule of 50 percent. Individually, 17 States (including FCT) had a Debt to Reve-
       nue ratio higher than 50 percent in 2014. The annual interest payment to revenue ratio for
       all States (aggregated) increased from 3 percent to 5 percent. Annual debt service payments
       excluding arrears to revenue ratio is estimated to have increased from 18 percent in 2012 to
       29 percent in 2014. Including arrears, debt service to revenue ratio is estimated to have in-
       creased from 32 to 41 percent in the same period.

       3.3 Recent historical performance 2015-1628 and Financial Assistance to
       States

       70.	    Government revenues are dominated by oil - representing around three quarters of
       total revenue prior to 2015. This dependency was not adequately addressed during the boom
       years so that total government revenues, which were already low at 10.5 percent of GDP in
       2014, declined to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2016. Unlike the previous crisis in 2008, there were
       insufficient buffers accumulated in the Excess Crude Account (ECA) to play a counter cyclical
       role. The collapse of oil revenues translated into significant revenue shortfalls at all tiers of
       government in 2016 (See Box 1).

            Box 1: Decline in Federation Account Revenues, Stagnation of Non-Oil Revenues and VAT

            Net* revenue accruing to the Federation Account includes all oil and gas revenues and
            some non-oil revenues (customs revenue, corporate taxes, and solid minerals revenue);
            and is the main revenue stream for all tiers of Government. The revenues are distrib-
            uted to the three tiers of government as follows: 52.68 percent accrues to the FGN (of
            which FGN retains 48.5 percent after transfers to special funds and the Federal Capital
            Territory (FCT)), 26.72 percent to the 36 state governments, and 20.6 percent to the
            local governments. In addition to the revenues accruing to the Federation Account,
            value-added tax (VAT) is also federally collected and then distributed to the Federal (15
            percent of which 14 is retained), state (50 percent), and local (35 percent) governments.

            Net Federation Account revenue nearly halved, falling from N5,462 billion in 2014 to
            N2,902 billion in 2016. This sharp drop was entirely driven by the decline in oil and
            gas revenues because of (a) the decline in global oil prices (from US$100.8/bbl in 2014
            to US$45.2/bbl in 2016); and (b) the lower oil production in 2016 (from 2.2 mb/d in 2014
            to 1.8 mb/d in 2016).

            Collection of non-oil revenues and VAT stagnated throughout this period. The tar-
            gets for non-oil revenues in 2016 had been increased ambitiously; but without any
            significant tax policy reforms, actual revenues did not increase, despite many efforts
            to strengthen tax administration. Only 56 percent of the budgeted amount of non-oil
            revenues was collected and only 55 percent of the budgeted VAT amount was collect-
            ed.




            * From gross revenue items, such as revenue collection agency fees, 13 percent derivation to oil producing states, JV
            cash calls, revenues in excess of specific targets and transfer to Excess Crude Account, and any subsidies are deducted
            to arrive at the net measure, which is then distributed per the formulae described.

       71.	     The reduction in statutory transfers led to a fiscal crisis among the States in 2015-
       16. Total revenue to GDP ratio for all States (aggregated) fell from 4.0 in 2014 to 3.0 percent
       in 2015, driven by a decline in FAAC allocation (excluding VAT) from 2.7 to 1.8 percent of
       GDP. VAT and IGR collection did not increase sufficiently to offset this decline. As total state
       expenditures fell only slightly from 4.2 in 2014 to 4.0 percent of GDP in 2015, the fiscal defi-
       cit increased significantly from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1 percent in 2015. While total
       expenditure in nominal terms stagnated in 2015, States reported 38 percent higher personnel
       spending in 2015 than compared to 2014, while there was a 16 percent drop in capital spend-
       ing – for the first-time personnel spending outstripped capital spending. As total revenue fur-
       ther declined to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2016, States had to reduce their expenditures – from
       3.8 trillion Naira (4 percent of GDP) to 3.5 trillion Naira (3.4 percent of GDP) to maintain their
       fiscal deficit below 1 percent. The spending cuts recorded mostly came from transfers and
       capital spending, which fell to 1.2 trillion Naira, nearly a third lower than it was in 2011.

       72.	     Increased borrowing needs saw total State debt increase from 2.4 percent in 2014 to
       4.0 percent of GDP by the end of 2016. Total State debt increased from 2.17 trillion Naira in
       2014 to 4.1 trillion in 201629. Domestic arrears on contractor payments pensions and salaries
       increased significantly from 660 billion Naira in 2014 to over 1 trillion Naira in 2016. , which
       would have impacted negatively on Commercial bank loans were restructured during the
       first set of financial assistance to States so declined from 583 billion Naira to 300 billion Naira.
       At the end of 2016, debt is estimated at just over 1 trillion Naira from the first FG financial
       assistance package and at just under 300 billion Naira from the second package (Budget Sup-
       port Facility). External loans also increased from 519 billion Naira to 904 billion Naira.

       73.	    The Debt to Revenue ratio for all States (aggregate) nearly doubled in one year to 112
       percent in 2015 and increased further to 162 percent in 2016, when all States (including FCT)
       are estimated to have breached the formal debt threshold of 50 percent. The annual interest
       payment to revenue ratio for all States (aggregated) increased from 5 percent to 10 percent.
       However, annual debt service payments excluding arrears to revenue ratio fell from 29 per-
       cent in 2014 to 20 percent in 2016 due to the restructuring of short-term commercial bank
       debt into longer-term instruments. Including arrears, debt service to revenue ratio is estimat-
       ed to have increased from 41 percent to 50 percent in the same period.

       74.	    The States’ fiscal crisis led to two financial assistance packages by the FGN. The first
       financial assistance package was approved in July 2015 with no conditions attached for ac-
       cessing the funds to the States. It included restructuring of existing short-term commercial
       bank loans into longer-term state bonds guaranteed by the FG with 23 States participating for
       a total of N573 bn (individual state amounts varied) in 2015, soft loans from CBN, and Excess
       Crude Account-backed loans (state amount varied). As the States’ fiscal situation continued to
       worsen in 2016, affected by the overall macroeconomic situation, a second assistance pack-
       age was needed. The second package, called the Budget Support Facility, was accompanied
       by the Fiscal Sustainability Plan (FSP) – a plan of 22 fiscal management reform actions - see
       Appendix 2 for details. Financed by special purpose government bonds sold to the private
       sector and guaranteed by the FGN, an estimated total of N489 bn was released to 35 states
       (excluding Lagos and FCT) in monthly disbursements over 12 months (June 2016 to May
       2017). The monthly disbursements to each state were supposed to be conditional on progress
       against each of the States FSP action plans30. While the second assistance package disburse-

        29	 2016 debt stock was derived from DMO data augmented with estimates of the second financial assistance
        program: the Budget Support Facility assuming participation from 35 States.
        30	And a monthly FAAC allocation threshold falling below N500 billion. Total gross allocation is defined as follows: statutory
        allocation, distribution by NNPC, distribution from foreign excess crude saving account to SURE-P, exchange gain difference,
        and VAT to be distributed to beneficiaries including federal, state, local government, derivation funds, Nigeria Customs Service
        (NCS), Excess Crude Account, FIRS, and Excess revenue and subsidy account.

       ments were to last only for 12 months - to the end of May 2017 - the reforms in the FSP are
       supposed to be sustained over the long-term.

       75.	     The FSP is comprehensive in scope and tries to address many of the key fiscal man-
       agement weaknesses at the state-level: weak fiscal transparency and accountability; poor
       IGR mobilization; inefficiencies in public spending; and weak compliance with debt manage-
       ment rules. If implemented successfully, the actions should strengthen States’ fiscal trans-
       parency, accountability and, ultimately, sustainability. The FSP reforms also reinforce each
       other with increased fiscal transparency and accountability contributing to sustainability
       by enabling monitoring of adherence to fiscal and debt rules, identification of fiscal pressures
       and risks, as well as underpinning improvements in the effectiveness of spending. Improving
       IGR performance will serve to increase the States’ total actual expenditures against budgets
       (thereby improving budget credibility), and make fiscal outcomes less vulnerable to shocks
       in oil revenue volatility. The actions to rationalize recurrent expenditure will help states to
       reduce borrowing requirements when faced with revenue shortfalls and protect capital ex-
       penditure. The debt management actions seek to strengthen compliance with existing debt/
       borrowing rules and complement with actions that support access to the domestic capital
       market for longer-term financing. The actions build on various PFM reforms which have
       been and are being undertaken by States, solidifying them into a set of common standards
       for fiscal management for all States.

       76.	    In parallel to the FSP, the Government has committed to the Open Government
       Partnership (OGP) which should strengthen further fiscal transparency and accountability
       mechanisms. In May 2016, President Buhari announced Nigeria’s joining of the OGP initia-
       tive. A Secretariat under the Ministry of Justice and a Steering Committee have been es-
       tablished, comprising MDAs, civil society representatives and organized private sector and
       professional associations. 14 national commitments at federal level, to be implemented from
       January 2017 to December 2019, have been identified, with 5 of them promoting fiscal trans-
       parency, open procurement, open contracting, access to information, asset disclosure, citizen
       engagement and empowerment. As some of the underlying principles of OGP (at least seven
       out of the 14 commitments) can be applied to States in Nigeria, there are initiatives to pilot the
       principles. States agreed to commit to the OGP at the National OGP Retreat in Kaduna on Oc-
       tober 24, 2016. Application of key OGP principles in States should enhance service delivery
       efficiency and effectiveness, reduce corruption through better accountability and transpar-
       ency, and empower citizens better.



       3.4 The Case for Sustaining State Fiscal Reforms31

       77.	    The need to strengthen fiscal performance and sustainability remain, as fiscal con-
       ditions are likely to remain challenging in the medium-term. With no further fiscal con-
       solidation, States’ fiscal and debt sustainability will likely continue to deteriorate. At pres-
       ent, States remain under considerable fiscal stress, with States requesting continuation of the
       Budget Support Facility beyond the original end date of May 2017. Under assumptions of a

       fragile economic recovery (with slightly higher oil price and production) and assuming no
       significant increase in non-oil revenues collected federally or by the States (IGR), total State
       revenue is projected to increase slightly to 2.8 percent of GDP by 2018, but will remain much
       lower than 2011-2014 levels. Furthermore, if we assume in this scenario the following: 1) No
       further rationalization of State expenditures with spending at least remaining constant in
       real terms; and 2) No financing constraints, total State fiscal deficits would remain around 1
       percent of GDP annually through the medium-term. This level of fiscal deficits would lead to
       an increase in total State debt stock to 5.4 percent of GDP by 2020, and an increase in the total
       State debt to revenue ratio to over 200 percent by 2020. This would lead to a higher share of
       state revenues being used for interest payments and debt servicing (especially if States bor-
       row on mostly commercial terms again), rather than development spending. In this scenario
       with no or very limited fiscal consolidation, States remain vulnerable and continue to repre-
       sent a significant source of fiscal risks and macroeconomic instability for the country.




       78.	   To prevent this scenario and further fiscal crises from materializing, States need to
       increase their internally generated revenues (IGR), manage recurrent spending pressures,
       prevent arrears accumulation and strengthen debt management. This means implementing
       key PFM and fiscal management reforms at the State level, including the full and sustained
       implementation of the FSP actions and fiscal transparency commitments of the OGP. The
       implementation of the FSP is ongoing with all States making some progress but is far from
       complete. The success of the FSP also requires Federal Government to strengthen its role, in

       particular in the monitoring and enforcement of guidelines and rules on state borrowing,
       and to support the States in implementing some of the actions. Since 2014, there has been a
       systematic process of quarterly monitoring by DMO of the States debt stock and control by
       the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on borrowing activities from commercial banks.
