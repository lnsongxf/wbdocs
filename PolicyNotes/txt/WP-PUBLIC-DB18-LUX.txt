About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      payment must be presented. The tax stamp can also be obtained from the
      One-stop shop information center.
      • For non-residents and persons residing in Luxembourg for fewer than 10
      years, a recent notarized certi cate of non-bankruptcy.
      • Articles of association (executed or draft) for a commercial company.
      • School certi cates or professional diplomas (certi ed by the institution)
      required for the intended activity. Otherwise, proof of relevant professional
      experience such as an EU certi cate or certi cate of registration with a social
      security authority.
      • An a davit on the exercise of any management posts previously held in
      Luxembourg, for veri cation of non-bankruptcy.
      • The applicant’s identity card (copy).
      • The applicant’s police record or a davit. Note: This applies to non-
      residents and persons residing in Luxembourg for less than 10 years. In
      practice, the Ministry of the Economy and Foreign Trade tends however to
      request the provision of a police record or a davit to every applicant
      although not required as such.


      The business permit application can be submitted before executing the
      notary deed because the Ministry of the Economy checks the draft articles of
      association—the company name, business purpose, and identity of directors
      and o cers for compliance with the provisions of the applicable law.
      Generally, the business license/establishment permit application and notary
      deed processes start more or less at the same time and are pursued
      simultaneously. Although the company incorporation process requires a
      notary, the founder may directly register the company with di erent
      administrations and obtain identi cation numbers and the business
      license/establishment permit.

      Since October 2011, business license requests can be handed in online at
      www.guichet.lu. The required documents are the same ones. They all need to
      be transformed into a PDF and attached to the online form. In order to be
      able to deposit the business license online, the applicant is required to have
      a LUXTRUST certi cate in order to sign the application form electronically.

        Upon usually 24 hours within registration, the Trade and Companies

        accompanies the company during its corporate life (matricule). This number
        forms the basis for all other identi cation numbers to be issued by the
        administration for direct taxes (tax number), the administration for indirect
        taxes (VAT number), or the social security service (pay-as-you-earn number
        and employer number). Applications can be led for both VAT and social
        security at the one-stop, which distributes the forms to the relevant
        administrations. The company's registration with the Chamber of Commerce
        is done automatically.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Upon receiving the application, Creos Luxembourg S.A. will prepare the
      technical conditions for connecting the client's premises to the grid. It will

      Agency : Creos Luxembourg S.A.

      The client accepts the o er and estimate of fees provided by the utility. The
      utility will then request an excavation permit from the local road authorities
      (Administration des Ponts et Chaussées) and in parallel, will draft a
      connection agreement and a contract of usage of network. The client will
      sign both contracts and send them back to Creos.

      The client will be in charge of excavating the road crossing. They will also be
      responsible for repairing the road once Creos has laid down the cable.

      The client's contractor will also need to ll out the authorization provided by
      Creos con rming he has completed the works according to the agreed
      conditions.

      Agency : Electricity supplier on the free market

      For electricity to be provided, it is necessary to have a supply contract with a
      supplier. The network manager and provider functions are separated in
      Luxembourg (based on European law) and Creos does not act as a supplier.
      The customer therefore needs to sign a contract with a supplier of his choice
      on the market as soon as he has enough technical details of its
      consumption. If he does not do so before the nal consumption, a default
      provider will automatically be designated by the regulatory body. The client
      will still be able to change suppliers at no extra costs thereafter.

      Agency : Creos Luxembourg S.A.

      Creos will then inspect the contractor's internal installation as well as the
      road opening. Upon satisfactory inspection, it will lay down the low-voltage
      cable to connect the client's premises to the grid and install the meter.
                                                                                                                                 Page 21

      as per common practice, the parties will visit a civil law notary so he can draft
      and authenticate the notarial deed. The sale is complete between the
      parties, and ownership is acquired as of right by the buyer with respect to
      the seller, as soon as the property and the price have been agreed upon,
      although the property has not yet been delivered or the price paid (Article
      1583 of the Civil Code). As a sale of real estate must be registered (which
      triggers the payment of registration taxes) and recorded in the mortgage
      registry in order to be enforceable vis-à-vis third parties and as only duly
      certi ed deeds may be entered in the register, the sale must be recorded in
      a notarial deed ("acte de vente").



      The Civil Law notary is deemed a public o cial with powers delegated by the
      State to authenticate the deeds he drafts and provides complete security to
      the contracts he supervises. The authenticity of the deeds grants the parties
      an undisputable date and content in Court. The law imposes a personal
      liability on the notary for his professional acts which is more extensive than
      that of other branches of the legal profession.



      There are 34 Civil Law notaries, 18 of those in Luxembourg canton, in the
      Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg and the sale may be drawn up in front of
      anyone of them. This study assumes that parties would call on day one and
      receive an appointment for the same or following day.

                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

      Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                       declare Mirage bankrupt and bankruptcy proceedings will commence.

Outcome              piecemeal sale    During a bankruptcy procedure, the operations would as a matter of principle stop and, at
                                       the end of the proceedings, the company is likely to be liquidated and its assets sold
                                       piecemeal. Few companies continue operating after completion of the bankruptcy
                                       proceedings.

Time (in years)      2.0               Mirage's management will file an application for controlled management procedure,
                                       supported by a list of creditors. The court will hold a hearing and one of the judges from the
                                       section on commercial matters will be appointed to report on the financial situation of the
                                       company. This can be done with the assistance of an expert. When the report is finalized, the
                                       court will decide whether to accept or reject the application for controlled judicial
                                       management. If the application is accepted, one or more administrators will be appointed by
                                       the court. The administrator will take inventory of the assets and assess the financial
                                       situation of the company. After that, the administrator will prepare a reorganization or
                                       liquidation plan. The plan will be forwarded to the creditors, who have to inform the court
                                       within 2 weeks whether they approve or reject the plan. If the plan is rejected, the court will
                                       declare the debtor bankrupt. The bankruptcy judgment will be published in two local
                                       newspapers and individual notice will be given to known creditors. A receiver will be
                                       appointed. Creditors must file their claims within allocated time (usually 15-20 days), if the
                                       receiver disputes any of the claims, they will be litigated in court. After all claims have been
                                       confirmed, the receiver must convene a meeting of the creditors and present his report on
                                       the bankruptcy. The assets can only be sold with court's authorization. A secured creditor
                                       may acquire the assets from the estate and set-off its claim.

Cost (% of           14.5              Major expenses will include attorneys' fees (up to 10%) and remuneration of the

Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
