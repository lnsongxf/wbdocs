About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      of TND 250.00.


      The construction license le must include the following:
      • An application
      • Architectural plans approved by an architect and consistent with local
      building code requirements and land development regulations
      • A safety le approved by an engineer registered with the Tunisian
      Association of Engineers.
      • Proof of property rights
      • Tax discharge
      • A topographical survey prepared by the quali ed topographic services or
      an approved topographer
      • Work design documents (dossier de co rage)


      Once license documents are approved by the Construction Licensing
      Commission, BuildCo must submit the structural design documents to the
      Commission signed by an engineer registered with the Tunisian Association
      of Engineers.
      • An order of alignment delivered by the Ministry of Equipment, if the
      building is located on a classi ed road or an urban avenue

      After 21 days, and in the absence of a response from the municipal
      authority, the construction license is automatically granted. Though the time
      limit is 21 days, permits are issued on average in 4 weeks (between 4 and 6
      weeks). However, according to regulations, municipal services reserve the
      right of demolition if the construction takes place without authorization. The
      license is valid for 3 years. Renewal is not required if construction has
      started but is not completed before the expiration of the license. A Ministry
      of Housing and Equipment decree issued in April 2007 introduced two
      changes a ecting the submission of building permits.

      First, the architect responsible for the building works must be present to
      submit the application and explain the project to the building authorities in
      the municipality.

      Second, a “ che technique” signed and stamped by an architect admitted to
      the Ordre des Architects de Tunisie is now required with all building permit
      applications. Both of these requirements were introduced to avoid forgery of
      architect stamps on building plans.

       Agency : Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG)

       STEG will inspect the site once it has processed the application documents.
       There is no need to request it. The process of preparing the estimate is
       distinct and independent from the technical control process (preparation de
       dossier technique). While there is no inspection for the estimate
       preparation, there will likely be an inspection related to the technical le.
       One the visit of the site is done, the technical data are entered into a
       software in order to calculate automatically the quote.

       transformer
       Agency : Electrical Contractor

       The customer hires an electrical contractor that is registered with the utility.
       The electrical contractor purchases the transformer station and constructs
       the beton structure (the room) for the transformer and installs the
       transformer. Most of the material including the transformer is readily
       available on the local market. After the signature of the contract, the utility
       provides the meter and the meter is installed by the electrical contractor.

   4   Receive inspection of installed transformer and nal connection from                   22 calendar days    TND 13,300
       STEG
       Agency : Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG)

       The connection from the transformer to the grid is made by the utility.
       Before the nal external connection works, the utility inspects the
       installation of the transformer. The nal connection is done. Everything is
       done by the same department. A clearance for the underground connection
       has to be obtained from the municipality. However, the clearance for the
       underground connection is an internal procedure between utility and
       municipality without the intervention of the customer.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      (CPF employee) at the Conservation de la Propriété Foncière after
      consultation with the property registry services. Both parties are summoned
      to sign it. Then the contract is notarized by a public notary or redacteur.
      Costs for this procedure vary according to who prepares the contract
      agreement. Businesses considered in the Doing Business case are likely to
      consult a lawyer even if fees are slightly higher. The lawyer fees are set freely
      between the parts while the notary fees vary from 1% to 5% of the property
      value. It is useful to note that redacteurs charge a minimum of TND 30 and a
      maximum of TND 300 for their service depending on the property and type
      of contract. In the case study 300TND would be the applicable fee for the
      preparation. The fees charged by the redacteurs are based on the decree N°
      92-2114 of November 30, 1992.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
