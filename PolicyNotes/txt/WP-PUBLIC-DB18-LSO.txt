About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : Maseru City Council

      In August 2016, Maseru City Council launched an online platform to request
      the planning and construction permits online. The documents to be
      submitted are (i) a proof of ownership; (ii) site plan; (iii) The layout, section
      and elevation drawings; (iv) sanitation; (v) EIA or brief clearance; (vi) re
      evacuation plan. Additional documents may be required depending if the
      building falls into category 1 or 2.


      Payment is made in person at the Financial department and the architect
      must provide a proof of payment for the process to continue.


      Only architects are allowed to request a building permit.

  4   Receive setting-out inspection                                                         1 day                    no charge
      Agency : Municipality

      A lack of resources and capacity constrains the Municipality’s ability to carry
      out inspections during the construction phase.


      The law does not mandate inspections during construction.

  5   Request water connection services                                                      1 day                    LSL 4,000
      Agency : Water and Sewage Authority



  6   Receive on-site inspection by water company                                            1 day                    no charge
      Agency : Water and Sewage Authority

      After the inspection is completed, BuildCo is given the estimates used to pay
      the connection fee (recorded in the previous procedure).

  7   Connect to water services                                                              30 days                  no charge
      Agency : Water and Sewage Authority

      During construction the company usually already has a temporary
      connection. BuildCo would then request a nal one, in which case they would
      simply need the meter at the end. Temporary and nal connection takes
      around one month. Compared to other service providers, water connection
      is fairly speedy.

       Occupancy Certi cate
       Agency : Maseru City Council

       According to Article 28 of the Building Control Act of 1995, obtaining a
       certi cate of occupancy prior to occupying any building. The owner or
       builder must rst inform the Maseru City Council of the completion of work.
       14 days after this noti cation, the Maseru City Council will conduct a nal
       inspection in order to issue the certi cate of occupancy.

   9   Receive nal inspection from Maseru City Council                                      1 day                      no charge
       Agency : Maseru City Council

       After completing the nal inspection, the Maseru City Council issues a
       certi cate authorizing the use of the warehouse. By law, obtaining the
       occupancy permit is 2 weeks (excluding the waiting time to receive the nal
       inspection). However, the occupancy permit is practically never or rarely
       issued, which breeds safety concerns.

      After depositing the application, the customer has to wait for the external
      inspection and after the external inspection for the estimate. Once the
      customer has accepted the quotation, he/she signs the contract and pays
      the quotation. The customer pays the quotation at the front desk of the

      Once the client has paid the quotation, the utility has to appoint a contractor
      from its existing list of registered contractors. Once the contractor has been
      awarded the contract, the contractors buy the relevant material. Material
      used to be provided by the utility, but lately contractors buy the material.
      The external connection works themselves take about one month. The meter
      is also installed by the electrical contractor. The meter is installed at the
      same time as when the connection is done.

      Upon completion of the construction works (external works), the customer
      shall open an account at the utility. When the electrical contractor has
       nished the external connection works as per LEC standards they
      immediately report to LEC that the work is done. LEC would then go to the
      warehouse to inspect the works and to commission the meter (this is a sort
      of registration of the meter) and hand out a form/paper to the customer.
      LEC goes within 24hrs after the electrical contractor has reported that he is
      done with the house. The commissioning takes less than an hour.

      Administration Authority ("LAA") prepares another form (Form LB) which is
      attached to the deed of transfer. The application is addressed to the
      Director General of the LAA who signs the consent for land transactions
      according to Section 12 (1) (a) (ii) of the Lands Act of 2010.

                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants

                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Labor Market Regulation
Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
