About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       compulsory saving scheme for private-sector employees between the age of
       16-55 years, non-governmental organizations, and government parastatal
       bodies that are not covered by the government pension scheme. Under the
       Act, all employers with more than 5 employees are obliged to pay an NSSF
       contribution of 10% of the employees gross monthly salary. This procedure
       takes 1-7 days. Registration forms for NSSF can be downloaded from the
       NSSF website.

    Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June

      Agency : UMEME

      Umeme inspects the premises of the client to verify the requirement and the
      existing infrastructure. There is a speci c inspector/surveyor for industrial
      connection. There is only one to cover all the country. There are 6 others
      who cover the 6 regions of Uganda for simple connections. The surveyor
      draws the route of the power lines. Since there is no planning of the city,
      there is some delay in determining the roads as it often cross private
      property. In that case, Umeme helps the client to obtain a way leave.
      Umeme receives around 30 requests by month; amongst them 10 require
      the surveyor. Once the route is determined, the surveyor lists the required
      materials and does the drawings for the extension of the MV network. The
      costing is then done by planning engineers for the low voltage and by the
      central planning department for the medium voltage. The quotation is then
      given to the customer with the list of materials and the labor costs for the
      connection. The customer can now choose an electrical contractor to do the
      works. There is a list of prequali ed contractors by Umeme. There have been
      over 40 contractors approved in the past years.

      The approval of the plans is done at the planning department. Once the
      plans are approved, the contractor starts the construction of the
      connection. The approval of the plans is very fast as the contractors have
      been working closely with the planning department.
      Once the construction begins or the contractor noti es the planning
      department who will transmit the le to the local o ce.

                      The process starts by requesting a search of the property in the Registry of
                      Lands. The requester has to ll out a form indicating the details of the
                      property to be searched. The Registry gives a Bank Advice Form (BAF) with
                      the amount to be paid, which one takes to the bank to pay in full. The
                      Consent Form has a dual purpose, because it is the same form that is used
                      for the payment of taxes, so even in instances where the land is owned in
                      freehold and there is no need to obtain consent to transfer, the same form
                      will be used to determine tax payments owed and to make payment.

                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

courts (calendar days)                                between 2 domestic businesses. The case study assumes that the court
                                                      hears an expert on the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes

  Time for trial and to obtain the judgment
                                                      To make the data comparable across economies, Doing Business uses
  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                      several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the       - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                   and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                       economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                      - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                      - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                    equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)            - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                      commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                      - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                               - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                              - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                      movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer            Explanation

Proceeding          receivership      A receiver may be appointed under the terms of the security document and the Insolvency
                                      Act, 2011. The receiver will take custody of the property under receivership and carry out
                                      other obligations specified in the Act. After preparing the abstracts prescribed in the
                                      Insolvency Act, the receiver may find a buyer that will continue operating the business.

Outcome             going concern     Assuming that there will be a receiver appointed under the debt instrument which will seek
                                      for potential buyers of the company, the sale will take place after approximately 2 years and
                                      the business will continue operating as a going concern.

Time (in years)     2.2               Receivership commences when a receiver accepts the appointment. The receiver is then
                                      required to immediately notify the debtor of the appointment and also notify the public
                                      notice and the Registrar of Companies of the appointment no later than 14 days of
                                      commencement of the receivership. Following the notification, the receiver then commences
                                      the exercise of his powers, including taking custody of the property under receivership,
                                      registration in his names all land and other assets under receivership. This takes
                                      approximately 30 working days. The receiver is required, within 40 working days after his
                                      appointment, to prepare a preliminary report on the state of affairs of the property in
                                      receivership. The preliminary report must be sent to the debtor, all persons in whose
                                      interests the receiver is appointed and the official receiver within 5 working days after its
                                      preparation. The receiver will then manage the property, while trying to find a suitable buyer
                                      and then arranging the sale of the assets. Following the sale of the property, the receiver is
                                      required to deal with the proceeds as provided for under the Insolvency Act.

Cost (% of          29.5              For a receivership procedure, the cost is approximately 30% of the value of the estate to
estate)                               resolve the case. Attorneys' fees (10%) and the receiver’s fees (10%) will represent the major
                                      components of the cost associated to this procedure. The rest would be fees of accountants,
                                      auctioneer’s fees and court expenses.
