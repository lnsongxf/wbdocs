                Private sector participation in                           was invested in increasing access to electricity

                rural electrification in Africa                           in developing countries, against the $45 billion

                is just 35 percent; the rural rate is considerably        to simplify and accelerate the expensive and
                lower (World Bank and IEA 2015). At its founding          time-consuming process of rural electrification

                Note: In a greenfield concession, a private entity builds and operates a new facility. In a brownfield concession, a private entity takes over an existing
                facility or asset, which is usually government-owned.

                                                             Concessionaires are obligated to connect households in their service area that request a connection
                                                             and pay the relevant connection fees.
                              Main sources of finance        For up-front capital investment, 60–80 percent of the financing is provided by the government (or
                              for investment                 donors). The remainder (20–40 percent) is provided by the private sector.

                                                             The private sources of finance are often informal (for example, own savings, remittances, business
                                                             partners, friends, family).
                              How costs are recovered        The private portion of the investment cost and operational and maintenance costs are recovered
                                                             through tariffs.
                              How tariffs are set            Concessionaires are generally free to propose tariffs that cover their costs and a reasonable rate of
                                                             return. Once the tariffs are agreed upon, they may be lightly regulated either by a rural electrification
                                                             agency or an electricity sector regulator.
                              Type and extent of subsidy     Usually the only subsidy is paid up-front by the government as a proportion of the capital costs.
                              How concessions are            Concessions are awarded by the government or the rural electrification agency (if one exists) on the
                              awarded                        basis of proposals submitted by private firms, in response to expressions of interest or requests for
                                                             proposals published by the government. Proposals cover the private entities’ plans and their request
                                                             for start-up funding. To date, such proposals have not prespecified the precise settlement or bundles

                 Specific obligations         Concessions are awarded on the basis of the number of households that the private parties
                 related to electrification   propose to electrify in the first three years of the concession. The winning bidders have contractual
                                              obligations of between 7,500 and 27,000 connections each.
                 Main sources of finance      The government provides significant up-front funding of capital costs.
                 for investment
                                              In Senegal, the share of private financing ranges from 22 to 68 percent of the total financing.
                 How costs are recovered      Concessionaires must recover their investment costs and the costs of ongoing operations and
                                              maintenance through their tariffs.
                 How tariffs are set          A tariff system is agreed with the regulator (CRSE).

                                              For small residential subscribers, the tariff is fixed depending on the number of lighting and power
                                              outlet points.

                                              For subscribers who require more power, billing is done according to measured consumption.
                 Type and extent of subsidy   The concessionaires receive a subsidy from the rural electrification agency (ASER) for a portion
                                              of their initial investment cost. They do not receive a subsidy of their ongoing operation and
                                              maintenance costs.
                 How the concessions          The concession contract is awarded following an international tender. The winner is the operator
                 are awarded                  that proposes to connect the largest number of households during the concession’s first three years,
                                              in return for a pre-determined output-based subsidy.
                 Why Senegal chose            Senegal has attempted several times to increase private sector participation in electricity so as to
                 this model                   reduce the burden on the state of subsidizing the operations of the national utility, SENELEC.
