About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : Planning Authority

      Required documentation:
      • Architectural plans
      • Subdivision form (eight copies), completed in full with all relevant sections
      completed, in accordance with the Land Survey Act
      • Application for permit for custody/possession/use of containers on the
      site, if applicable.
      • Application for environmental impact assessment (required for all projects)
      • Declaration by agents and owners (original document)
      • Title deed (not older than 6 months from the date of copy)
      • Location plans
      • Cadastral layout
      • Site plan

      • Position of all existing features
      • Position of waste water facilities
      • Water and sewer services
      • Electricity
      • Calculation of fees

      The cost of the approval processing would be SCR 32,515.00 (SCR 25.00 per
      sq. m.).


      All plans are drawn up by the agent. A licensed agent (either an architect or a
      draughts person, depending on the size of the project) must lead the
      construction and obtain the approval of plans and occupancy permit. When
      applying for project approval with the Planning Authority, the licensed agent
      must verify that the information provided on the site plan is correct and
      accurate. Both the owner and agent take mutual responsibility to convey to
      each other that the conditions of the plans must be complied with. For
      buildings of about 250 sq. m. or more, an architect is required. The
      architect's fee depends on the rm, size of the project, and scope of work.
      Generally, about 2 -- 4% of the project value might be charged.
                                                                                                                                 Page 14

       The permit application, along with all plans and required documentation can
       now be uploaded online, but hard copies must also be brought in to the
       Planning O ce.


       The plans are forwarded to the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of
       Health the Public Utility Corporation (electricity provider), and the Fire
       Department (CFO), for approval, before being returned to the Planning
       Authority. Each agency must return their comments to the Planning
       Authority within 14 days, although this time limit is not always respected. The
       Planning Authority Board then meets every Friday to review the applications
       and issue the approvals.


       No less than 48 hours before the start of construction, the builder must
       notify the Planning Authority, which monitors the construction work. A
       Planning Authority employee is assigned to the project for inspections and
       as a contact point in case of questions. Employees at the Planning Authority
       are divided by region. During the course of the construction, the builder
       must provide noti cation to the Planning Authority at certain stages (e.g.,
       give written notice that the drain/sewer/septic tank is ready for inspection
       and provide at least 48 hours’ notice before the commencement of concrete
       pouring). The Planning Authority usually, but not always, conducts
       inspections at those stages and also conducts additional inspections on a
       weekly basis (all of them unannounced, unless requested by the builder or
       the owner).

       Authority
       Agency : Planning Authority

       After the project is approved, the agent must submit the structural design to
       the Planning Authority 28 days prior to the commencement of construction.
       The Planning Authority will then review and approve the plans. Often times,
       there is a lot of back and forth interaction about revisions to the structural
       plans between the Planning Authority and the applicant.


       The Planning Authority conducts the project approval before the approval of
       the structural plans because it is costly to hire an engineer to draw the
       structural plans. Therefore, if the project is not approved, it is best for the
       applicant to know early on before hiring an engineer and spending the
       related costs.

       Agency : Planning Authority

       After the structural design is approved, BuildCo is required to notify the
       Planning Authority of the start of construction by completing a control
       notice form at least 48 hours in advance. The notice includes the names of
       the builder and owner, their contact information, and the date of
       commencement of construction of the project, in accordance with the Town
       and Country Planning (Building) Regulations 1975. The applicant must also
       attach the company’s license, as well as the engineer’s certi cate. The Notice
       of Commencement must be hand-delivered. However, this requirement, as
       well as subsequent noti cation requirements are not strictly enforced by the
       Planning Authority.

      In addition to inspections done at certain stages of construction, the
      Planning Authority is required to conduct unscheduled inspections from
      time to time, but this does not always happen in practice.

      The supervising engineer must submit a notice of completion along with a
       nal report stating that the building has been built according to the
      approved plans and regulations. After the Planning Authority has been
      noti ed of the completion of construction, it schedules a joint inspection
      with the Fire Department and Ministry of Health and Environment to assess
      whether the occupancy permit can be granted.

      Agency : Planning Authority; Fire Department; Ministry of Health and
      Environment

      The inspection takes 1 day, but the scheduling takes about 2 weeks. The
      inspection is a joint one with di erent departments and ministries,
      depending on the nature of the project -- in the case of a warehouse, it will
      usually be the Planning Authority, the Fire Department and the Ministry of
      Health and Environment.

      Environment

      The Planning Authority, the Fire Department and the Ministry of Health and
      Environment give their opinion on the project. Once their recommendations
      have been received, the le is forwarded to the Director of the Planning
      Authority who signs the approval. The occupancy permit is generally issued 1
      week after the nal inspection.

      The cost of the meter is included in the water connection fee. Assuming that
      meters are available, the connection can be obtained within 2-3 weeks.
      However, meter availability is an issue, and a waiting time of 1 -- 6 months to
      obtain the meter is not unlikely. The actual connection works are done by
      the contractor, not the utility company. The installation of the water meter
      costs SCR 1,580 and a SCR 500 refundable deposit.

      For the case study warehouse, it would likely be built in an area that is

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      supply. So if the application for connection is approved the customer
      automatically is bound by the supply agreement.

      When the application is approved, the customer must complete and submit
      an electrical contractor notice form, which states the name of the contractor
      that will be hired to conduct the connection works, as well as the
      remuneration paid to the contractor. The connection fee is paid at the
      approval of the application.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      A notary is required by law to conduct this Procedure. Parties make an
      appointment one day and usually visit the following day. Prior to the sales
      agreement, the buyer needs to grant (by resolution of the Board of
      Directors) a director or other representative the authority to buy the land at
      the agreed price, on behalf of the company. The seller has to do the same.
      Standard transfer agreements can be found in the Land Registration Act.

  3   Deposit sales agreement with Stamp Duty Commission (property                         5 days                  no cost
      registry)
      Agency : Stamp Duty Commission, Property registry

      The notary deposits 3 original copies (one each for seller, buyer and notary).
      The documents have to be submitted within 1 month after execution of the
      contract. If not, a validating duty (double of stamp duty, i.e. 10%) is charged.
      At the registry, the parcel number is checked and the stamp duty calculated
      (5% of property value) and approved. After a senior ling registrar has
      reviewed the documents and value, the le is sent to the Registrar for review
      and approval. If there is any doubt about the accuracy of the value, which
      may happen in about 40% of cases, the documents are sent to the
      evaluation o ce at the Lands O ce. The valuation o ce would
      subsequently re-assess the property value and transfer the documents back
      to the Registrar. The surveying and valuation takes on average 1-2 months.
      Once the Registrar has approved, the notary returns for payment. He is
      either informed by phone or checks independently. This surveying and
      valuation would not apply to the transfer of the case study.

  4   Pay registration fees to Stamp Duty Commission and register property                 25 days                 5% property value +
      title                                                                                                        100 SCR (Registration

      Once the stamp duty and fees are paid, the transfer is registered
      (‘presentation of documents’) and the documents stamped. The Registrar
      approves the transfer by signature and the document is returned to the land
      section for dispatch. The legal time limit for registration (including approval
      of stamping) is 1 month, and it practice takes slightly less time.

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
