Preface
Financial capability, as defined by the World Bank Group (WBG) and in this report, is the capacity to
act in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic and environmental conditions. It
encompasses knowledge (literacy), attitudes, skills and behavior of consumers with respect to understanding,
selecting, and using financial services that fit their needs (World Bank 2013d).
Financial capability has become a priority for policy makers seeking to promote beneficial financial
inclusion and to ensure financial stability and functioning financial markets. Today people are required
to take increasing responsibility for managing a variety of risks over their life cycle. Those who make sound
financial decisions and who effectively interact with financial services providers are more likely to achieve
their financial goals, hedge against financial and economic risks, improve their household’s welfare, and
support economic growth. Boosting financial capability has therefore emerged as a policy objective that
complements governments’ financial inclusion and consumer protection agendas. To this end, policy makers
are increasingly using surveys as diagnostic tools to identify financial capability areas that need improvement
and vulnerable segments of the population that could be targeted with specific interventions.
The Zambian authorities have implemented the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) (phase I
and II) to seek a stable and market-based financial sector that supports the “efficient mobilization and
allocation of resources necessary for economic diversification, sustainable growth and poverty
reduction”. 2 As part of this plan, financial inclusion, financial capability and consumer protection (FCCP) are
important priorities for the Zambian government. FCCP are critical elements in building a trusted formal
inclusive financial system and the Zambian authorities are seeking to identify sustainable methods of
delivering financial education through effective partnerships. As the Zambian government’s financial inclusion
initiatives allow more Zambians to access a wider range of financial services from a variety of formal financial
institutions, the population will need to acquire knowledge and develop skills in order to make better financial
decisions.
In response to a request from the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), the World Bank has implemented a financial
capability survey. This survey constitutes a key diagnostic tool that aims to guide the authorities in
developing a detailed implementation action plan for the National Strategy on Financial Education for Zambia
(NSFE). 3 Moreover, it will help the authorities set quantifiable and concrete targets, and assess the
effectiveness of future financial capability enhancing programs.
The key findings and recommendations presented in this report cover three main areas: 1. Financial
Inclusion, 2. Financial Capability, and 3. Financial Consumer Protection. The remaining chapters are
structured as follows. Chapter 1 explores the financial inclusion landscape in Zambia. Chapter 2 gives an
overview of Zambian levels of financial capability, specifically financial knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors
of respondents. Chapter 3 explores the relationship between financial inclusion and financial capability. The
last chapter investigates whether the products used by financially included individuals are effectively meeting
their needs.

 institution (a bank, a microfinance institution (MFI), or an e-money agent), a commonly used
 metric for international comparisons. Financial inclusion in Zambia has nearly doubled in the last
 ten years. During this period, formal financial inclusion has risen steadily from 21.3 percent in 2005 to
 40.2 percent in 2016. However, compared to other lower-middle income countries, Zambia fares less
 favorably on average in terms of financial inclusion, commercial bank branches’ accessibility and
 domestic credit provided by the financial sector.
 Across the main socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, income level was found to
 have the most significant impact on financial inclusion, followed by whether or not adults were
 located in rural areas and their gender differences. Only 29.4 percent of the lowest income quartile
 are financially included compared to 52.5 percent of the highest income quartile. Moreover, 35.5
 percent of rural people are financially included as opposed to 46.1 percent for urban residents. In terms
 of gender differences, 37.2 percent of women were found to be financially included compared to 43.1
 percent for men.
 Zambia’s banking sector accounts for over 90 percent of financial system assets. Its strength
 is matched by high awareness of these institutions. Almost everybody knows about services
 offered by banks and by national saving and credit institutions. 93 percent of adults currently use,
 or have in the past used, their services, but only 36 percent currently have an account, which may
 suggest a low satisfaction among past (but not current) users. Bank usage exhibited the same pattern
 across the main socioeconomic and demographic characteristics as for financial inclusion more
 generally. The biggest disparity is a 17-percentage point difference between adults in the highest
 income quartile and those in the lowest quartile. There is a 6-percentage point difference between
 urban and rural residents and a 3-percentage point difference between men and women.
 Nine out of ten adults know about services offered by Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), 76
 percent have used their services in the past and 53 percent currently utilize them. Zambia is
 among the top 10 remittance receivers among Sub-Saharan economies, with remittances representing
 about 0.3 percent of GDP (USD 0.1 billion).
 Although 76 percent of adults know about e-money services, only 29 percent have used them
 in the past and 15 percent continue to utilize them, suggesting a possible lack of trust in this
 type of service; such services are mostly employed by rich men living in urban areas. 22 percent
 more rich adults make use of e-money services than the poor, 15 percent more urban people rely on
 such methods in comparison to their rural peers and 6 percent more men than women utilize such
 instruments. The usage rate may be associated to the fact that compared to other African countries,
 Zambia has a low cellular penetration rate (75 percent compared to the regional average of 91 percent)
 and doesn’t fare well as far as the level of taxes associated to mobile services is concerned, which can
 be an important barrier to increasing digital inclusion.
 Very few Zambians utilize insurance products, especially poor and rural adults. Knowledge of
 insurance products is quite low in Zambia: only 18 percent of adults are familiar with these products.
 Only 5 percent of the population have purchased an insurance product. About 1 percent of the poorest
 Zambians currently use insurance, a striking difference with the richest category (8 percent). Moreover,
 only 2 percent of the rural population is protected by insurance, as opposed to 8 percent for urban
 people.
 MFI products are known and used by very few people (4 percent). People utilizing MFI services
 are predominantly poor rural men. Very few Zambians, especially poor and rural adults, use MFI
 products. Only 14 percent of adults are familiar with these products and only 4% currently use them.
 About two-thirds of adults currently have debts, mostly as a result of informal instruments only
 (82 percent) compared with about 8 percent having taken only formal credits and 18 percent
 having a mix of formal and informal credits. Most of the informal debt is used by rural residents and
 the poorest segments of the population.

                                                     4
   Half of adults have a financial product for saving or save money and most of them are rich and
   from urban areas. Furthermore, most people report using formal products. Among 50 percent of
   the adults who save money, 52 percent use only formal products, 28 percent utilize only informal ones
   and the balance (20 percent) have a combination of formal and informal savings. Propensity to save is
   predominantly higher first among the rich (29% more than the poor in absolute terms) and secondly
   among people living in urban areas (19% more than rural in absolute terms).
   The approximately 3.8 million financially excluded adults – those who use no formal financial
   products or services – in Zambia are disproportionately female, poor, and living in rural areas.
   The main reason given by unbanked adults for not owning a formal account is the lack of sufficient
   funds (31 percent), followed by high account fees (17 percent), institutions being too far away (15
   percent) and lack of trust (15 percent). More men than women said that the main barriers were lack of
   sufficient money and institutions being too far away, with more women than men citing high account
   fees and lack of trust.


Recommendations4
Develop policies that encourage the provision of basic financial services, with transaction accounts at
no or low cost, including through cooperation with ZamPost, the national postal operator. 48 percent of
unbanked respondents report that high costs are a main barrier to owning formal accounts. This suggests that
the costs associated with having these accounts remain considerably high for a significant portion of the
population or that the availability of accounts at no or low costs are not widely known. A recent survey5 found
that almost all countries that provided information stated that a form of basic account was offered in their
jurisdiction. The survey also found that, although a number of countries have introduced or are considering
introducing legislation that gives citizens a right to a basic bank account, in the majority of countries the provision
of basic accounts is a market initiative. In most of these cases, basic accounts are being offered via banks. In
some countries, post offices are also involved in the provision of such basic accounts, suggesting that in Zambia,
cooperation with ZamPost on the provision of basic accounts should be expanded. To mitigate the risk that the
uptake and usage of basic accounts may be very low, international experience in countries such as India or the
Philippines shows that the introduction of basic accounts needs to be complemented with public awareness
campaigns about the benefits of accounts.

Promote the development and provision of financial services geared toward specific needs of
customers, including through providing cheaper avenues for low income consumers to obtain mobile
phones. Mobile or agent banking can dramatically reduce the costs of delivering financial services, particularly
in low-density and remote areas. Moreover, it can not only reduce explicit costs but also opportunity cost of time
lost to traveling and waiting (a survey result that emphasizes the importance of this last advantage is that 15
percent of unbanked adults cited the distance to financial institution as the main reason for their exclusion). The
success of mobile financial services (MFS) rests on the vast pool of agents (often small retailers) who connect
clients in remote areas to urban centers, allowing them to make transactions. Three out of four adults in Zambia
have a mobile phone which indicates that mobile money has a potential usage of 75 percent. To achieve this
potential, mobile money regulations should encourage inclusiveness, while minimizing fraud and other risks.
Notably, regulations should allow agents outside of bank branches to handle financial transactions and should
make provision for risk-based anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer requirements.

Given the very low usage of MFIs, national saving and credit institutions and other non-bank credit
institutions, there is a strong need to encourage their development in order to enhance access to formal
credit instruments. Compared to its African peers, Zambia is lagging in terms of the use of formal credit
instruments: 82 percent of Zambian adults use exclusively informal credit instruments while MFI usage is only

4 percent. The government of Zambia should encourage the strengthening and development of MFIs in the
provision of appropriate formal credit instruments which are tailor-made to customers’ needs.

Develop insurance services further, including life, property and liability insurance, and specific
insurance for rural areas. Insurance is a useful instrument for managing expenses related to unexpected
events such as medical emergencies, a death in the family, theft or natural disasters. The insurance sector in
Zambia accounts for about 1.4 percent of GDP. 6 With only 5 percent of the adult population using insurance
products, there is potential for much greater take-up. In recognition of the importance of this market, the
Pensions and Insurance Authority has led several reforms or initiatives (including developing a legal framework
for micro-insurance, strategic planning for the industry, identification of insurance key areas to be improved and
awareness campaigns). However, there is still much work to be done to encourage competition among
insurance companies as well as on product innovation and improvement with a view to enhancing service quality
and reducing costs. It is particularly important to develop customer centric insurance services and products
which are geared towards the needs of people living in rural areas with low and irregular incomes. For example,
micro-insurance products could help to meet these needs. Given the lack of granular data on customer and
market needs, providers need to invest in the capacity to source customer understanding systematically through
market research and mining data available within the institution or within its partners. Collecting data and
information is, however, not sufficient. Specific staff and units should be responsible for deriving insights from
the data to customize the value proposition for specific market segments.

Financial Capability and Its Relationship with Financial
Inclusion
    Knowledge of basic financial concepts is a challenge in Zambia, which is exemplified by the
    fact that, on average, respondents were able to correctly answer only 3.7 out of 7 questions
    on the financial literacy quiz.7 Adults in Zambia can perform simple numerical calculations, yet most
    of them struggle to solve more complex financial numeracy tasks and to identify better bargains.
    Adults from the lowest income quartile and from rural areas were the worst performers on the quiz.
    Respondents are, on average, familiar with financial products offered by 4.1 different types of
    providers. Almost all respondents were found to be aware of banks and saving/credit institutions and
    a high proportion knew about MTOs and e-money agents. Insurance products are known about by 18
    percent of adults, unit trusts and MFIs are both known about by 15 percent. and 9 percent are familiar
    with products offered by brokerage houses. Only 0.8 percent of respondents knew of fewer than 2
    types of financial products providers and 1.5 percent were familiar with more than 6.
    Financial capability scores from 15 different countries show that Zambia compares favorably
    in terms of living within one’s means (the best score from the 15 countries) and planning for
    the unexpected. However, it fares poorly for choosing financial products, controlled budgeting and
    planning for old age.
    Urban adults had higher financial capability scores than their rural counterparts except for
    controlled budgeting. The same is true when comparing the richest and poorest segments of the
    population.
    Adults who saved as children outscored others in almost every financial capability topic,
    especially in planning for the unexpected, but also in saving capacity, planning for old age
    and in living within one’s means. Adults who did not save as children got slightly higher scores on
    topics of self-discipline, choosing financial products and controlled budgeting. Adults who saved when
    they were children are more likely to avoid over-borrowing.
    Zambians with low financial literacy8 tend to be less financially included and to utilize more
    informal products than those with higher levels of financial literacy. The analysis of the
    relationship between financial inclusion and financial capability reveals that there is a strong
    correlation between financial inclusion and financial knowledge (financial literacy level and product
    awareness). Moreover, there is also a strong correlation between product awareness and the extent
    to which people use formal financial products. There are no substantial differences in the financial
    behaviors and attitudes of Zambian respondents between financially included and excluded.



Recommendations
The National Strategy on Financial Education (NSFE) for Zambia continues to provide a firm
foundation to strengthen the financial capability of the population, though it needs to be updated. The
NSFE, which was published in 2012, considered the following: information and views expressed during
stakeholder workshops held in October 2010 and November 2011, an analysis of the FinScope Zambia 2009
survey findings9 and a stock-take study.10 Much of the NSFE remains relevant and it is important to build on
this Strategy, rather than to start afresh in order to avoid wasteful duplication of effort and unnecessary delay.

  To assess adults’ financial knowledge and their basic numeric skills, the Zambian financial literacy quiz covered basic computation and
financial concepts such as interest rates, inflation, compound interest, risk diversification, and the main purpose of insurance products.
8
  Low financial literacy level: adults who correctly answered 1 or 2 questions of the financial literacy quiz or those who incorrectly
answered all questions. Medium financial literacy level: 3 to 4 correct answers. High financial literacy level: 5 to 7 correct answers.

However, given the passage of time since the Strategy was published, the action plan will need to be reviewed
and updated. The action plan should outline a set of priority programs to enhance the financial capability of
the overall population and specific subgroups such a rural dwellers, low-income segments, and youth. These
priorities should consider a range of criteria, including needs, likely reach and impact, as well as costs and
availability of resources. As part of the review and updating of the action plan, discussions should be held
with stakeholders (identified in the action plan) to establish whether they remain willing and able to undertake
the specified actions and whether any other modifications should be made; and timelines will need to be
revised. Consideration should also be given to whether changes should be made to the content of the action
plan to account for the findings of the 2016 Zambia Financial Capability Survey.
The National Strategy on Financial Education can provide a good fit with the Zambia’s National
Financial Inclusion Strategy 2017-2022. Based on an analysis of 17 publicly available NFISs, a recent
WBG publication 11 concluded that 15 countries included a dedicated financial capability section in their
broader NFIS. Experience has shown that in countries which have developed and begun to implement a
national financial capability strategy this can help to promote co-operation between relevant stakeholders,
avoid duplication of resources, and minimize gaps and overlaps.
Develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework to measure progress in implementing the
NSFE. As envisaged in the NSFE, the framework should provide guidance to stakeholders on how to test
programs before they are rolled out, how to monitor and evaluate programs which are being implemented,
how to report the results and should explain how the results will be disseminated to stakeholders generally.
Design and use a broad range of programs, including mass media channels, text messages, mobile
phone applications, etc., to enhance financial knowledge and change attitudes and financial
behaviors. People who use different types of media on a regular basis are substantially more likely than less
active media consumers to demonstrate more familiarity with financial products and to get higher financial
capabilities score. Research12 shows that conveying financial messages through new and traditional media
can be effective not only in improving knowledge but also in altering behavior. Edutainment programs are
more effective if messages are delivered in an engaging and entertaining manner through appealing stories
that are memorable, and if they are repeated and reinforced over time. The survey results indicate that, in
Zambia, mobile phones, radio and TV are the most used type of media, which suggests that these channels
can be used to reach large numbers of individuals and households. For example, a mobile phone application
could be developed to facilitate budget planning.
To enable financially included Zambian to benefit from the products they use, financial knowledge
and capability-enhancing programs could be provided in parallel with financial products, which most
people can access. For example, people could be offered financial education when they open a bank
account, take out a loan or take out an insurance policy. Research13 shows that financial education works
best when delivered to adults during teachable moments, when they are more likely to be receptive to new
information. These educational programs should not only help to close gaps in customers’ understanding of
financial concepts but also inform them about (for example) the need to build up a savings cushion for
unexpected financial shocks and old age expenses, how best to budget and to avoid overspending and how
to choose financial products. Educational materials should be informative, clear, impartial, and free of
marketing.

Financial capability content should be fully embedded into primary, secondary, vocational, and
tertiary school curriculum. If people form sound habits on how to manage their money from a young age,
they are more likely to adhere to these throughout their lives. The survey shows that adults who saved as
children outperformed others in almost every financial capability topic and are more likely to avoid over-
borrowing. High quality resources will need to be developed and teachers will need to be well-trained on how
to provide effective financial education. There are several websites containing links to teaching resources. 14
It is more realistic to integrate financial education into one or two existing subjects, such as mathematics,
economics or social studies, rather than to seek to add a new subject into the curriculum. 15
Among the prerequisites for the successful implementation of the National Strategy on Financial
Education are a well-publicized commitment from the Governor of the Bank of Zambia to lead this
work; and dedicated staff, with relevant skills and experience, within BoZ to drive forward the work.
International experience strongly suggests that a national strategy on financial education will not be
successfully implemented in the absence of an effective lead organization. This in turn requires both staff of
the lead organization and other stakeholders to be clear that the most senior officer of the lead organization
– in the case of Zambia, this is the Governor of the Bank of Zambia – takes a close personal interest in
securing the effective implementation of the strategy. It is also essential that dedicated staff within the lead
organization are identified and given a mandate to co-ordinate and drive forward work in implementing the
strategy and to provide support to other stakeholders – for example, by developing simple, clear and
persuasive communication; and by providing a source of expertise on the testing, monitoring and evaluation
of financial capability programs. This staff can include secondees from other organizations, but they should
all come under the direction of BoZ management.
National Financial Inclusion Working Group 6, on Financial Consumer Protection and Financial
Capability, should subsume the role of the Financial Education Steering Committee, which was
described in paragraph 135 of the National Strategy on Financial Education for Zambia. Technical
groups, reporting to the Working Group, should be appointed as and when required to guide work on
key financial capability initiatives. Chapter 4 of Zambia's National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2017-2022
sets out the co-ordination structure for the implementation of this Strategy. This structure includes the
establishment of six working groups, including one dedicated to financial consumer protection and financial
capability. The appointment of a separate Steering Committee to oversee the implementation of the National
Strategy on Financial Education would create an unnecessary additional layer and would be a recipe for
confusion: instead, National Financial Inclusion Working Group 6 should subsume the role which the National
Strategy on Financial Education had envisaged for a Steering Committee.

purchase. The Citigroup Financial Education Curriculum contains interactive lessons, facilitator tips and printable lesson plans (which
are available in several languages) for use from kindergarten level upwards.

Financial Consumer Protection
  In general, users of financial services have expressed satisfaction with the services offered
  by financial services providers, especially MTOs and insurance companies. Consumers are less
  satisfied with banks, national savings and credit institutions: the satisfaction level is nevertheless 79
  percent, though less than this for people who live in rural areas and for younger adults.
  Around 13 percent of adults had a problem with a financial services provider but only 25
  percent of them tried to solve it. Men were more likely than women, and younger adults were more
  likely than older adults, to have a problem.
  The most frequent action taken by adults who tried to resolve a problem was to stop using the
  service before the contract ended. Other measures included submitting a complaint to the provider
  or a claim to a government authority.
  The main cause for inertia by adults who did not try to resolve a problem with financial services
  providers is the lack of awareness of the proper government institution to contact. Other
  believed that financial institutions are too powerful or that government authorities or the law do not
  work properly.
  Adults who did not take any action to settle a dispute with a financial services provider were
  disproportionately male, younger adults, from a rural area, from the highest income quartile,
  with primary education only, and either informally employed or self-employed.


Recommendations
Internal complaints handling requirements should be issued for financial institutions to ensure
adequate and fair mechanisms are in place for providers to handle complaints, and the procedures
should be well publicized. Survey results shows than Zambian adults avoid using complaint procedures
because they are not familiar with the complaint system or they prefer to abandon the financial product rather
than go through the complaint process. In line with the WBG’s Good Practices for Financial Consumer
Protection, legal or regulatory provisions should require financial institutions to provide customers with
information on their complaint handling procedures (including contact information and time limits). This
information should not only be disclosed in products’ terms and conditions, but should also be prominently
posted in branches and online. In addition, customers should be informed about formal redress systems or
legal remedies.
Create a dedicated section about regulations that ensure/address responsible lending practices,
cooling off periods, collection practices, sales practices, and treatment of dormant accounts on the
website of main regulatory institutions. In addition to the introduction of minimum complaints handling
requirements, it is recommended that the BoZ, the SEC, and the PIA expand the contents of their websites
to include detailed information on consumers’ rights and complaint handling procedures for each type of entity
under their supervision.
Deploy an adequate range of supervisory tools to promote sound business practices and ensure
compliance of FIs with consumer protection requirements, including but not limited to issuing Key
Facts Statements (KFS), other disclosure requirements for core retail financial products, and
complaints handling mechanisms. Market monitoring, offsite and onsite inspections, mystery shopping,
and research can be useful tools in the overall market conduct supervisory toolbox to assess the compliance
of financial institutions with regulatory requirements. To optimize the use of scarce resources, financial
consumer protection supervision should be risk-based, with prioritization of riskier consumer issues and
institutions.
Decide whether to establish an independent alternative dispute resolution mechanism, such as a
financial ombudsman. A financial ombudsman is a third party who deals independently with complaints from

                                                       10
consumers that the financial services provider has not been able to resolve to the satisfaction of the
consumer. An ombudsman service is more accessible and cheaper than the courts and reduces the burden
on the courts. A financial ombudsman is well-positioned to analyze trends in financial consumer complaints
and propose ways of securing improved practices by financial institutions. The principles underpinning
financial ombudsmen have been summarized by the WBG16, and include: independence; fairness; clarity of
scope and powers; effectiveness and efficiency; accessibility; transparency; and accountability.17 To identify
the most effective institutional set-up, further analysis may be needed. The financial ombudsman scheme
could be fully or partly paid for by the government (out of taxation) or it could be paid for by charging the cost
to the financial industry. Because of the many other pressures on public finances, it is more common for the
cost of such a scheme to be borne by the industry from which the ombudsman's work arises – though perhaps
with some upfront contribution from public funds to help in establishing it.
The harmonization of financial consumer protection provisions would be a key starting point to
ensure that financial service providers have some common framework as it relates to servicing of
customers. The reason being that currently, financial consumers are subjected to different recourse
mechanisms depending on which financial regulator they are interacting with, largely because of the divergent
protection provisions in the different pieces of legislation.

Background on Zambia Survey
The financial capability questionnaire used for this survey has been extensively tested in the context
of middle- and low-income countries. The survey instrument used is based on a questionnaire developed
with support by the Russia Financial Literacy and Education Trust Fund and is tailored to measure financial
capability in low- and middle-income countries, although it can also be used in high-income countries.
Extensive qualitative research techniques were used to develop this survey instrument, including about 70
focus groups and more than 200 cognitive interviews in eight countries. These research techniques were
used to identify the concepts that are relevant in middle- and low- income settings, and to test and adapt the
questions to ensure that they are well understood and meaningful across income and education levels. The
instrument is currently used or planned to be used in 14 countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and
East Asia and the Pacific.
The survey instrument used allows financial capability, financial inclusion, and consumer protection
issues to be assessed and measured. Financial capability is measured by knowledge of financial concepts
and products, and by attitudes, skills and behavior related to day-to-day money management, planning for
the future, choosing financial products and staying informed. In order to jointly analyze financial capability
and inclusion, the survey instrument captures information on the usage of different kinds of financial products
and providers. The financial consumer protection section gathers information on the incidence of conflicts
with financial services providers and levels of satisfaction with financial products offered by different financial
institutions. The survey instrument has been further customized to the Zambian context, through the addition
of specific questions like those, for example, relating to knowledge about Zambian financial regulatory
institutions.
The Zambian survey is representative of the financially active population and is comprised of a total
sample of 2,505 adults.18 To fulfill the requirements of a scientifically sound survey which allows inferences
to the whole universe of financially active adults in Zambia, probability sampling techniques were used to
select a sample of 2,505 adults. As such, the results of the World Bank report entitled Mapping Subnational
Poverty in Zambia in 2015, 19 that uses results from Zambia’s Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS)
2010, as well as the 2010 Census of Population and Housing were used as a sampling frame. The population
was divided into 8 strata: wards were characterized as rural or urban. Then, they were distributed into four
poverty levels (low, medium low, medium high and high), using poverty headcounts for each ward taken from
the report on Mapping Subnational Poverty in Zambia.
The sample of individual respondents within households was selected through three-stage cluster
sampling. The wards were randomly selected as primary sampling units (PSUs) with probability proportional
to size (PPS) (number of households) at the first stage, and consisted in selecting 167 primary sampling units
to reach the sample target. In each selected PSU, 15 households were randomly drawn and targeted for
surveying at the second stage. This choice of having 15 randomly drawn respondents instead of 20 per EA
reduced the possible clustering effect even further. Finally, within each selected household, eligible adults
either responsible for personal or household finances were randomly drawn by means of the Kish grid.
Individual weights were calculated and used in the ensuing analysis to adjust for varying probabilities of

Between February and September 2016, a Canadian survey firm implemented the survey using
computer-assisted personal interview methods (CAPI). Étude Économique Conseil (EEC Canada), a
Montreal based consulting firm, was hired to conduct the Financial Capability Survey in Zambia. To ensure
highest data quality and avoid common errors associated with paper-and-pencil surveys, an electronic version
of the questionnaire including internal consistency tests were programmed and the survey was administered

refusal conversion strategies, communication with respondents to inform them of the coming survey as well
as explaining the surveys’ objectives, up to 5 contact attempts at different moments during the period of the
survey, etc.) the total non-response rate was around 3.31% percent of the total sampled households.
The adult population for which the results of this survey are meant to be extrapolated has the
following key characteristics: 41 percent of the population lives in urban areas, while the remaining 59
percent live in rural settings (see Figure 49). Slightly less than half of the population is female (48 percent,
see Figure 51). Ranking all individuals by their reported household income and dividing them into four groups,
28 percent of the population fall in the lowest income segment (up to 2,000 ZMW per month), 24 percent in
the second lowest quartile (between 2,001 ZMW and 7,000 ZMW), 23 percent in the second highest (between
7,001 ZMW and 20,300 ZMW), and 25 percent in the highest income quartile (more than 20,300 ZMW, see
Figure 56). Fifty-two percent of the population is younger than 35, 35 percent is between 35 and 55, and 13
percent of the population is older than 55 (see Figure 52). In terms of the education attained, less than 1
percent of the population has some or completed tertiary education including university or other higher
education, 7 percent has some or completed senior secondary schooling, 75 percent has some or completed
junior secondary schooling, while around 9 percent of the population has no schooling at all (see Figure 54).
Irregular and uncertain income flows characterize 49 percent of the population, while the remaining 51 percent
is characterized as earning a stable income (see Figure 55). The average number of adults per household is
three, whereas an average sized household is comprised of six people. As shown in Figure 53 of the
Appendix, 28 percent of the respondents live in households with one to three members, 44 percent in
households comprised of four to six members, and 28 percent live in households with 7 or more members.
The profile of Financial Capability Survey matches with key characteristics of Zambia’s general
census. As Table 1 presents, there are minor differences between Zambia population distribution and the
surveyed population.

     1 Financial Inclusion
     1.1 Introduction
Increasing the access, usage and quality of financial products and services has become a priority in
Zambia. Over the past years, Zambian authorities have made considerable efforts to develop strategies to
improve the operational and legal environment of the financial sector. In particular, the Zambian government
formulated and implemented the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) that focused during its first
phase (2004 – 2009) on (i) “the establishment of an institutional framework to develop the FSDP and a
regulatory framework for a credit reference bureau, (ii) the revision of the financial sector legislation (revision
of Banking and Financial Services act, draft of the legislation about non-banking institutions, rural finance,
house finance and development finance, and harmonization of law governing financial institutions), (iii) the
identification and resolution of weakness in the insolvent state-owned institutions and (iv) the measurement
and analysis of financial services evolution (demand and supply side)”.20 The Zambian government ratified
its commitment to financial inclusion with an extension of FSDP known as phase II (2010 – 2015). The
priorities of this second phase were to (i) “enhance market infrastructure, (ii) increase competition in the
financial sector and (iii) increase access to finance”. 21 As part of authorities and stakeholders’ commitment,
Zambia also became a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI). It signed the Maya Declaration
in 2011. The country aimed to increase its financial inclusion level from 37.3 percent (2009) to 50 percent or
more, provide affordable and convenient financial services in all districts and develop a system to evaluate
the progress and achievements of financial inclusion strategies. 22 The consolidation of all these policies has
brought positive results (as exposed in section 1.2). However, Zambian authorities recognize that a majority
of Zambians are not financially included. They are preparing a reviewed National Financial Inclusion Strategy
(2017 – 2022) whose main objective is “universal access and usage of a broad range of quality and affordable
financial services”.23
The information provided in this chapter will enable to fully understand the state of financial inclusion
in Zambia and provide valuable input for interpreting the findings on financial capability. Collecting
survey data from individuals – that is, from the demand side – can provide valuable insight into the usage,
value and limitations of existing financial services. Demand-side survey data also facilitates analysis of how
patterns of financial inclusion may vary across different population segments, and the degree to which
different financial behaviors – such as saving, borrowing, and making payments – overlap. The data and
analysis presented below can be used to expand financial inclusion in Zambia by identifying population
segments, setting national financial inclusion targets, and designing reforms and projects. Finally, the data
can provide a baseline survey that can be used to measure the progress of reforms and initiatives.

      1.2 Headline Measures for Financial Inclusion
About 40 percent of the surveyed adults in Zambia own an account at a formal financial institution.
Compared to other lower-middle income countries, Zambia has some catching up to do on the banking
industry’s supply side. As shown in Table 2, Zambia fares less favorably on average in terms of financial
inclusion,24 commercial bank branches’ accessibility and domestic credit provided by the financial sector.
Even when compared to its African peers, Zambia is lagging behind in terms of domestic credit. It should be
noted that the progression shown in financial inclusion from 35.6 percent in 2014 to 40.2 percent in 2016 may
be somewhat overstated since the Survey captures people aged 18 and above, whereas Findex includes
adolescents (15-17 years old) who are typically less financially included. When investments, private pensions,
and insurance are included as formal financial products, the Survey finds that 46.8 percent of Zambian adults
use some formal financial product.

Financial inclusion in Zambia has nearly doubled in the last ten years. Figure 1 shows the evolution of
financial inclusion between 2005 and 2016. During this period, formal financial inclusion has risen steadily
from 21.3 percent in 2005 to 40.2 percent in 2016. Percentage of individuals using banks has also increased
from 14.6 to 35.6 percent. However, there was a drop from 31.3 percent in 2014 to 24.8 percent in 2015,
suggesting that people may have migrated away from financial institutions and switched to informal methods.
Users of e-money services were accounted for starting only in 2014 at 12.1 percent and rose to 14.7 percent
in 2016.

   Formal account ownership (“financially included”) is defined in the Zambian financial capability study as the percentage of respondents
who reported having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution (formal
credit, mortgage, credit from microfinance organizations or from the decentralized financial system, debit or credit card, formal savings,
current or savings accounts), or having personally used a mobile money service in the past 12 months.

percentage in 2014 includes bank and MFI usage. 2016 Zambian financial inclusion index can’t be directly compared to Finscope
headline indicator (59.3% (2015), 37.3% (2009) and 33.7% (2005)). In fact, while this last measure includes the usage level of informal
and formal financial products, FCCP index only aggregates formal financial usage. The comparison presented above only highlights
formal evolution because of this situation.

Across the main socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, income level was found to have
the most significant impact on financial inclusion, followed by whether or not adults were located in
rural areas and were from the female group. In fact, Figure 2 shows that only 29.4 percent of the first
income quartile are financially included compared to 52.5 percent for the fourth income quartile, which
represents a 23.1 percent increase between these two categories. Moreover, 35.5 percent of rural inhabitants
are financially included as opposed to 46.1 percent for urban dwellers, corresponding to a 10.6 percent
difference between sectors. Finally, 37.2 percent of women were found to be financially included compared
to 43.1 percent for men, representing a difference of 6 percent. These differences remain statistically
significant even after controlling for income, education, and a range of other individual characteristic (see
Table 9). 25

There is a strong negative correlation between financial inclusion and regional poverty. Copperbelt
and Lusaka are the most financially included provinces whereas Eastern and Western are the least.
As Table 3 summarizes and, Map 1 and Map 2 detail, provinces at the top of the range (Copperbelt and
Lusaka) have a financial inclusion rate averaging 48.5 percent, which is about 19 percent more than the
average for the provinces of Eastern and Western, sitting at the bottom of this range.

There seems to be a correlation between financial inclusion and the size of household or stability of
income. Figure 3 shows that financial inclusion increases from 35.5 to 40.8 and 42.1 percent for households
of 1 to 3, 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 members, respectively. Furthermore, financial inclusion averages 38.7 percent for
people with an unstable income as opposed to 41.6 percent for those with a stable income.

     1.3 Financial Product Usage
The following sections dig deeper into the types of institutions and specific products used by
Zambian adults, both within and outside the formal financial system. The analysis is organized by type
of financial institution. Each section documents overall awareness of a given institution among respondents,
explores patterns of historical usage, i.e. whether a respondent has ever used that institution, and their current
usage.




                                                          19
       1.3.1 Commercial Banks, National Saving and Credit
            Institutions
The banking sector accounts for over 90 percent of financial system assets.26 “The top five bank’s
assets account for about 63.6 percent of total banking sector assets. The banking sector comprises 19
commercial banks, which are made up of two local and 17 foreign owned banks, based on the revised
classification of commercial banks under the new capital adequacy regulations. Out of the 17 foreign banks,
13 are subsidiaries of foreign banks while the remaining four are not affiliated to foreign banking groups. The
foreign banks include subsidiaries of South African banks, UK-based banks and other pan-African banks.”27
There is, however, only one savings and credit institution, the National Savings and Credit Bank.

The strength of Zambia’s banking sector is matched by high awareness of these institutions. Almost
everybody knows about services offered by banks, and its national saving and credit institution. 93
percent of the sampled population have or have used such services in the past, but only 36 percent
currently have an account, which may suggest a low satisfaction among past (but not actual) users.
As the regression analysis suggests (Table 10), and Figure 4 exposes, bank usage exhibited the same pattern
across the main socioeconomic and demographic characteristics as explained in section 1.2 (Headline
Measures for Financial Inclusion). The biggest disparity exists between adults in the fourth quartile who
currently have 17 percent more accounts than those in the first quartile. The next level of inequity resides
with urban dwellers who presently have more accounts, in the order of 6 percent, than their rural counterparts.
Finally, in terms of gender, 3 percent more men than women currently have such account.

After bank accounts, loans, followed by mortgage and then credit cards, are the other banking
products that Zambian adults currently use. As Appendix A indicates, a mere 4.5 percent of adults report
having formal credit from a bank. Socioeconomic groups with the highest percentage of formal credit are the
wealthy (6.3 percent), the urban population (5.4 percent) and men (4.6 percent). Moreover, only 4.1 percent
of Zambian adults currently have a mortgage. One possible factor that may influence the mortgage index is
the high interest rates in Zambia. The comparison of mortgage rates among 46 African nations reveals that
Zambia is at the top of the list (interest rates higher than 25 percent) after Malawi and Ghana. 28 While
Zambia’s urbanization rate29 (4.1 percent) is not low compared to other low-middle income economies such
as Kenya (4.2 percent), Mauritania (3.4 percent) and Lesotho (3.1 percent), Zambia’s housing affordability
level30 (3.8 percent) is far behind that of other previously mentioned nations. In fact, the most recent index is
29.4 percent for Kenya, 20.3 percent for Lesotho and 5 percent for Mauritania. Finally, credit cards are the
most uncommon banking product. These are used by only 1 percent of the Zambian population.


     1.3.2         Payment Providers
     Money Transfer Operators
Nine out of ten adults know about services offered by MTOs but only about 53 percent use such
services, mainly the rich population living in urban districts. As shown in Figure 5, 90 percent of
respondents know about services offered by MTOs, 76 percent have already used such services in the past
and 53 percent currently utilize these. MTOs are used by 19 percent more urban inhabitants than rural
dwellers, and 19 percent more individuals belonging to the fourth income quartile than those from the first
quartile. There is no difference between men and women. MTO usage is linked to the remittances trend in
Zambia. In fact, Zambia is one of the top 10 remittance senders among Sub-Saharan economies. Such
remittances represent about 0.3 percent of GDP (0.1 US billions).

    E-money Agents

     Electronic money (e-money)-based instruments: In general terms, these instruments involve
     the payer maintaining a pre-funded transaction account with a PSP [Payment Service Provider],
     often a non-banking entity. Specific products include online money when the payment instruction
     is initiated via the internet, and mobile money when initiated via mobile phones and prepaid cards.



Although 76 percent of adults know about e-money services, only 29 percent have used them in the
past and 15 percent utilize these presently, suggesting a possible lack of trust for this type of service;
such services are mostly utilized by rich men living in urban areas. As depicted in Figure 6, 22 percent
more rich adults than poor ones make use of e-money services, 15 percent more urban dwellers rely on such
methods than their rural counterparts, and 6 percent more men than women utilize such instruments.

Compared to other African countries, Zambia has a low cellular penetration rate as well as low usage
of mobile financial services. As shown in Table 3 and Figure 7, Zambia’s mobile penetration rate is 74.5
percent compared to the average rate (90.8 percent), and strikingly low when compared to Ghana (129.7
percent) and Côte d’Ivoire (119.3 percent). Zambia’s e-money usage rate among adults (14.7 percent) is also
lower than the average rate (19.8 percent).

On the other hand, Zambia does not fare well as far as the mobile services’ tax rate is concerned,
which can be an important barrier to increasing digital inclusion.31 As Figure 8 illustrates, Zambia is in
the top 5 Sub-Saharan economies that have the highest mobile consumer tax rate. While mobile phone users
in Kenya and Zimbabwe have to pay consumer taxes representing 21 percent of the total cost of mobile
ownership, Zambian mobile-users pay 26 percent, which is 6 percent above the Sub-Saharan average level
(20 percent).

        1.3.3 Microfinance Institutions
Banks continue to represent the largest portion of the financial sector in terms of assets, MFIs still
play a relatively small role in Zambia and are primarily focused on payday lending. There are 33 MFIs
licensed by the Bank of Zambia as of September 2014, an increase of 29 from four at the time the regulations
were passed in 2006. Regulation divides Zambia’s MFIs into two categories – deposit-taking MFIs
(development MFIs) and non-deposit-taking MFIs (credit companies, or payroll-based MFI). According to a
WBG survey, the microfinance sector in Zambia, as of 2012, recorded K 214 million in assets and a gross
loan portfolio of K 168 million. Development MFIs are required to have a minimum regulatory capital of K 250
million and an additional K 25 millions of payroll-based regulatory capital. 32 Recently, the growth in the MFI
loan book for all enterprise categories fell markedly after the imposition of the cap in 2013; the objective was
to reduce the cost of borrowing, increase access to finance for SMEs and reduce over-indebtedness. In fact,
the volume of loans for medium sized enterprises shrank, while the growth rate for small and micro enterprises
reduced by more than 50 percent. 33

MFI products are known and used by very few people (4 percent). Data from Figure 9 shows that
knowledge and usage of MFI products remains low: 14 percent of the adult population is familiar with them
and only 4 percent currently use these. There are 3 percent more rural than urban dwellers utilizing such
products. Finally, 2 percent more men than women subscribe to such services.

MFIs target a different set of clients than do banks or national saving and credit institutions. People
who use MFI credit the most are poor rural men. With respect to banks (see Figure 10 and Figure 12), the
richest Zambian adults are 4 percent more likely to have a bank loan than an MFI loan. MFI usage is inversely
correlated with income levels: usage is 3 percent more for lower income groups as opposed to higher income
ones. Lower income groups are almost 2 percent more likely to have an MFI loan than a bank loan.

     1.3.4         Insurance Companies
The insurance industry has been steadily growing. There are 27 licensed insurance companies, 18
general insurance and nine life insurance companies as of July 31, 2014. The insurance industry is regulated
by the Pensions Insurance Authority. The Insurance Act, 1997 as amended in 2005, prohibited insurance
companies from conducting both life and non-life insurance business. Significant growth has also been
recorded in volume of business underwritten and as of 31 December 2013, the volume of general insurance
stood at K 1.022 billion and a total of K 330 million was paid out in claims. This is in comparison to GWP of K
96,485 in 2002 and K 27,167 that was paid out in claims. Regarding the long term, the GWP turnover as of
31 December 2014, stood at K 450 million and K 137 million was paid out in claims in comparison to GWP of
K 26,431 and claims amounting to K 9,665 recorded in 2002. 34

There is still room for potential growth of insurance products. Very few Zambians utilize insurance
products especially poor and rural adults. In fact, Figure 12 proves that the knowledge of insurance
products is quite low in Zambia: only 18 percent of adults are familiar with such services. Overall historical
usage of insurance products by the population is 13 percent, however, current usage is only 5 percent. This
underscores the lack of trust in such instruments. Only 1 percent of the poorest Zambians currently use
insurance, a striking difference with the richest category (8 percent). Moreover, only 2 percent of the rural
population is protected by insurance, as opposed to 8 percent for its urban counterpart.

      1.3.5 Brokerage Houses or Unit Trusts
A very small fraction of Zambian adults currently have investments, whether male or female, urban
or rural, rich or poor, which may highlight the lack of knowledge or interest in such products. More
than three quarters of Zambian adults are not aware of brokerage houses or unit trust products and services,
and 13 percent35 have used investments products in the past. Only a mere 0.1 percent currently hold a form
of investment. High income earners seem to know more about such products (29 percent) compared to low
income groups (19 percent). The richest earners currently possess twice as many investment products than
the poorest earners. These results may be associated to the fact that “the main capital market in Zambia, the
Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is not well-developed. Specifically, the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LUSE) has
24 listed companies with a market capitalization of 22 percent of the GDP. The debt market is relatively
underdeveloped and so is the Zambia Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ZAMACE), which was established
in 2007. There is, however, a recent ongoing effort to revitalize the ZAMACE. It currently provides four types
of services: (i) commodity trading; (ii) secured transactions; (iii) setting of grades and standards for maize,
wheat, soya beans and sunflower; and (iv) a certified warehouse receipt system.” 36




35
   This historical rate and its decline over the time have been influenced and explained by two facts. (i) The services and products of
brokerage houses or unit trust aren’t limited to stock market. In fact, it is possible for Zambians adults to make investments outside the
stock market through these firms by way of pension funds, life insurance, private equity, venture capital and certain types of unit trusts,
such as money market fund, bond fund, property fund, gratuity investment fund, education investment fund and microfinance fund. This
means that the historical rate covers a variety of products with different trends and patterns. On the other hand, (ii) Lusaka Stock
Exchange (LuSE) showed the worst performance (-39.8% in terms of USD) across the African nations over the past five years. This
performance was even lower (-51.1%) in the last three years. In terms of local currency, this index was -24.4% in the last year and -
20.4% during the past three years.

        1.3.6 Patterns of Formality and Informality in Savings
             and Credit
Half of adults save money37 and most of them are rich and from urban areas. Furthermore, most
people report using formal products. In fact, Figure 13 shows that, among 50 percent of the adults who
save money, 52 percent use only formal products, 28 percent utilize only informal ones and the balance (20
percent) have a combination of formal and informal savings. Propensity to save is predominantly higher first
among the rich (29% more than the poor in absolute terms) and secondly among people living in urban areas
(19% more than rural in absolute terms). The difference between women and men who save is only 5 percent
in favor of the former.

Figure 13. Formal and Informal Savings




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Zambia 2016.

About two-thirds of adults currently have debts, contracted mostly using only informal instruments
(82 percent) compared to about 8 percent through formal credits only. Furthermore, most of the
informal debt is incurred by the poorest and rural segments of the population. Figure 14 demonstrates
that among the 66 percent of the population who are in debt, less than 8 percent have taken out loans
exclusively from formal providers, more than 82 percent have used only informal credit and the balance (10
percent) holds a combination of formal and informal debt. Informal credit is used more, first, by the lowest
income group (76 percent versus 27 percent for higher income) and second, by rural dwellers (69 percent
versus 33 percent for urban residents). The variance between women and men is less significantly in favor
of the former (56 percent versus 52 percent). Formal credit is used more by higher income groups (9 percent
versus 1 percent for lower income) and urban dwellers (8 percent versus 2 percent for rural residents).

There is a strong formal credit pattern differentiation across provinces in Zambia, with Southern and
Luapula displaying the highest levels and Western and Lusaka the lowest ones. As Map 3 illustrates,
at the top of the range we have Luapala and Southern with formal borrowing averaging 7.8 percent, which is
more than 5 times that of Western and Lusaka (1.5 percent).

    1.4 The Unbanked and Barriers to Owning a Formal
        Account
In Zambia, the approximately 3.8 million financially excluded adults – those who use no formal
financial products or services - are disproportionately female, poor, and living in rural areas. Almost
63 percent of Zambian women do not currently use a formal financial product nor service. Nor do 71 percent
of the poorest quartile of Zambian adults, or 65 percent of adults living in rural areas. Yet, as stated in the
Global Financial Development Report 2014 (World Bank, 2013a), lack of usage of financial products does
not necessarily mean lack of access. While some people may have access to financial services at affordable
prices, and may decide not to use these, others may lack access because of constraints such as excessively
high costs or unavailability of services due to regulatory barriers or other factors. The Financial Capability
Survey asked respondents who do not have a formal account to report the reason.

The main reason given by unbanked adults for not owning a formal account is the lack of enough
money, followed by high account fees. As illustrated in Figure 15, 31 percent of respondents reported the
lack of enough money as the main obstacle to formal account ownership, almost twice as much as those who
mentioned high account fees (17 percent), institutions being too far away (15 percent) and lack of trust (15
percent). More men than women said that the main barriers were lack of enough money and institutions being
too far away, and the inverse (more men than women) was found for high account fees and lack of trust.

       2 Financial Capability
     Financial Capability is the internal capacity to act in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic
     and environmental conditions. It therefore encompasses the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors
     of consumers with regards to managing their resources and understanding, selecting, and making use
     of financial services that fit their needs.


       2.1 Knowledge of Financial Concepts
Financial knowledge and skills are especially important in an environment where financial products
and services are becoming available to people who have little or no experience of using the formal
financial system. While these products and services provide potential benefits, they also give rise to risks
that may be unfamiliar to existing, as well as to new customers. To be able to benefit from these new
opportunities without being exposed to undue risks, a certain level of financial knowledge and skills is
required.
Financial knowledge and skills are a key element in Zambia’s financial inclusion goals. The Zambian
authorities recognize the importance of financial literacy in enabling people to take informed financial
decisions and to take full advantage of financial products and services. As part of FSDP Phase II (see section
1.1), the Zambian authorities formulated the National Strategy on Financial Education for Zambia, whose
main objective is that “people in Zambia have improved knowledge, understanding, skills, motivation and
confidence to help them to secure positive financial outcomes for themselves and their families by 2017.”38
To assess respondents’ financial knowledge and their basic numeracy skills, seven questions were
included in the 2016 Zambia Financial Capability Survey. These covered basic computation and financial
concepts such as interest rates, inflation, compound interest, risk diversification, and the main purpose of
insurance products. The questions were asked because they capture financial concepts and skills that are
considered as being crucial for informed savings and borrowing decisions as well as for being able to manage
risks more effectively and/or to take advantage of investment opportunities. A financial literacy index is
obtained based on the number of correct responses provided by each survey participant to the seven financial
literacy questions. This index ranges from 0 to 7, whereby 0 indicates respondents who incorrectly answered
all the questions, while a score of 7 indicates survey participants who answered all of them correctly. Box 1
details questions from the financial literacy quiz.

     Box 1. Financial Literacy Quiz

 Question 1. Imagine that five brothers are given a gift of K 100,000. If the brothers have to divide the money
 equally, how much does each one get?

 Question 2. Now, imagine that the five brothers have to wait one year to get their part of the K 100,000 and
 inflation stays at 10%. In one year’s time will they be able to buy:

 •   More with their share of money than they could today
 •   The same amount
 •   Less than they could buy today
 •   It depends on the types of things that they want to buy (do not read out this option)

 Question 3. Suppose you put K 1,000,000 into a savings account with a guaranteed interest rate of 2% per year.
 You don’t make any further payments into this account and you don’t withdraw any money. How much would be
 in the account at the end of the first year, based on the interest payment made?

 Question 4. How much would be in the account at the end of five years? Would it be:

 •   More than K 1,100,000 (ZMW)
 •   Exactly K 1,100,000 (ZMW)
 •   Less than K 1,100,000 (ZMW)
 •   It is impossible to tell from the information given

 Question 5. Let’s assume that you saw a TV-set of the same model on sale in two different shops. The initial
 retail price you saw was K 5,000 (ZMW). One shop offered a discount of K 500 (ZMW), while the other one
 offered a 10% discount. Which one is a better bargain, a discount of K 500 (ZMW) or 10%?

 • A discount of K 500
 • They are the same
 • A 10% discount

 Question 6. Which of the following statements best describes the primary purpose of insurance products?

 •   To accumulate savings
 •   To protect against risks
 •   To make payments or send money
 •   Other

 Question 7. Suppose you have money to invest. Is it safer to buy stocks of just one company or to buy stocks of
 many companies?

 • Buy stocks of one company
 • Buy stocks of many companies.

The survey results show that, on average, respondents were able to correctly answer 3.7 out of the 7
financial literacy questions. Figure 16 reveals that very few (0.6 percent) had correct responses to either
none or all of the questions. 53 percent of Zambian adults were able to provide between 3 and 4 correct
answers, with the median being 4 correct answers (30.7 percent). 21 and 8 percent of the respondents were
able to answer 5 and 6 correct questions respectively.

Adults in Zambia are able to perform simple numerical calculations, yet most of them struggle to
solve financial numeracy tasks and identify better bargains. As demonstrated in Figure 17, 91 percent
of adults were able to perform simple divisions. Moreover, about 60 to 65 percent of respondents understood
the concept of inflation and were familiar with the purpose of insurance, but for the concept of risk
diversification, the answers were split more or less evenly between right and wrong answers. 66 percent of
adults were unable to identify better bargains and 72 percent and 54 percent could not perform compound
interest and simple interest calculations, respectively.

Adults from the lowest income quartile and rural areas performed the worst on the quiz. As shown in
Figure 18, 91 percent of respondents who obtained a low score (0 to 2 correct answers) came from rural
areas. Furthermore, 67 percent of adults registering a low score were from the first income quartile compared
to 2 per cent from the fourth quartile. 59 percent of people who had a high score (5 to 7 correct answers) live
in urban areas, and 48 percent of respondents of the same group are from the fourth income quartile
compared to 21 percent from the first quartile.

An international comparison of respondents in 23 countries confirms that Zambians fall below the
international average for interest rate calculations. As shown in Table 5, Zambia fares comparatively
well in terms of understanding inflation and simple division, as the national average is higher than that of all
23 countries. However, the opposite applies to the calculation of both simple and compound interest.

Financial awareness, as reported by the respondents themselves, gave mixed results. Inflation,
shares, collective investment schemes, and dividends have the lowest awareness levels, while
interest and exchange rate have the highest levels. As can be seen in Figure 19, more than 60 percent of
respondents have never heard about inflation, shares, collective investment schemes, and dividends. Less
than 23 percent report that they know the meaning of these terms. 97 and 72 percent of people have heard
about and report knowing the meaning of interest and exchange rates, respectively. 44 percent of adults have
never heard about insurance and 18 percent have heard about it but do not know the meaning.

There is a strong discrepancy between self-reported financial knowledge (literacy) and actual
proficiency as measured by the quiz, especially for inflation and interest. As shown in Figure 19, 52
percent of the respondents claimed to have understood the meaning of interest rates yet gave wrong answers
in the quiz on this topic. Furthermore, 50 percent of the adults who said they did not know the meaning of
inflation, answered correctly in the quiz on this concept.

     Box 2. Debt Level and Financial Knowledge

Survey results further suggest that adults with high levels of debt lack specific financial knowledge. The
average financial literacy score of Zambian adults with a debt higher than their yearly income is lower than adults
with a low level of indebtedness (less than one month of income) or those who do not have any debt at all, a difference
that remains statistically significant even after controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors. As
Figure 21 shows, Zambian adults with relatively high indebtedness are much less likely to have a basic understanding
of simple and compound interest rates. Specifically, the proportion of correct answers about simple interest is
between 6 and 11 percent lower for indebted adults. This difference is between 5 and 7 percent with regards to
compound interest. This knowledge gap makes high indebted populations more vulnerable to economic shocks, such
as interest rate increases or inflation periods, and ultimately adversely affects their ability to repay their outstanding
debts.
17 percent of Zambian adults have borrowed up to their limit or above what they can really afford. While nine
percent of Zambian adults are obliged to repay money and are unable to borrow more, eight percent of the population
has already borrowed more than they can really afford. Sixty percent of respondents have a debt between two and
twelve months of income and 37 percent of them have a debt higher than their yearly income. Specifically, adults
living in rural areas who did not save when they were children are significantly more susceptible to borrow up to their
limit or above it (see Figure 21).

    2.2 Knowledge of Financial Products
In order to assess respondents’ level of awareness of financial products, the financial capability
survey asked about their familiarity with financial products offered by different types of formal and
informal providers. In particular, survey participants were asked if they were familiar with products offered
by banks, national saving and credit institutions, micro finance institutions (MFIs), insurance companies,
money changers, money transfer operators (MTOs), brokerage houses, unit trusts and e-money agents. A
financial products awareness index was constructed based on the number of financial products known to
survey participants. This index ranges from 0 to 9, where 0 indicates respondents who are not familiar with
any of these products and 9 represents familiarity with all of them.
Respondents are, on average, familiar with financial products offered 4.1 different types of providers.
Almost all respondents are aware of banks and saving/credit institutions and a high proportion know
about MTOs and e-money agents. As can be seen in Figure 22 and Figure 23, only 0.8 percent of
respondents know fewer than 2 types of financial products providers and 1.5 percent were familiar with more
than 6. The median of the distribution was found to be 4 providers (35.1 percent). Moreover, respondents
were mainly familiar with banks, national savings and credit institutions (99 percent), money transfer services
(90 percent), e-money agents (76 percent) and money changers (64 percent).

Those who know the most numbers of providers predominantly come from urban areas and are
members of the highest income quartile. As Figure 24 shows, adults from the fourth income quartile,
compared with the first, know more about insurance companies (29 vs. 8 percent), money changers (75 vs.
54 percent) and e-money agents (88 vs. 63 percent). For MTOs, that difference is 7 percentage points. The
difference in awareness of insurance companies, money changers, and e-money agents between urban and
rural households is around 17 percentage points. These differences remain highly significant as regression
analysis shows (see Table 17).

Better financial knowledge of products and services is correlated with regular consumption of
different types of media. As regression analysis in Table 17 shows and Figure 23 illustrates, Zambian adults
who try to stay informed by using different types of media tend to be more familiar with financial products than
adults who do not use media. Banks and MTO services are the exception to this tendency because the
knowledge is similar among users and non-media users. To understand media usage of Zambian adults, Box
3 presents a consumption overview.

     Box 3. Media Consumption Overview


Three out of four adults in Zambia have a mobile phone and less than one out of four uses the Internet
or reads the newspaper, 39 percent own a TV, and 60 percent listen to the radio. As shown in Figure 26,
media penetration was found to be higher among men, urban dwellers, and the rich. The difference between high
income earners and their low-income counterparts regarding mobile phone and Internet usage were reported to
be 12 and 11 percent respectively. Between adults living in rural and urban areas, such variances were found to
be 12 and 16 percent respectively.

     2.3 Financial Behavior and Attitudes
Even if people possess knowledge of basic financial concepts and products they may struggle to
translate this knowledge into action. To identify the role that attitudes play in shaping individuals' financial
decisions and to see whether, and if so how, attitudes translate into financial behavior, the survey asks
questions about different aspects (components) of financial capability that include attitudes, motivations, and
behaviors. This chapter gives an overview of strengths and areas for improvements shown by surveyed
Zambians regarding relevant financial behavior and attitudes.
In the Zambia data set, 8 main components of financial capability can be identified, some of which
refer to behavior and others to attitudes or motivations. The Financial Capability and Inclusion Survey in
Zambia recorded different financial attitudes, motivations, and behavior through diverse qualitative questions
with various measurement levels (nominal and ordinal). To identify the main components of financial
capability in Zambia, a statistical procedure was applied to simultaneously quantify categorical variables while
reducing the variance of the data. This procedure known as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) reduces
the original set of variables to a smaller uncorrelated set of variables (principal components) which aim to
account for as much of the variance in the data as possible. The PCA method39 provides a single indicator
(or score) for each component. The scores range between 0 (lowest score) and 100 (highest score). Table 6
presents the relevant attitudes that define each component.

   The PCA analysis performed in Zambia has focused on 8 main components (or dimensions) that account for 65 percent of the total
variance. Other dimensions were ignored because of their lower contribution to total variance. Principal components having eigenvalues
greater than one were also prioritized.

Compared to other aspects of financial capability, survey participants show strengths in areas related
to living within one’s means and planning for the unexpected. The biggest weakness was found to be
saving capacity. Figure 27 shows that the highest level of strength is “living within one’s means” with a score
of 87 percent. The second highest score was found to be “planning for the unexpected” at 67 percent.

The weakest link in the chain is in terms of “saving capacity” (24 percent), a component that is key
for governments that would like to extend the coverage of contributory social protection policies. This
low score captures the fact that only about a fourth of respondents have money left after paying for food and
essential items.

Multivariate analysis allows examination of characteristics that are associated with the capacity to
save after controlling for numerous individual and contextual factors. Figure 28 shows the correlates of
reporting the fact of having a capacity to put money aside. Having a stable income is more important than
having a high income. Informal and self-employed workers are less likely to be able to put money aside,
compared to formally salaried individuals. Having high financial literacy (specifically, correctly answering the
hardest questions, such as the ones on investment diversification) is also associated with having higher
saving capacity. Another characteristic of potential savers is that they are more likely to use a mobile phone.
Fewer potential savers reside in poor, rural areas that are far from schools or banks.

Other behavioral attributes scored between 42 and 51 percent, slightly below average with controlled
budgeting on the top of this range and responsibility at the lower end. The survey went into greater
depth by analyzing all topics associated with each component or dimension. Box 4 and Box 5 present the
findings for each component.

   The marginal correlations are obtained from a linear regression model of a dummy variable for having money left after spending on
essentials on age, schooling, gender, marital status, income, employment, financial literacy score, and characteristics of the place of
residence.


                                                                   45
    Box 4. Topics Associated with each Component or Dimension (I)
Living within one’s means. A majority of Zambians do not run short of money nor do they borrow money to
purchase essential items. When people run out of money, it is because they overspend. The survey results show
that 72 percent of adults do not as a habit deplete their funds, but when they do, it is because they overspend (19
percent). Finally, 92 percent of Zambians do not borrow money to buy food or other essential items.

The result previously exposed that 72 percent of Zambian adults have enough money to meet their food and other
essential needs is consistent with the fact that the majority of the Zambian population (93 percent) eats at least two
meals per day. In particular, 52 percent eats 3 meals, 41 percent 2 meals and only 3.7 percent one meal (Central
Statistical Office, 2015). It is also in line with 2015 Finscope results that found for a similar question that 74.3 percent
of adults, do not continuously struggle to keep up with regular expenses. On the other hand, the 2016 FCCP survey
indicates that less than 30 percent of Zambian adults don’t have enough money to meet their food and other essential
needs, illustrating that a lot has to be done to address the needs of the bottom of the pyramid in Zambia. This result
is also consistent with the observations of the 2015 Finscope survey, that indicated that 25.7 percent of adults
continuous struggle to keep up with regular expenses.

Planning for unexpected expenses. Most adults were able to do something to meet unexpected expenses,
but those who could not cover them in full were very concerned. 25 percent of Zambians could cover
unexpected major expenses in full without borrowing money. 57 percent of adults would not be able to cover
unexpected expenses tomorrow in full but had implemented strategies to do so without borrowing money. 77 percent
of the sampled population who could not meet unexpected expenses in full worried greatly about this situation.

Controlled budgeting. Although most respondents plan how the money will be used, the sample was evenly
distributed between those who do and those who do not stick to a budget. According to the survey results, 69
percent of adults plan the way in which their money will be used (51 percent always plan, 18 percent sometimes
plan). Moreover, about half of Zambians adhere to their planned budget (36 percent always and 13 percent
sometimes). 21 percent of respondents never maintain a budget.

Planning for old age expenses. Zambians are evenly split between those who do and those who do not have
a strategy in place for covering old age expenses. Most adults with a strategy do not have full coverage.
49 percent of adults have strategies for covering old age expenses, and, among those who do, 73 percent do not
yet have full coverage. 65 percent of respondents without a strategy mentioned that they are worried about having
no provisions for old age (45 percent very worried and 20 percent a bit worried). Finally, only 6.3 percent of adults
currently have private pension products (personally or jointly).

Self-discipline. About half of Zambians regularly buy unessential items, 62 percent lack purchasing
discipline, and 52 percent claim they live only in the present. The survey results show that 63 percent of adults
buy unessential items (47 percent regularly and 16 percent sometimes). Furthermore, 62 percent of respondents do
not consider themselves disciplined. 52 percent of Zambians consider they live more on a daily basis, and do not
plan for tomorrow.

Choosing financial products. The majority of Zambians neither consider alternatives nor check the detailed
terms and conditions before obtaining a financial product. The survey results demonstrate that 77 percent of
respondents do not consider many alternatives before deciding which product to get or search until they find the
best product for their needs. Such respondents do not check the detailed terms and conditions of the products before
purchasing them.




                                                               46
    Box 5. Topics Associated with each Component or Dimension (II)
Responsibility. Most adults are aware of the amount of money available for daily spending and 75 percent
do not try to save. More detailed findings show that 71 percent of adults report they know how much money they
have available for day-to-day spending (54 percent exactly and 17 percent roughly). However, 75 percent of
respondents say they do not try to save. 51 percent of Zambians consider themselves impulsive.

Saving capacity. Most Zambians do not have money left over after paying for essential items. However,
more than 95 percent of adults who have excess funds either save or spend them on necessities. 74 percent
of Zambians do not have additional money after having paid for essential items, and only 19 percent regularly have
anything left over, and only 7 percent sometimes.




    Financial capability scores of 15 different countries show that Zambia compares favorably in terms
    of living within one’s means (best score) and planning for the unexpected; however, it fares poorly
    for choosing financial products, controlled budgeting and planning for old age. As shown in Table 7,
    Zambia scores 12, 10, and 8 percent less than the average for choosing financial products, controlled
    budgeting and planning for old age expenses, respectively. However, Zambia scores better for living within
    one’s means by 13 percent and planning for unexpected expenses by 3 percent. Furthermore, it should be
    noted that Zambia has the highest score of all 15 countries in terms of living within one’s means.

    In-depth analysis suggests that urban adults obtain higher financial capability scores than their rural
    counterparts, except in the area of controlled budgeting. The same results apply to the richest and
    poorest segments of the population. Figure 29 indicates that respondents from urban areas averaged
    scores between 3 and 15 more points than those from rural sections in all topics except controlled budgeting.
    Moreover, respondents from the fourth income quartile averaged scores between 5 and 18 points higher than
    those from the first quartile in all topics except controlled budgeting.

Adults with low financial literacy have worse financial capability scores than all others except in the
area of controlled budgeting, as presented in Figure 30. Box 6 examines how Zambians with low financial
capability might fail to accurately evaluate their future sources of support.41




41
    A priori, the patterns documented in Box 6 could also reflect permanent differences between younger and older cohorts. However, in
this case, the discrepancy in expected vs. actual family support would likely go in the opposite direction. The differences by financial
literacy scores also point towards anticipation/planning errors rather than cohort effects, as well as the fact that age profiles in expected
sources of old age support exhibit breaks in old age instead of smooth trends.


                                                                      48

Adults who are not using any type of media tend to have lower financial capability scores than those
who do, except when it comes to self-discipline and planning for old age expenses, as shown in Figure
31. Respondents who do not use any kind of media averaged scores between 2 and 8 points less than those
of others in all topics except self-discipline and planning for old age.

Adults who saved as children outperformed others in almost every financial capability topic,
especially planning for the unexpected. As can be seen in Figure 32, respondents who saved as children
all scored 100 in planning for the unexpected, which represents an average of 39 points more than the score
of others. Furthermore, respondents who saved as children averaged scores between 4 and 9 points higher
than that of others with respect to saving capacity, planning for old age, living within one’s means and
responsibility. On the remaining topics (self-discipline, choosing financial products, and controlled budgeting),
adults who did not save as children scored between 1 and 5 points higher.

    Box 6. Planning for Old Age and Financial Literacy

Zambians are very limited in their capacity to plan for old age when compared to other countries where this
score is available. 15.7 percent of survey respondents under the age of 60 report they have not thought about how
to meet their expenses in old age and only 25.7 percent expect their income sources to be sufficient.
In addition, Zambians might fail to accurately evaluate their future sources of support, particularly among
individuals with low financial literacy. The survey data can be used to compare the sources of income that working-
age respondents expect to rely on, with the sources of income that old Zambians actually rely on. There are significant
discrepancies between the two: the young appear to overestimate the availability of family support and to
underestimate the degree to which they will have to work past retirement age.
Figure 33. Expected Sources of Economic Support in Old Age




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Zambia 2016.

The discrepancies are much larger for individuals with low financial literacy who are more likely to incorrectly
predict the income sources they will be able to rely on (see Figure 33). For example, 11 percent of young
respondents with low financial literacy expect to have to work in old age, but 30 percent of old respondents actually
do. The proportion of young respondents with low financial literacy who expect to rely on their family members and on
savings are 17.5 percent and 14 percent, respectively. The corresponding numbers for older respondents are only 9
percent and 6 percent. By contrast, individuals with high financial literacy exhibit much smaller discrepancies in
identifying actual and future income sources.

    Box 7. Knowledge about Regulatory Financial Institutions (I)

Zambians were found to be familiar with regulatory financial institutions (except the SEC), but fail to grasp
the full extent of their mandates. As shown in Figure 35, 92 percent of adults are familiar with the BoZ and only 7
percent could define exactly its mandate. BoZ awareness levels vary significantly between provinces. While less
than 4 percent of Zambian adults living in Luapula or Western identifies the BoZ’s mandate, the awareness level
increases by about 8 points for those who live in North Western or Central. On the other hand, as Figure 35 illustrates
(see Box 8), 73 percent of respondents are unfamiliar with the SEC and only 8 percent could accurately identify its
mandate. Finally, familiarity with the PIA is more or less evenly split, but only 12 percent have full knowledge of its
mandate.

        3 Relationship Between Financial Inclusion and
          Financial Capability
   There is little doubt that financial capability and financial inclusion influence each other. While lack of
   knowledge about financial products may hinder their use, it is likely that as people begin using financial
   services, they become more familiarized with and knowledgeable about them through “learning by doing.”
   While disentangling a causal link between financial inclusion and financial capability is beyond the scope of
   this report, this chapter presents an overview of who the financially excluded in Zambia are and how their
   financial knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors compare to financially included segments of the population.


        3.1 Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion
   A lack of financial literacy is usually cited as an explanation for the limited demand for financial
   services in developing countries. If people do not understand financial concepts and lack basic numeracy
   skills, they may not feel comfortable in choosing financial products and hence will not demand them or,
   perhaps of even greater concern, will choose products that do not meet their needs or use them
   inappropriately. For instance, in a study in India and Indonesia, Cole et al. (2009) found financial literacy to
   be an important factor in determining the demand for financial products, especially among uneducated and
   financially illiterate segments of the population.
                                                              53
Zambians with low financial literacy tend to be less financially included and utilize more informal
products than other respondents. As Figure 36 shows, there are 6 percent fewer adults with a financial
literacy index less than 4 that are financially included than excluded, and 10 percent more adults with a
financial literacy index greater than 4 that are included than excluded. Moreover, there are 24 percent more
adults with a literacy index score less than 4 who use only informal financial products compared to those
utilizing only formal ones, and 15 percent more adults with a literacy index score greater than 4 who use only
formal products than those utilizing only informal ones.

    3.2 Knowledge about Financial Products and Financial
        Inclusion
Studies in various settings have also found that enhanced financial awareness may in turn lead to
higher product up-take. In the U.S., for instance, information about a retirement plan was randomly provided
to a group of university employees. Workers who received the information were substantially more likely to
enroll in the retirement plan than those who did not obtain the information, suggesting that individuals are
more likely to use a financial product once they learn about it and its benefits (Duflo and Saez, 2003). In a
similar vein, Giné et al. (2011) found that in rural India lack of understanding of insurance products is the
second most stated reason for households not to purchase rainfall insurance.

A lack of awareness can prevent people from using financial products that could potentially benefit
them. As detailed in section 1.4, most financially excluded Zambians (63 percent) state they do not have
formal accounts because they lack the money to maintain the accounts, because financial fees are too high
or because financial institutions are too far away. About 15 percent of Zambian adults report that they do not
trust them, initially suggesting that barriers related to lack of knowledge about financial products are not
substantial for the majority of Zambian adults. However, when analyzing how informed Zambian adults
without formal accounts feel about services of various financial providers, their awareness level appears to
be low. Using the financial product awareness index discussed in section 2.2, and categorizing respondents
into five groups according to the number of financial services they know, Figure 37 suggests low awareness
levels even among non-formal account users who state reasons not related to financial awareness barriers.

There is a strong correlation between financial inclusion and product awareness. There is also a
strong correlation between product awareness and the degree of formality in financial products being
utilized. Regression analysis suggests that even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics of Zambian adults, awareness of financial products and the likelihood of owning a formal
account are strongly linked (see Table 22). These correlations are shown in Figure 38. There are 13 percent
more adults with a product awareness score less than 4 who are financially excluded than included, and 14
percent more adults with a product awareness score greater than 4 who are financially included than
excluded. There are 28 percent more adults with a product awareness score less than 4 who only use informal

products than those who only use formal ones and 28 percent more adults with a product awareness score
greater than 4 who only use formal products than those who only use informal ones.

Financially included individuals tend to be more aware about products than those who are excluded
across the whole spectrum of financial services providers. As Figure 36 shows, there are 10, 8, 5, 4, 3,
and 2 percent more financially included adults who are aware of e-money agents, MFIs, money changers,
MTOs, insurance companies or unit trusts, brokerage houses or banks, and national saving and credit
institutions, respectively, compared with financially excluded adults.

    3.3 Financial Attitudes/Behavior and Financial Inclusion
Attitudes and behaviors are another relevant dimension when analyzing financial inclusion. In
developed and developing countries, households and firms are frequently excluded from accessing financial
products because of inadequate credit history, irresponsible financial behavior, or poor business and
accounting records. Eight main components of financial capability related to financial attitudes, motivations,
and behaviors were assessed in the survey.

There are no substantial differences in the financial behavior and attitudes of financially included and
financially excluded respondents. Using the same financial capability scores described in section 2.3,
Figure 40 shows that slight differences arise between Zambians with a formal account and those without in
terms of their financial attitudes and behaviors. The most striking difference is in terms of saving capacity,
where financially excluded adults are 3 points behind financially included ones.

     Box 9. ‘Running Short of Money’ Behavior and Financial Inclusion

Survey results suggest that adults who don’t run short of money for food or other necessary items tend to
be slightly more financially included than those who regularly or sporadically run short of money. As Figure
41 presents, while about 41 percent of those who don’t run shot of money own an account in a formal financial
institution, this index decreases 2 percent among those who declare having this behavior. On the other hand, the
general overview of financial product usage (see also Figure 41) shows that adults who don’t have enough funds for
buying food use more informal credit and MFI credit (only a difference of 1 percent) compared to Zambian adults who
have funds for covering their basic necessities. This last group comparatively uses more money transfers services,
bank and e-money accounts. In terms of bank credit and insurance products, their usage levels are similar.

    4 Financial Consumer Protection
In addition to people’s ability to make sound financial decisions, the latest global financial crisis has
highlighted the importance of financial consumer protection in safeguarding consumers from abusive
sales practices and to level the playing field between providers and consumers of financial services.
Financial consumer protection is about ensuring fair interaction between providers and consumers of financial
services. An effective financial consumer protection regime is essential in counterbalancing the inherent
disadvantage of consumers vis-à-vis the power, information, and resources of providers. Without basic
protective measures, consumers may find it difficult or costly to obtain sufficient information, and even those
who are financially literate may not be able to adequately understand the financial products they use or are
considering to use.
Financial consumer protection is necessary to ensure stable financial markets in Zambia while
ensuring that expanded access benefits consumers and the overall economy. As outlined in section
1.1, a number of initiatives are planned or already underway to increase financial sector outreach to formally
excluded populations. Increased access to finance can result in substantial positive effects, both on the macro
and individual levels. However, it can be detrimental if inexperienced consumers are not protected against
fraud or unfair business practices. Effective financial consumer protection frameworks can help to instill trust
in the formal financial system. A high incidence of conflicts with financial services providers or low levels of
satisfaction with financial products used could undermine the trust in the formal financial system. As well as
making existing consumers worse off, it can also discourage potential new consumers from entering the
market.
This chapter assesses the effectiveness of the current financial consumer protection regime from a
demand-side perspective, with a focus on consumers’ satisfaction with financial products and
services and their experience of handling disputes and seeking redress. In order to measure whether
products are effectively meeting the needs of financially included Zambian adults, the financial capability
survey sought to capture the overall satisfaction of consumers with the nine most common types of providers
and their products and services. To examine the effectiveness of existing consumer redress mechanisms,
this survey also asked users of financial services to share their experiences with current internal and external
redress mechanisms, and identified segments of the population that are more likely to have encountered a
dispute with a financial services provider in the past three years.

     4.1 Consumers’ Satisfaction with Financial Products
In general, users of financial services express satisfaction with the services offered by financial
service providers, especially MTOs and insurance companies. Figure 42 provides a more detailed
picture. Consumers are least satisfied with banks, national savings, or credit institutions than most other types
of financial institutions, although the satisfaction level is still 79 percent. Insurance products and money
transfer services have the highest satisfaction rates from consumers, with an approval rating of 91 and 92
percent, respectively. Among those who ever used banks, national savings or credit institutions, low income
groups and young adults (less than 35 years old) are less satisfied with their products than other adults.
Significant differences also exist in satisfaction levels between different regions with services provided by
banks, national savings, or credit institutions.
Figure 42. Clients’ Satisfaction with Services Provided by Common Types of Financial Institutions




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Zambia 2016.

Young adults and low income individuals tend to be less satisfied with services provided by
commercial and postal banks. Figure 43 shows that the satisfaction rate for adults under 35 years of age
averages 78 percent, which is less than that of people aged between 35 and 54 (80 percent) or aged over 54
(79 percent), and that the satisfaction level for the poorest population (76 percent) is lower than for the richest
one (79 percent).

Historically, the use of banks and national savings or credit institution has been more or less at the
same levels across the various regions of Zambia. Map 5 demonstrates that the historical usage rate
varies between about 90 and 95 percent across all regions. Provinces with the highest historical usage include
Copperbelt and Lusaka. Provinces with the lowest historical usage are Luapula and North Western.

Clients’ satisfaction with banks and national saving and credit institutions does not vary much
between regions. As drawn in Map 6, clients’ satisfaction rate is between 75 and about 81 percent across
all provinces. Copperbelt and Western were found to have the highest satisfaction level. Central and Southern
have the lowest satisfaction rates.

    4.2 Consumers’ Approaches in Dealing with Provider
        Conflicts
Around 13 percent of adults encountered a conflict with a financial services provider, but only 25
percent of this group tried to resolve it. As shown in Figure 44, respondents who encountered conflicts
(13 percent of respondents) tried to resolve these in one out of four cases. Among people who did not
encounter a dispute (87 percent), a higher proportion (38 percent) said that, if they were to have one, they
would try to solve it.




                                                        62
Figure 44. Approaches in Dealing with Financial Services Provider Conflicts




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Zambia 2016.

In-depth analysis of socio-demographic factors has shown that more men than women, and fewer
young adults than older adults, have had a dispute with a financial services provider. Figure 42 shows
that 4 percent more men than women (by 4 percent) have had a dispute with a financial services provider.
Also, 2 percent fewer young adults experienced conflicts with such institutions.
Figure 45. Overview of Disputes by Social and Demographics Factors




Source: WBG Financial Capability Survey, Zambia 2016.

There is a wide regional disparity in terms of disputes with financial providers, with North Western
and Eastern registering the highest levels and Central and Northern & Muchinga the lowest levels, as
shown in Map 7. North Western and Eastern are the regions with the highest proportion of conflicts with
financial institutions (15.3 to 17.4 percent) and Central and Northern & Muchinga have the lowest ratio of
disputes with providers (10.8 to 11.3 percent).

The most frequent action taken by adults who tried to solve their dispute with a financial services
provider was to stop using the service before the contract ended. Other measures undertaken, as
shown in Figure 43, included submitting a grievance to the provider or a claim to the appropriate
government authority. Among adults who tried to resolve a conflict with a provider, stopping use of the
service before the contract ended was the main action taken (97 percent). The second most frequent action
taken was submitting a grievance to the company that sold the product (41 percent). The third most frequent
measure taken was delivering a claim to the appropriate government authority.

                                                        64
The main cause for inertia by adults who did not try to solve disputes with financial services providers
is the lack of awareness of the proper government agency to contact. As Figure 44 shows, the rest of
the sampled population believe that financial institutions are too powerful or that government
authorities or the law do not function adequately. 85 percent of respondents claimed that they do not
know which government agency should be approached to resolve a dispute. 64 percent believe that financial
organizations are too powerful and 29 percent mention that government authorities do not function
competently.

Adults who did not take any action to settle a dispute with a financial services provider were mostly
male, and from the young generation, rural areas, the highest income quartile, with only primary
education, and either informally employed or self-employed. As shown in Figure 48, 14 percent more
men than women did not attempt to solve their conflict with the provider
