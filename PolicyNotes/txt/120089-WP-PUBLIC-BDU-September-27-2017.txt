Executive Summary
The economy is moving forward at a strong pace despite internal and external headwinds. Poverty reduction
underpinned by job creation has continued, albeit at a slower pace due to lower remittances, flat exports, higher food
prices and adverse natural shocks. Macroeconomic management has remained prudent, as reflected in decelerating
inflation and rising foreign exchange reserves. However, the banking system remains stressed with high levels of non-
performing loans (NPLs), while financial development is hampered by the dominance of National Saving Certificates
as a key source of deficit financing. Structural reforms have not only stalled but also slipped. Despite an improving
global outlook, growth in Bangladesh is projected to slow to 6.4 percent in FY18. Downside risks include the
resurgence of political instability in the run up to elections planned for early 2019, and a hardening of credit
constraints with increased insolvency of banks due to rising NPLs. Excess liquidity and reduced fiscal space
associated with costly domestic financing of the budget deficit present latent risks to macroeconomic stability. The
near and medium-term policies must focus on more and better jobs creation. To this end, comprehensive and well-
coordinated policy efforts are needed that aim to (i) improve the macro and business environment; (ii) strengthen
regional and sectoral policies; and (iii) enhance the labor market and skills.

Despite some headwinds, the Bangladesh economy continued to maintain healthy growth. GDP
growth in FY17 is officially estimated at 7.24 percent. Among the drivers, manufacturing and services
contributed the most on the supply side, while private consumption and public investment contributed on
the demand side. The overall investment rate has increased, underpinned by a rise in public investment
where quality is a concern; private investment remained lackluster, while volatile exports experienced a
growth deceleration and remittances through official channels plummeted.

Macroeconomic stability sustained. Non-food inflation slowed to 4.6 percent and headline inflation
decelerated to 5.4 percent in FY17, aided by prudent monetary management and weak aggregate demand.
A robust financial account surplus in the balance of payments boosted official foreign exchange reserves
despite a $1.5 billion current account deficit. The exchange rate has depreciated both in nominal and real
effective terms in recent months, a correction that was long overdue. Lending rates continued to decline,
though at a very sluggish pace not commensurate with the size of excess liquidity in the financial sector.
The banking system remained stressed by the high level of NPLs and the concentration of loans. The fiscal
deficit has increased to nearly 5 percent of GDP, with more than half of the deficit financed from expensive
domestic sources.

Survey evidence reaffirms declining poverty trends. The share of the population living under the official
upper poverty line fell from 31.5 percent in 2010 to 24.3 percent in 2016/17, continuing Bangladesh’s trend
of impressive poverty decline. Between 2010 and 2016 poverty fell both in rural and urban areas, but the
reduction was larger in rural areas. Although poverty rates have been falling consistently, the shortfall or
depth of poverty has remained constant over the past years.
The resilience of poverty reduction cannot be taken for granted. The annual pace of poverty reduction
slowed since 2010. Officially recorded remittances declined by 16.6 percent in FY16-17, which may have
contributed to the deceleration. In addition, urban households may have been impacted by flat garment
exports and rising food prices. Of late, natural disasters (landslides, above normal floods, fungal disease
blast attacks affecting crop yields) may have countered gains in reducing poverty. Severe monsoon
flooding in the north and north-eastern regions has adversely affected the livelihoods of over 8 million
people in 32 districts, which could have deepened poverty temporarily or even permanently for some.

Substantial progress in jobs outcomes. Between 2003 and 2016 the Bangladesh economy generated more
than 1.15 million net jobs per year, on average, among the working age (15-64) population, with overall
employment growing 2.4 percent annually. Trade integration through exports in the ready-made garments
(RMG) sector has been a critical catalyst of job-creating industrialization and urbanization. A large inflow
of remittances from migrants has likely contributed to boosting domestic demand. Still, the pace of job

                                                                                                                    1
creation has fallen sharply in recent years. While other manufacturing sectors are growing rapidly to meet
increasing domestic demand, export oriented sectors beyond RMG need to emerge to create quality jobs on
a large scale.
Structural reforms stagnated or experienced slippages. The government made moderate progress on
large infrastructure projects, while at the same time back-tracking on key reforms in taxation and the
financial sector. With elections slated for the middle of FY19, the government is likely to avoid sensitive
structural reforms over the next two fiscal years.
Growth is projected to remain robust. Growth in advanced economies - Bangladesh’s major export
markets - is projected to pick-up modestly to 1.9 percent in 2017, and stabilize at 1.8 percent in 2018. The
growth rates of Bangladesh’s exports and remittances are projected to recover, but remain below their
historic double-digit averages. This together with the damages caused by floods to agricultural output and
infrastructure could drag growth down in FY18 to 6.4 percent, followed by a rise back to 6.7 percent in
FY19.
Macroeconomic stability could come under pressure. Inflation may accelerate to nearly 6 percent
because of overheating and supply shocks. However, prudent monetary management is expected to keep
inflation in a manageable range. The current account deficit is expected to persist. The budget deficit is
likely to increase, and not just because of election pressure on public expenditures and revenue
mobilization. The public debt to GDP ratio is projected to rise, but remain below levels associated with
debt distress.
Downside risks are primarily domestic. The downside risks to the outlook include a revival of political
unrest in the run-up to elections, a protracted slowdown in key export markets (particularly the EU and
US), a further easing of remittances, a hardening of credit constraints, and a weakening of corporate
governance in the banking system. Excess liquidity and a reduction in fiscal space through cost inefficient
domestic financing of the budget deficit present latent risks to macroeconomic stability. Export demand
and remittances could surprise on the upside.

Reforms need acceleration. Notwithstanding laudable achievements in reducing poverty and boosting
shared prosperity, Bangladesh’s near and medium-term policy challenges remain formidable. Investment
needs are large, both for increasing productivity and employment. Bangladesh must take advantage of the
global recovery to undertake institutional and market reforms, which can attract domestic and foreign
private investment as well as stimulate innovative activities to help sustain growth in the long term.

A policy agenda for more, better, inclusive jobs. Comprehensive and well-coordinated policy efforts are
needed to deliver shared prosperity for all parts of Bangladeshi society. Policies related to the investment
climate will be necessary to promote more trade and investment, diversify the manufacturing sector, and
expand high-productivity services. For labor markets, actions will need to promote the quality and relevance
of education and skills of workers, provide services to link workers to job opportunities in both domestic
and international markets, and facilitate entrepreneurship. These will need to be delivered while also
expanding worker protection and social insurance. Finally, sectoral and regional policies will be needed to
strengthen firm capabilities, extend domestic supply chains, and encourage innovation, while supporting
the development of secondary cities and facilitating urban-rural connectivity.

Recent Economic Developments
Despite significant headwinds, the economy continued to impress with healthy growth. Among the drivers,
manufacturing and services contributed most on the supply side while private consumption and public investment
contributed on the demand side. A big anomaly on the demand side estimates was “statistical discrepancy”. In
addition, the official growth estimate for FY17 is hard to reconcile with high frequency indicators.

Growth and Poverty Trends

Healthy output growth sustained. Officially reported output growth rose to 7.24 percent in FY17 from
7.1 percent in the preceding fiscal year, driven by both services and manufacturing growth. On the demand
side, private consumption and public investment contributed, but a large contribution of “statistical
discrepancy” remains puzzling (Table-1).

Preliminary estimates show the agricultural sector’s contribution to growth increased from 0.43
percentage point in FY16 to 0.5 percentage point in FY17. Timely availability of inputs and finance helped
achieve good acreage and hence a higher growth estimate of 3.4 percent in FY17 compared to 2.8 percent
in FY16 (Figure-1). However, back-to-back disasters – flashfloods in haor areas and Chalan Beel in Natore,
intense rainfall in almost all parts of the country, and fungal disease blast attacks—caused a significant
production setback that will not have been factored in the BBS’s preliminary estimate of agricultural
growth.

Food production short of target. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) set a target for domestic
food grains (rice and wheat) production at 36.6 million metric tons (mmt) in FY17, which is about 1.5
percent higher than the actual production of 36.1 mmt in the past year. The production of aman is 1.28
percent higher but that of aus is 1.27

output would be significantly below
the 19.2 mmt production target. Under Source: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics
these circumstances, total food grains production in FY17 is likely to have been lower than the target.
Manufacturing dominated industrial growth. The contribution of the industry sector was about 3.18
percentage points, compared with 3.24 percent percentage points in FY16. Industry’s contribution is
underpinned by the manufacturing sector, which accounted for 70 percent of the sector’s contribution,
despite much weaker export growth.

repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles

Poverty has continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace. The share of the population living under the
official upper poverty line fell from 31.5 percent in 2010 to 24.3 percent in 2016/17. This represents a 24.5
percentage point reduction in the upper poverty rate since 2000, and a 7-percentage point fall since 2010.
The latter is a slower annual rate of poverty reduction than before 2010. Also, although poverty rates have
been reducing consistently, the shortfall or depth of poverty has remained constant over the past years.
Officially recorded remittances declined by a cumulative 16.6 percent in FY16 and FY17 and this may have
contributed to the deceleration in progress reducing poverty. In addition, urban households may have been

impacted by declining garment exports growth and rising food prices. Between 2010 and 2016, poverty
fell both in rural and urban areas, but the reduction was larger in rural areas.
Of late, natural disasters (landslides, above normal floods, fungal blast attacks affecting agricultural
production) and rising food inflation, may have countered gains in reducing poverty. Severe monsoon
flooding in the north and north-eastern regions has affected the livelihoods of over 8 million people in 32
districts, which could have deepened poverty temporarily or even permanently for some. Before the country
could recover from the losses it suffered from an extensive flood in May-June, another flood of far greater
magnitude struck 32 districts in northeastern, northwestern and central regions. Innumerable houses,
hundreds of schools, roads and other structures have again gone under water (Box -1). Aman seedbeds have
been destroyed and fish stocks, lost. Many affected families had problems in finding raised lands for their
livestock. Scarcity of food and pure drinking water also emerged as a serious problem.

Bangladesh is facing a massive influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. More than 400,000 people
from the minority group in Buddhist majority Myanmar crossed over into Bangladesh in less than three
weeks since August 25. Bangladesh authorities, United Nations Agencies and NGOs have been struggling
to provide food, shelter, water and medicine to so many people in such a short time. The UNHCR fears if
the current trend continues, the number of refugees could cross 1 million. The influx was triggered by the
Myanmar army’s response to insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base in Rakhine on August
25, 2017.
                                    Box 1: Floods Strike Twice in a Row
 Bangladesh’s vulnerability to natural disasters was proved again this year with two consecutive floods in April and
 August. Bangladeshis are familiar with flash floods and associated damages, but the second surge of flooding in
 August is marked as the worst in recent years. It submerged 32 districts in the north and central parts of the country,
 with the overflowing of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river affecting 8 million people and killing at least 140.

 The two consecutive floods brought grave risk to food security. The floods destroyed about 623,402 hectares of
 crops. Simultaneously, rice stocks in government silos hit their lowest levels in six years, leading to a sharp rise in
 the rice price by 19.4 percent since the first flash flood hit the Haor (wetland) basin in April. An estimated 0.8
 million tons of boro rice was damaged during the Hoar flash flood. Along with that, 18,835 hectares of the aus crop
 and 7,687 hectares of the aman crop went under water since June 26. During the same period, 2,554 hectares of
 aman seedbeds, 20,125 hectares of jute, 3,806 hectares of vegetables, 412 hectares of sugarcane, 130 hectares of
 shifting crops in the hill tracts districts and 206 hectares of standing chili crop and orchards was reportedly
 submerged. In addition, these two floods also caused damage to water borne animals. The floods have so far caused
 about Tk. 36 million worth of livestock damage, that includes damage to cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep, ducks and
 poultry flocks. Sending aid to the affected area is a major challenge. Communication with the north is hampered
 by severe damage to roads and highways. So far, 9,000 km of roads and 457 bridges and culverts are reportedly
 damaged. Rail communication also had to be suspended due to flooding. Approximately 100 km of rail lines are
 damaged.

 Flood affected people are at risk of water-borne diseases. They need fresh drinking water, food and medicines on
 an urgent basis. The government and international organizations are pulling together their resources to help meet
 their immediate needs.

 Besides causing immediate hardship, floods lead to long-term adverse consequences in terms of assets and income
 losses as well as a rise in expenditures. The Research and Evaluation Department (RED) of the Bangladesh Rural
 Advancement Committee (BRAC) recently estimated the monetary impact of the floods in the haor areas at about
 Tk 60 billion ($750 million). These include destruction of assets (cows, ducks, withdrawing children from schools,
 depletion of savings), loss of labor man-days in agriculture and other activities, and extra expenditures for treating
 water-borne diseases.

percent in FY17, while the national
savings-GDP ratio declined by 0.5 percentage point to 30.3 percent in FY17.

Surge in imports of capital machinery. Bangladesh’s import payments, based on letters of credit (LC)
settlement data, rose by 10.5 percent in FY17.1 Imports of industrial raw materials and capital goods have
grown by 3.3 percent and 37.4 percent, respectively. An analysis of the structure of imports over the last
five years do not show any major shift. However, the share of capital goods has been on the rise – from 20
percent in total imports in FY13 to 31.3 percent in FY17. The share of capital machinery has also increased
significantly. With the undertaking of several mega projects, equipment imports have risen considerably.


Export growth has declined. The growth of export earnings was only 1.7 percent in FY 17 (nominal U.S.
dollar terms) compared with 9.8 percent in FY16. In real terms, exports declined by 0.6 percent according
to preliminary estimates released by BBS. In FY17, the government had set an export target of US$ 37
billion which was missed by nearly US$ 2.2 billion. The weak performance is mainly attributable to the fall
in the RMG earnings, largely driven by the 2.3 percent decline in woven garments. Overall RMG growth
was only 0.2 percent. Non-RMG growth was strong in FY17, thus helping to keep overall export earnings
growth positive. Non-RMG growth drivers were mainly pharmaceuticals (8.6 percent), light engineering
(35 percent) and non-RMG manufactured goods (13.4 percent). Since RMG exports dominate
overwhelmingly, the non-RMG exports were unable to raise total export growth significantly. The
performance in non-RMG exports has been higher than the 7.4 percent targeted, while that in RMG has
been vastly below the target of 8.1 percent growth.
The decline is attributable to slower growth in export prices and worsening trade logistic bottlenecks.
Per the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the price

  Food imports surged in the latter half of the year as the government drastically cut duties on rice imports in
response to crop damages caused by unprecedented floods.

growth of Bangladesh’s exports was likely to have declined in 2017 to 3.8 percent from 4.2 percent in 2016.
Further in-depth analysis reveals that price dynamics are in play behind the falling growth of import values
in the US and the EU markets. In the US, the average price of woven apparels has experienced a secular
decline since 2014. According to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association
(BGMEA), Bangladeshi garment prices experienced 15 percent cut in last two years in the US market.
Some US brands and retailers substantially reduced work orders because of criticism from customer groups
for sourcing their products from Bangladesh on grounds of non-compliance with labor standards. Similarly,
in the EU, the trend has been the same for the dominant knitwear item. The volume-driven nature of export
earnings performance (as against a price-driven one) becomes apparent from these key markets.2

Little progress on export diversification of both products and markets. RMG exports have continued
to hover around 80 percent of total exports, but its growth has slowed in recent years, which in turn has

  Also, the management at the Chittagong port worsened because of container congestion due to equipment shortages
and unstable labor and outsourced contractor relations. Bangladesh’s two existing commercial ports. These have
increased lead times, which already was a problem confronting Bangladesh. It was reported that the container handling
operation had slowed down in June 2017 forcing vessels to overstay from 7 to 10 days against a normal turnaround
time of 2 to 3 days at the Chittagong port. Chittagong and Mongla, together handle trade estimated at $60 billion per
annum. Chittagong is the main port handling 98 percent of the country’s container cargo (1.8m teu per annum) and
92 percent of the total cargo volume which includes 30m tons of bulk cargo per annum. The current rate of cargo
growth at Chittagong is estimated at 15 percent per annum. It is expected that available capacity at the port will be
exhausted as early as 2018. So, in addition to there being a deep-water port requirement, there is also a looming new
capacity requirement. Deep water is required to offer the lower freight rate costs that come with bigger ships and
capacity has to be added because existing capacity is fast running out. Bangladesh has not added any new port since
independence in 1971.

  Within RMG, the top five items making up more than 74 percent of total RMG exports experienced a decline..

  As may be recalled, in the EU market, export performance of Bangladesh received a boost in 2012 due to the
relaxation of rules of origin (RoO) requirement from two stage to single-stage processing. Whilst the initial boost
this has given Bangladesh has gradually tapered off, Bangladesh appears to be benefitting from the comparative
advantage originating from the favorable RoO for woven RMG items.

  These three countries account for 15.7, 4.2 and 5.4 percent of total exports respectively.

Bangladesh could not reap fully the growth dividends from falling global commodity prices.
Bangladesh’s terms of trade (ToT) has been showing a secularly declining trend since the new base was
established (FY2005-06). Despite the 52.1 percent decrease in the price of crude oil since its peak in 2014,
one of the major import components, Bangladesh’s terms of trade declined by 13 percent since FY06 and
remained nearly unchanged since FY13. Overall, average export-weighted prices of Bangladesh could not
keep up with average import-weighted price of Bangladesh, leading to decline and subsequent stability in
ToT.

Remittances remain stressed. Officially recorded remittances declined for the second consecutive year to
reach US$ 12.7 billion. The decline in FY17, at 14.5 percent, was much more pronounced than the 2.5

The fall in remittance is a global phenomenon. Remittance flows to developing countries are estimated
to have declined by 2.4 percent, to $429 billion in 2016, after a decline of 1 percent in 2015.6 However, the
depth and consistency in the fall of remittances has been particularly severe for Bangladesh and India when
compared to other countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The decline in remittances from GCC countries
can be mainly attributed to the decline in oil prices. Additionally, the GCC countries have also introduced
fiscal measures, such as a tax on non-nationals, energy price increase and subsidy rationalization, which
increased the cost of living for the expatriate workers.7

Remittances to Bangladesh have declined despite an increasing stock of workers abroad. Migrant
outflows to GCC countries increased by 54 percent. During FY17, a total of 751,410 expatriate
Bangladeshis went to GCC countries, accounting for 84 percent of total migrant outflows for the year. Over
50 percent of this population went to Saudi Arabia, followed by Oman and Qatar. The UAE, Malaysia and
Singapore, which were the more traditional destinations for Bangladeshi workers, have continued to
decline. Although no reliable data is available on return migrants, net migration has also been quite high.
Approximately a fourth of the new migrants were women, with low-paying jobs, only partially explains
falling remittances despite the rising stock of Bangladeshi workers abroad.

There has been significant diversion to informal channels. Bangladesh Bank’s field investigation to
identify the reasons for the decline in officially recorded remittances indicate that a significant part of the
fall may be explained by a substitution between formal and informal channels of money transfers,
particularly from the Middle East, Singapore, Malaysia and the US. Note that the size of decline in
remittances from the US was the largest, compared with any other single source country (Table-2). Many
migrant workers are sending money through intermediaries who are taking advantage of mobile platforms
and various software applications. A BBS survey revealed that there has been a significant shift away from
banking to mobile banking and hundi channels in 2016 relative to 2013.8 Some of the reasons behind these
trends are higher exchange rate margins, quicker transaction processing, convenient access, and lower
service fees compared to the banks in host countries. These are lowering the costs of sending remittances
back to Bangladesh. In addition, de-risking by banks has made remittances through banking channels more
difficult.

8
 The proportion of expatriate workers sending through banks decreased from 67.3 percent in 2013 to 50.7 percent in
2016 and the proportion sending through mobile financial services increased from none in 2013 to 14.3 percent in
2016. See BBS, Report of the Survey on Investment from Remittance (SIR) 2016, June 2016.

                                                                                                                9
Bangladesh continues to be one of the largest recipient of remittances in the world. Large declines
notwithstanding, annual remittances remain several times the combined aid and FDI flows. Remittances
have been making an important contribution to the balance of payments by helping finance the trade,
services and income account deficits. Remittances growth had been resilient to external shocks such as the
global financial crisis of 2008-2009, economic slowdown in advanced economies, and the initial decline in
oil prices in 2014. While not a macro concern currently, given robust capital inflows and a still comfortable
$3.2 billion surplus in the overall balance of payments, it has serious implications for families, particularly
in the rural areas, that depend on remittances. Declining remittances may assume significance at the macro
level if the current account deficit persists and official and private capital flows reverse at some point.

Assessment of Official Growth Estimates

The official preliminary growth estimates appear to be somewhat overstated. On the demand side, a large contribution
of “statistical discrepancy” remains a major anomaly, particularly since total investment is also likely to hav e been
overestimated. Additionally, the high frequency indicators do not exhibit any sign of an economy achieving its highest
ever rate of growth in recent memory. That said, there is convincing evidence that growth has remained healthy by
contemporary international standards.

This assessment is based on several factors. On the demand side, statistical discrepancy accounts for 2.03
percentage points out of the 7.24 percent growth estimated for FY17, constituting over 28 percent of total
growth. Investment in plant, machinery and transport equipment is estimated at $20.7 billion whereas total
imports of capital machinery and machinery for miscellaneous industry (which includes transport) was only
$9.5 billion.9 Except cement and steel, Bangladesh does not have any capital goods producing industry
worth reckoning. While some high frequency indicators (Table-3) show better performance than last year,

construction materials do not. In addition, the estimates were made before unseasonal floods struck the
haor areas, significantly damaging the standing boro crops (estimated at around 0.8-1 million tons) which
could not have been accounted for in the estimation of agricultural value added. Note that the provisional
estimate of GDP has been prepared with limited available information, covering half of the fiscal year. The
value addition of manufacturing sector has been estimated without full year data which could not have
captured the falling growth rate of export earnings later in the year. Public consumption and investment
estimates are most likely based on the original budget projections, which are over-estimates. These
notwithstanding, the FY17 GDP growth outcome is still likely to have been strong, particularly when
compared to global trends.


Macroeconomic and Financial Stability
Macroeconomic stability has been sustained, but financial stability remained at risk. Nonfood inflation declined, aided
by prudent monetary management and weak aggregate demand growth. Lending rates continued to decline, though
at a very sluggish pace not commensurate with the size of excess liquidity in the banking system. The banking system
remained stressed by high NPLs and concentration of loans. Robust financial account surplus in the balance of
payments helped maintain reserve growth. With a major turnaround in the current account balance into $1.5 billion

sources.

Inflation

Inflation has declined. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined to 5.4 percent in FY17. This was within
the Bangladesh Bank’s Monetary Policy
Statement (MPS) target of 5.3-5.6 percent          18.0

                                                   16.0

with the current inflationary trends. Bangladesh

Food inflation, on the other hand, has been increasing. Food inflation averaged slightly over 6 percent
for the year in FY17, compared with 4.9 percent in FY16. Rising price of rice has driven the food inflation
upwards. Rice accounts for 23 percent in the commodity basket of the CPI. Coarse rice price in June was
about 44.7 percent higher than a year ago. Prices of other varieties of rice are also about 15-18 percent
higher. Rising food inflation is bane for the poorer consumers who are most affected since (coarse) rice is
the single most important commodity in their consumption basket.

Rise in food inflation reflects mostly cost push factors. These include rise in tariffs on rice imports as
well as production shortfalls due to early floods and blast outbreak and decline in public stocks. Measures
taken recently by the government such as reduction of duties, allowing zero-rated LC margin requirements

     for rice imports and government to government procurement of rice from Vietnam should have helped ease
     rice prices, but rise in rice prices in India, Thailand and Vietnam partially negated their effects.

     Monetary Developments

     Monetary management has remained generally prudent. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) kept the monetary
     aggregates broadly in line with their programmed paths in the Monetary Policy Statements (MPS) for FY17
     (Table-4). The three important anchors of the monetary program - Reserve Money (RM), Broad Money
     (M2), and domestic credit - grew by 16.3, 10.9 and 11.2 percent in FY17, respectively. Broad Money and
     domestic credit growth were well below the program ceilings, thus helping achieve the favorable inflation
     performance in FY17. Credit to the public sector declined by 12 percent, as the government paid off
     maturing T-bills/T-bonds with proceeds from booming sales of NSCs.

     financing through NSCs in FY17 exceeded
     the budgetary target by a massive margin (more below). High administered yields, ranging between 11 to

inflationary impact than bank borrowing, and leaves greater room for private sector’s bank borrowing .
However, it reduces the government’s fiscal space and hinders the much-needed bond market development
for mobilizing savings for infrastructure and other long-term investments.
Excess liquidity growth slowed. The pickup in credit growth exceeded deposit growth, thus moderating
excess liquidity as measured by the ratio of excess of Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR) assets to Total
Demand and Time Liabilities (TDTL). At around 11.2 percent end-June, 2017, the relative size of "excess
of SLR" assets are now back at their 2012 levels.10 Total demand and time deposits grew by 10.6 percent,
exceeding the growth in domestic credit by half a percentage point. Call money rates have tended to rise
recently. Yet large excess liquidity remains which weakens the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
However, the ability of monetary authorities to influence demand conditions in the economy depend on the
extent to which bank holdings of excess liquidity exceed levels required for precautionary purposes. BB
has taken a passive approach to domestic liquidity management. It has been sterilizing only part of the
liquidity from the external inflows. This has kept market interest rates low and short-term real rates negative
for some time. Of late, liquidity growth has been partially stunted by falling remittances, but the concern
that the sustained low interest rate environment might encourage banks to take excessive risks and loosen
lending standards remains. BB should increase its sterilization efforts, particularly if remittances rebound,
through open market operations to head off an abrupt and disruptive tightening which might be needed
down the road to contain financial sector risks.
The Financial Sector
Distress in the banking sector continues. The banking sector, which dominates the financial sector in
Bangladesh, has continued to struggle. While the sector’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is above the 10
percent requirement of the Basel II framework, the overall asset quality deteriorated in 2016. Seven banks
failed to maintain the regulatory capital requirement and this problem is acute amongst the State-Owned
Banks (SOB). In 2016, the CAR of State-Owned Commercial Banks (SCB) and State Owned Development
Banks (SDB) was 5.9 percent and -33.7 percent respectively. The magnitude of their capital shortfall has
prompted the government to once again keep a budgetary provision for their recapitalization.
Asset quality has deteriorated. The gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio increased to 9.2 percent in
                                                    2016 from 8.8 percent in 2015 (Figure-8). The

 30                                                 asset quality of the SCBs continues to remain poor

lending and deposit rates, the interest rate spread has been stagnant at 4.7 percent (Figure 9). Protecting
profitability amidst the default loan culture makes banks reluctant to decrease the spread on the interest rate
despite holding a high level of liquidity. The absence of good borrowers and a poor legal framework to
recover default loans has also been instrumental in the banking sector’s increase in risk aversion.

Overall profitability increased. The banking sector profitability increased by 4.9 percent in 2016. It was
mainly driven by the strong performance of the PCBs and Foreign Commercial Banks (FCB). Profits of
PCBs rose by nearly 17 percent in 2016. The overall industry profitability was brought down by the SCBs
with Sonali Bank and Rupali Bank making significant losses. Janata Bank’s profit in 2016 declined by 48
percent, while the profit of Agrani Bank increased by 9.7 percent. As shown in Table 5, the improved
profitability helped the Banks to maintain their Return on Assets (ROA) and marginally improve their
Return on Equity (ROE). By managing the interest rate spread, the banks were also able to improve their
net interest margin. However, their operating expenses increased significantly from 2015. The increase in
operating expenses was also more pronounced for the SCBs. Barring Janata Bank, all the other SCBs
crossed the operating expense threshold set by the Bangladesh Bank. While, the implicit government
guarantee on the deposits of the SCBs limits their systemic threat to the overall financial sector, but their
poor performance, poses a fiscal risk to the government and is also an impediment to a modernized financial
sector. The increase in profitability of the PCBs highlights the improved performance of the PCBs over the
last year, but recent amendments to the Bank Companies Act and potential changes to the single borrower
exposure limit may open the PCBs to unwarranted risks. While these amendments are being contemplated
by policymakers and Bangladesh Bank, no reform initiatives have been taken to improve management
structure, board appointments, financial reporting and credit growth limits guidelines of the SCBs.
Capital market has been bullish. The general index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) ended the fiscal
year with a 25 percent gain over the previous fiscal year. There was some volatility in the stock prices
during January and February (Figure 10) mainly due to the healthy earnings reports of the Banking and
Non-Banking sectors. As highlighted above, the private banks (most of whom are listed in the Dhaka Stock
Exchange) had improved their profitability in 2016 and being the largest sector in the exchange, they
experienced a surge in investors interests. The market Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio stabilized to 15.7 after
reaching nearly 16.4 in March. It subsequently rose to 17.8 in mid-September. Notwithstanding the
moderate gains over the last year, it is quite evident that complete confidence has not returned to the capital
market. Furthermore, the government has also been slow to progress on implementing the Capital Market
Development Master Plan which was drawn up after 2011 stock market crash. The government has made
progress in improving the function and regulation of capital markets. But the rules and regulations

only has implication for the development of a robust capital market, but it also means that the government’s
interest burden will increase despite a stable debt to GDP ratio.

coverage. This makes the outright elimination of NSCs very difficult. At the same time, it is also
recognized that excessive reliance on NSCs for budget financing not only impedes capital market
development but also hampers monetary policy management. NSCs are currently poorly targeted and
misuse of the system is increasing. To combat this, the government is striving to improve monitoring to
better understand who is benefiting from NSCs. Aligning NSCs rates with market interest rates could also
contain the distortionary impact of NSC on the functioning of financial markets. Consideration could be
given to better targeted and less costly alternatives that achieve the government’s social policy goals without
distorting financial markets.
Balance of Payments and the Exchange Rate

Trade and services deficits have ballooned. The external position remained robust as reflected in
adequate reserve levels and current account surpluses until FY17 (Table-5). A steady global market share
suggests that the country’s exports have remained competitive. However, in FY17, the external sector
dynamics changed rather dramatically as export growth declined, remittances plummeted and import
growth increased. The trade deficit increased from $6.5 billion in FY16 to $9.5 billion in FY17 while deficit
in the services account increased from $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion. With 14.5 percent decline in remittances,

the current account balance turned negative for the first time over the last five years and stood at US$ 1.5

Reserves growth slackened. Rapid growth in garment exports and remittances have dominated the balance
of payments over the last several years raising reserves to around eight months of merchandize imports.
The accompanying productivity growth has also allowed for 6.5 percent appreciation of the real exchange
rate in 2016 (Figure-12). Despite large current account deficit, the overall balance of payment surplus was

to the cumulative pressure originating from the rise in L/C settlement, higher demand for foreign loan
repayments and declining remittance flow through the banking channels. However, BB did allow the
interbank rate to creep up, allowing it greater flexibility to adjust to excess demand pressures emerging
from the rise in current account deficit.

Fiscal Outturns

Fiscal deficit has increased. As expected, revenues fell well short of budget target in FY17. NBR revenue
growth target of 38.9 percent, set in the FY17 Budget, compared to the actual collection in FY17 was highly
ambitious. Growth target in the revised budget was reduced to26 percent, driven by growth in indirect tax
revenue collection, particularly VAT and supplementary duties. The tax-GDP ratio increased from 8.8
percent in FY16 to at best 9.1 percent in FY17, still significantly below countries at a comparable level of
development. Current expenditure has been increasing due to increases in subsidy and transfer as well as
pay and allowances. Total expenditure was short of budget target as well, but unlike in previous years,
expenditure shortfall relative to budget was equal to the revenue shortfall as percentage of GDP.
Consequently, the revised budget deficit was exactly as envisaged in the original budget—5 percent of GDP
(Table-7).

Tax revenue base remains narrow. Top ten taxpayers paid 78.5 percent of the total VAT collected by the
Large Taxpayers Unit in FY17. Of the total collected by LTU, 50 percent came from one tobacco company
alone. The number of companies under the VAT LTU has in fact decreased in recent years. There remains
a large unrealized potential of increasing VAT collection from the existing registered companies. The
amount of VAT collected but not paid was Tk 17 billion in 35 cases.11 The good news is that the number
of income-tax returns filed by individual taxpayers increased from 1 million to 1.55 million in FY17 due to

The pace of ADP implementation improved somewhat: ADP implementation was 63.8 percent during
July-May of FY17, compared with 60.8 percent implementation during the same period of FY16. The
recovery was driven by higher expenditure of local resources. Utilization of aided projects was lowest in
last five years. The pace of implementation of some of the fast track projects have been largely on track.
However, implementation of deep sea port projects at both Paira and Sonadia appears to have stalled. Slow
pace of progress of these mega projects will likely result in higher cost.

The composition of deficit finance has tilted further towards domestic sources. Domestic financing of
deficit increased from 2.9 percent of GDP in FY16 to an estimated 3.8 percent in FY17 and exceeded the
FY17 original budget target by 0.7 percentage point of GDP. The government repaid Tk 325.9 billion to
the banking system while borrowing Tk 475.2 billion from nonbank sources, almost all from the sale of the
NSCs. The public debt as percent of GDP has been declining steadily in recent years, but the rapidly
shifting composition of deficit financing towards expensive sources coupled with rising level of deficit
could easily reverse this trend in the near term.

Structural Reforms
The pace of structural reforms has slowed considerably over the last year. The government made moderate progress
on the large infrastructure projects, while at the same time back-tracked on key reforms in taxation and the financial
sector. With elections stated for the middle of FY19, it is highly likely that the government’s priority over t he next two
fiscal years would be the completion of the big-ticket infrastructure projects and avoiding any sensitive structural
reforms.

Financial Sector: Reforms to curb the rise in Non-Performing Loans continues to elude the financial
sector. The change to the Bank Companies Act during the early part of the year can further weaken the
corporate governance structure within the banking sector.
The Ministry of Finance has decided to establish a Financial Stability Council (FSC) to deal with crises in
the financial sector including banks and financial institutions (FIs). The major role of the proposed FSC
would be assisting systemic troubled banks and FIs, management of financial sector stability, improvement
of resolution regime for financial institutions; and designing of macroprudential regulations and
instruments. The new FSC would include representatives of all the financial sector regulators like Ministry
of Finance, Bangladesh Bank, Bangladesh Security and Exchange Commission (BSEC), Microcredit
Regulatory Authority (MRA), Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA) and other relevant
government agencies such as National Board of Revenue (NBR). The proposed FSC would be led by the
Finance Minister. Countries such as India and the United States of America had setup similar councils in
the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. While the exact terms of reference of the council has
yet to be determined, the structure being reported for Bangladesh is like the one in India.
Considering the excess liquidity in the banking sector and the rise in per capita income in Bangladesh, BB
has also revised the upper ceiling of personal credit cards and loans. Under the revised guidelines unsecured
limit has been doubled for both the sectors to Tk 1 million and Tk 2 million. Bangladesh Bank has also
revised the maximum interest rate that banks will be allowed to charge for credit card holders. Under the
new guidelines, the interest rate on the outstanding amount of credit cards shall not exceed 5 percent of the
highest interest rate offered on any credits of the bank.

Trade and Investment: Bangladesh has attempted to move forward with an ambitious program to improve
its rankings in the Doing Business Index and increase the flow of FDI. Initiatives have also been taken to
improve trade arrangements with other developing countries.
Bangladesh ranked 176 amongst 188 countries in the latest Doing Business Index. To enhance Bangladesh’s
ranking, the cabinet has approved ‘One-stop Service Act, 2017’. This law would facilitate and expedite
domestic and foreign investors in getting 16 types of services. These include the issuance of trade license,
land registration and mutation, environmental clearance, construction permit, connections of power, gas
and water, telephone and internet, explosive license and boiler certificate. Four organizations under the
Prime Minister’s Office namely, Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), Bangladesh
Economic Zone Authority (BEZA), Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority (BEPZA) and
Bangladesh Hi-tech Park Authority, would act as the 'Central One-stop Service Authority’ in their
respective areas.
To facilitate trade with India, Bangladesh has taken on a program to improve the infrastructure of three land
ports. The development of these land ports will help to ease the pressure on Benapole which remains the
single largest land port in the country. The government has also decided to keep both the Benapole land
port as well as the Chittagong sea port open 24 hours a day and seven days’ a week. There has been growing
concern over the congestion at these two crucial ports and this is an attempt to facilitate faster clearance of
both export and import commodities.
The government approved a proposal for the ratification of the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) signed
among eight Muslim countries of the D-8 alliance. The eight countries comprising the Developing-8 (D-8)
are Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Nigeria. Bangladesh had not
ratified the agreement signed in 2006 due to a dispute over the value addition criterion. Apart from
Bangladesh, the other members of the bloc decided that at least 40 percent local value addition will be
required to enjoy preferential tariffs for goods of member-states under the treaty. Bangladesh, being a least
developed country or LDC, demanded the tariff preference for its goods against 30 percent local value
addition in the rules of origin (RoO) in the intra-forum trade. The D-8 PTA came into force for Iran,
Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey from last year.
Infrastructure: Limited progress across all major infrastructure projects.
While government had planned to complete at least three mega infrastructure projects by the end of its
current tenure, all projects are now lagging far behind their schedule barring the Padma Bridge project.
Padma Bridge project has reportedly made significant progress with about 45 percent of work already being
completed and is expected to be operational by December 2018. The progress of the phase-1 of the Metro
Rail project has been slow with only 4 percent of the work being completed. The project got delayed after
the Holey Artisan terrorist attack last year. The project is being funded by JICA. Another JICA project, the
Matabari Coal power plant, has also seen delays and only 1 percent of the work has been completed.
Similarly, there has been limited progress with the coal fired Rampal Power Plant where only the land
development work has been completed. The construction work of the country’s first nuclear power plant
will start from September this year after the government completed all the financing agreement with the
Russian Federation. The plant will be entirely financed through a Russian line of credit worth US$ 11.3
billion with a repayment period of 20 years.
The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has finalized the guidelines for the
upcoming 4G spectrum auction. BTRC is also expected to approve technology neutrality for all existing
spectrum, which operators have been calling for and some are already prepared to upgrade their networks
to 4G. The telecom operators want the technology neutrality to be implemented beforehand, rather than
announcing 4G auction to ensure quality services. Introduction of 4G services will complement the
government’s Digital Bangladesh agenda and will also play a crucial role in realizing the government’s
non-tax revenue target for FY18.

Energy: Bangladesh diversifies into LNG.
The government has given approval to build three floating LNG terminals. The terminals would be in Cox’s
Bazaar which has an ideal infrastructure for the setup of an LNG terminal. All floating terminals would
have daily generation capacities of 500 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD). Reliance of India, Manjala
Power Limited of Hong Kong and a joint venture between US based Excelerate Energy and local Summit
Group will build the three terminals. To complement the development of the floating terminals, the
government has also planned to blend the imported re-gasified LNG (R-LNG) with locally produced gas
before supplying to consumers. Natural gas supply is set to increase by around 1,000 million cubic feet per
day (mmcfd) from 2018 due to this initiative. 500 mmcfd of the imported LNG will be added to the national
gas grid by the first half of 2018, while another 500 mmcfd in the second half. This would help to address
the natural gas shortage in Bangladesh.

Overall Progress in the Labor Market
Leveraging labor – the most important asset of the poor – to generate an earnings stream is the most sustainable way
out of poverty for individuals and households. A multi-sectoral Jobs Diagnostic jointly conducted by the World Bank
and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) recently assessed the supply and demand sides of Bangladesh’s labor
market in terms of job creation, quality, and inclusiveness. The diagnostic used multiple sources of data including the
Economic Census and various years of Labor Force Surveys (LFS) during the period between 2003 and 2016, and
provided a comprehensive analysis of the economy with the jobs lens. The analysis documented impressive
developments over the past decade, but also highlighted several entrenched and emerging challenges in the labor
market that will require concerted efforts for policy and institutional intervention.


Economic growth, along with a favorable demographic transition, has translated into substantial
progress in jobs outcomes (Figure 15). Between 2003 and 2016 the conomy generated more than 1.15

percent annually over this period
Trade integration, through exports in the ready-made garments (RMG) sector, has been a critical
catalyst of job-creating industrialization and urbanization. The export-oriented RMG sector, based
mostly in mega-cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong, has grown rapidly and contributed to large-scale job
creation during the 2000s. Data on trades show that exports, 89 percent of which come from the RMG
sector, grew by more than 16 percent annually between 2003 and 2015 (double that global average rate),
contributing to a tripling of the export share of GDP over that period (Figure 16, left). Thus, jobs in the
RMG expanded from 600,000 in 2003 to over 3.2 million by 2010. Driven by RMG’s performance, the
manufacturing sector accounted for more than one-quarter of net employment between 2003 and 2016.

Despite impressive labor market performance with steady structural transformation and robust
productivity growth, there are multiple challenges that require policy attention.
The pace of job creation has fallen sharply in recent years. Employment grew at a rapid annual rate of
3.1 percent in 2003-10, allowing for lower unemployment and higher labor force participation. But these
trends were reversed in 2010-16, with jobs growth falling to just 1.8 percent annually (Figure 17). This
slowdown in employment in 2010-16 took place despite accelerated economic growth (annual per capita
growth rate at 5.2 percent in 2010-16 compared to 4.5 percent in 2003-10). One major factor contributing
to the slowdown was stagnating jobs growth in the RMG sector, with the average number of jobs added per
year in the RMG and textiles sectors declining from over 300,000 in 2003-10 to only around 60,000 since
2010 (Figure 18). This slowdown in jobs growth in RMG sector is likely to have contributed to the
stagnating female labor force participation (LFP) rate since 2010.

Slowdown in the RMG sector underscores the need to develop a more diversified export sector. While
other manufacturing sectors are growing rapidly to meet the increasing domestic demand, export oriented
sectors beyond RMG need to emerge to create quality jobs on a large scale. Sectors like footwear, leather
products, and pharmaceuticals have improved their export performance and shown potential for growth,
but have not been emerging quickly enough as a source of exports and job creation. This is in part due to
an investment policy environment that favors established sectors like RMG, underscoring the need to
enhance competitiveness of sectors beyond RMG.
Sluggish enterprise growth and a high share of
microenterprises highlights the need to support an          Figure 19: Distribution of economic units, by type

the RMG sector, permanent microenterprises, along
with     household     enterprises      and    temporary
establishments, account for 98 percent of all economic
units in the country and half of all jobs (Figure 19).
Most microenterprises exist to offer subsistence
earnings in the absence of formal, wage jobs, and are
not positioned for growth. Thus, Bangladeshi firms tend
to be micro and old, failing to either grow or exit. What
is missing is growth and job creation from small and           Permanent -                         Temporary
mid-sized enterprises. Both regulatory barriers and          microenterprises                    establishments,

access to finance constrain the ability of micro-
enterprises to improve earnings and to grow.
Job creation prospects also depend on addressing major urban infrastructure gaps. While Dhaka
division is now home to around 30 percent of Bangladesh’s population, it accounts for 45 percent of all
industry jobs and 37 percent of all services jobs. Congestion is becoming a major constraint to firm
productivity and expansion, and firms are forced to shift to the urban periphery. This is clear from the
declining urban share of firms, especially large ones. New investments and expansions in all parts of the
country (but especially Dhaka) are constrained by lack of access to land. Yet outside Dhaka (and to some
degree Chittagong), second-tier cities are not emerging as alternative locations for industrial investment.
This is due to similar land constraints, but also to shortfalls in the critical physical infrastructure such as
transport and electricity, and to gaps in healthcare and education service delivery, which act as barriers to

attracting skilled workers. Improved infrastructure in cities would likely increase incentives to migrate from
rural to urban areas, which can facilitate access to formal wage employment.
In addition to job creation, significant improvement in the quality of jobs must be a high priority.
Substantial shares of workers are engaged in informal, unpaid, or agricultural work -- Only 22 percent of
male and 20 percent of female workers are wage employees and agriculture is still the largest sector with
respect to employment. A higher share of working females are employed in agriculture than men, while
women’s presence in services is far less than men (Figure 20). The share of unpaid workers, close to 40
percent for women and 5 percent for men, also highlights the gender discrepancy in job quality, although
women are far less likely to work as day laborers. Informality, even among wage employees, is also
commonplace, with less than 40 percent of wage employees having a written contract, let alone access to
social insurance such as pensions. Significant gender gaps remain in LFP, employment status, as well sector
of work and occupation, with a higher gender gap in LFP in urban areas but a larger gap in access to wage

Low levels of technology outdated management practices, and lagging skills of the workforce
especially among microenterprises, perpetuate the creation of low quality jobs. Firms tend to lack
knowledge and technology for competitiveness, but face financial constraints to make investments in
productivity-enhancing technology and practices. Moreover, despite rapid increases in formal education,
particularly for females, the Bangladeshi work force, has limited opportunities to develop labor market
relevant skills. The result is that most workers are stuck in low productivity jobs, while high productivity
industries struggle to find competent employees, particularly in technical and management levels, and often
outsource foreign workers.
In the midst of slowing job creation and low quality of jobs, access to jobs for vulnerable groups is
becoming increasing challenging, threatening inclusiveness of the labor market. In recent years, youth
unemployment rates, particularly for females, have spiked while those of older adults remain relatively
stable, suggesting that youth may be disproportionally affected by the pressures associated with the recent
slow-down in job creation (Figure 21). Poorly functioning Technical and Vocational Education and
Training (TVET) systems and lack of intermediation or employment services, combined with entrenched
inefficiencies in the functioning of labor markets, likely hinders women and youth from accessing job
opportunities. School-to-work transitions continue to be a challenge as relatively better educated young
workers tend to remain unemployed.

International migration will continue to be a critical channel for employment, and can be more
effectively managed to deliver quality, inclusive jobs. More than half a million Bangladeshis a year have
migrated abroad temporarily over the past decade, including significant share of women (16 percent of all
out-migrants in 2016). However, significant challenges exist. Migration costs for Bangladeshis are among
the highest in the world, and are often the source of heavy indebtedness and overstay of migrant workers.
International employment is highly concentrated both in terms of markets (a select few receiving countries,
mainly in the Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC, countries) and sectors (construction for males and domestic
work for females), highlighting the need for diversification of skills and destination markets as well as
worker protection. Migrant workers are often vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to variation in the
provision and protections of rights and conditions of work in receiving countries. Moreover, irregular
migration flows to high-income destinations are rising, raising the risk of forced repatriation in the future.

Outlook, Risks and Policy Challenges
The growth drivers in Bangladesh are likely to benefit from the improved global outlook. Exports and remittances
are projected to recover to still below their historic double digit averages. This together with the damages caused by
floods to agricultural output and infrastructure will drag growth down in FY18 to 6.4 percent followed by a rise back
to 6.7 percent in FY19. Inflation is likely to increase due to overheating resulting from the excess of actual growth
over the potential growth rate and adverse supply shocks. But prudent monetary policy is expected to keep inflation
bearable. External current account deficit will persist, making exchange rate flexibility more important. Budget deficit
will rise and not just because of election pressure on public expenditures and revenue mobilization. The public debt
to GDP ratio is projected to rise as well, but remain below levels that may start worrying the creditors. Downside
risks include the resurgence of political instability in the run up to elections in early 2019 and a hardening of credit
constraints with increased insolvency of banks due to rising NPLs. Excess liquidity and reduction in fiscal space
through cost inefficient domestic financing of budget deficit present latent risks.

The recovery in global growth, underway since mid-2016, is expected to continue.12 Global
manufacturing activity and trade have firmed, financing conditions remain benign, and commodity prices
have stabilized. From a post-crisis low of 2.4 percent in 2016, global growth is expected to increase to 2.7
percent in 2017 and 2.9 percent 2018, mainly driven by stronger growth in Emerging Market and
Developing Economies (EMDE) as obstacles to activity among commodity exporters gradually diminish.
Growth in advanced economies - Bangladesh’s major export markets - is projected to recover modestly to
1.9 percent in 2017 (from 1.7 percent in 2016), and to stabilize at 1.8 percent in 2018. The improvement
reflects an investment-led recovery in the advanced economies combined with receding obstacles to activity
among commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Following two years
of near stagnation, activity in commodity-exporting EMDEs appears poised to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017
and 2.7 percent in 2018. However, in most of these countries, growth will remain significantly lower than
pre-crisis and long-term averages. The adjustment to low commodity prices has proven more protracted
than initially expected. Consequently, growth in the Middle East, where the bulk of Bangladeshi migrant
workers make their living, is expected to slow as adjustments to low oil prices continue through oil
production cuts and protracted fiscal consolidation.
However, policy uncertainty has increased. Escalating trade restrictions from major economies could
derail the rebound in global trade. EMDEs remain particularly vulnerable to this risk, as many of them rely
on trade as an engine for growth and development. Moreover, persistent policy uncertainty could dampen
confidence and investment. In addition, a sudden market reassessment of policy-related or geopolitical risks
could trigger financial market turbulence. A re-pricing of risk and abrupt changes in financing conditions
could contribute to wide movements in capital flows to EMDEs, potentially amplifying vulnerabilities in
some countries.

Poverty reduction in Bangladesh will continue to be underpinned by robust growth propelled by
poverty reducing drivers. Output growth in FY18 is expected to be robust at around 6.4 percent, driven
by industry and services (Table-8). This is slower than last year because growth in FY17 is overestimated
due to undercounting of losses in agriculture and services caused by floods, among others, and some of the
windfalls, such as the large pay increases in the public and related sectors, that boosted services growth in
FY17 have tapered off. Exports are projected to grow faster with recovery in global trade, a 4.2 percent
depreciation of the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) since January through July 2017, and extension
of cash incentives to new exports by the government; remittances may turnaround a bit as remittances from
recently increased number of Bangladeshi workers abroad begin to take effect; and private investments may
pick up in response to lower interest rates and improvements in trade logistics infrastructure. These are
projected to contribute to a rise in growth to 6.7 percent in FY19. Recovery in exports and remittances
would help buttress the impact of growth on poverty reduction.

Strategic export target continues to rely on RMG. The Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) is expecting
exports to hit US37.5 billion in FY18
which means that exports would need to
grow at 8.3 percent. The RMG sector is               Figure 22: Monthly Export Growth (y-o-y, %)

 15.8 percent relative to July-August 2016 (Figure-23).
 Floods will have adverse impact on production in the first half of FY18 but could contribute to higher
 productivity in its aftermath. The impact of floods on agriculture in Bangladesh is mixed: although severe
 inundation destroys crops in the monsoon flood months, monsoon floods act as an open-access resource in
 supplying irrigational input to agriculture. While yield rates decline when floods assume “extreme”
 proportions, productivity increases during “normal” floods and in the post -flood months.13 A loss of crops
 in the flood months is more than compensated by a bumper production of post-flood crops.
 Macroeconomic stability is likely to be challenged. Inflation is projected to increase as global commodity
 prices pick up combined with an expansionary fiscal policy and supply disruptions due to natural calamity.
 With actual output exceeding the potential in FY17 (Table-7), the economy is also beginning to overheat.
 Bangladesh will continue to rely on exports and remittances for growth and remain exposed to global
 uncertainties and external shocks. At the current real exchange rate, investment-related imports combined
 with low single digit export and remittance growth could be expected to keep the current account in deficit
 over the medium-term as well. For the first time in last 16 years, the overall balance of payment in July
 2017 recorded a $179 million deficit, compared with $480 million surplus in July, 2016. 14 It is therefore
 essential that exchange rate management maintains the country’s foreign exchange reserves sufficient to
 ensure the economy’s resilience. But even modestly weaker-than-projected remittances growth, export
 demand, or commodity prices could reduce coverage considerably. As in previous years, the budget is based
 on overly ambitious projections for revenue growth and correspondingly ambitious capital spending targets, with
 the realized shortfalls for both likely to offset each other to some extent. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is
 projected to increase but remain below 40 percent of GDP. This favorable debt outlook is sensitive to the
 assumption of continued robust growth and revenue gains. Despite shortfall in revenue, fiscal deficit could
 be below the 5 percent budget target if expenditure adjustments beyond the usual implementation shortfall
 are made.

 Downside risks are primarily domestic. The downside risks to the outlook include a revival of political
 unrest in the run up to elections, a protracted slowdown in key export markets (particularly the EU and US),

   A 47 percent increase in imports, driven by food, capital machinery and raw cotton, resulted in $497 million deficit
 in the current account despite 18.5 percent export and 11 percent remittance growth in July, 2017. The financial
 account surplus fell short of the current account deficit by $4 million which added to the $175 million outflow in the
 “errors and omissions” account resulted in the $17 9 overall BOP deficit.

a further weakening of remittances, and a weakening of corporate governance in the banking system.
Excess liquidity and reduction of fiscal space through recourse to expensive sources of deficit financing
present latent risk to macroeconomic stability. However, slower deposit growth resulting from negative real
deposit rates combined with a pickup in domestic credit growth could dry out excess liquidity. At the same
time export demand and remittances could surprise on the upside. This calls for the Bangladesh Bank to
continue its flexible approach to exchange rate management, actively allowing the level of the nominal rate
to adjust— as it has recently—as needed to preserve reserve buffers. More generally, the exchange rate
should be the main tool to buffer the domestic economy against sustained external shocks, both positive
and negative. If the current account prospects were to turn out stronger than expected for reasons that could
be persistent, such as greater-than-expected export demand or remittance inflows, the nominal exchange
rate should be allowed to appreciate. But if foreign exchange inflows are the result of temporary shocks,
the BB would be justified in intervening to maintain the nominal peg.

Bangladesh’s near and medium-term policy challenges remain formidable. Investment needs are large,
both for increasing productivity and employment. Bangladesh must take advantage of the global recovery
to undertake institutional and market reforms that can attract domestic and foreign private investment as
well as stimulate innovative activities to help sustain growth in the long term. The macroeconomic policy-
making practices and institutions will need upgrading to maintain the economy’s past growth performance.
Comprehensive and well-coordinated policy efforts are required increasing the pace of job creation; raising
the quality of jobs: to ensure that labor markets deliver shared prosperity for all parts of Bangladeshi society
by connecting vulnerable groups to jobs.
Approximately 13 percent of people still live in extreme poverty (preliminary official quarterly estimates
April-June, 2016) and about half of the population are vulnerable to falling back into poverty. Moving
forward in the near term, a key challenge is to accelerate the reform momentum while stemming reversals
as seen recently in the case of the financial sector (Banking Companies Act) and taxation (VAT Law).
Given the mounting risks ahead as election gets closer, a promising policy strategy is to take advantage of
the prevailing tailwinds (low international commodity prices, comfortable foreign exchange reserves) to
build greater economic resilience nationally. This means rebalancing policy towards structural reforms
raising the economy’s jobs potential.
Maintaining the economy’s past growth performance will require upgrading the macroeconomic
policy-making practices and institutions. The monetary policy stance should be adjusted as needed to
keep inflation broadly stable. Broad money and credit growth are currently consistent with this objective,
but the Bangladesh Bank should be prepared to tighten its stance if credit growth begins to accelerate. It is
essential to preserve foreign exchange reserves buffers to ensure resilience to external shocks. The exchange
rate need to be managed flexibly as needed to accomplish this.
Bangladesh Bank took a more cautious and realistic approach in its Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) for
H1 of FY18. It kept the repo and the reverse repo unchanged at 6.75 percent and 4.75 percent respectively.
BB has considered the need to keep inflation within the budgetary target of 5.5 percent. Inflation had
reached 5.94 percent at the end of the fiscal year, before declining to 5.57 percent in July. When compared
to July last year, this still represents 0.17 percentage points increase. Furthermore, the recent floods in the
northern region of Bangladesh may increase rice prices which will put upward pressure on inflation.
Bangladesh Bank is also targeting a 13.9 percent broad money growth with a 16.2 percent growth in private
sector credit. The broad money growth target accommodates the projected 13.3 percent nominal GDP
growth in FY18. BB is also targeting a 12.1 percent growth in public sector credit and an overall domestic
credit growth of 15.8 percent. This is well above the 11.6 percent domestic credit growth achieved in FY17.
Prudent fiscal policy has kept public debt moderate, but reform slippage has added new challenges.
Raising public investment and social spending to levels consistent with the government’s growth ambitions
without compromising fiscal sustainability will require boosting Bangladesh’s low budget revenue and

                                                                                                             29
modernizing the tax system. The new VAT law would have been central to this effort, and a successful
launch in July 2017 could have been an important signal that the government is determined to persevere
with needed structural reforms. Beyond its direct revenue benefits (estimated at 1 percent of GDP per year),
the law could also have improved compliance and reduce tax evasion across the board while serving as a
key building block for future tax policy reforms. As a next step, there is considerable scope to broaden the
direct tax base through a modern Direct Tax Code. Postponement of the implementation of the VAT Law
requires significant early adjustments in the FY18 Budget to tap additional sources of revenue and
expenditure saving to increase fiscal space (see below).
More than usual adjustments will be needed to maintain fiscal prudence. The FY18 Budget needs to
be revisited in response to an estimated Tk 200 billion shortfall in revenue due to the postponement of the
implementation of the new VAT law. Although public expenditure will also be lower than target due to
the usual implementation shortfall, budget deficit may still rise and its financing mix may need some
redesigning. Coping with the revenue shortfall would require additional revenue effort as well as tightening
of expenditures in FY18. In this context, the Finance Minister’s decision to revise the FY18 Budget earlier
than usual is a step in the right direction.
Several challenges loom large. Responding to weak aggregate demand due to weak export growth and
large remittance decline warrants some fiscal stimulus. Such a fiscal expansion must be driven by
investment and inclusion expenditures. Incentivizing and strengthening systems for implementation
requires deep business process reforms in the development administration and the regulatory institutions
(Box-2). Stopping leakages and improving targeting in the social protection programs requires diligent
pursuit of reforms envisaged in the government’s National Social Security Strategy (NSSS). Addressing
financial sector insolvency through massive reforms in corporate governance will be critical. Mitigating
weaknesses in jobs growth is another major challenge requiring fast track reforms on ease and cost of doing
business while improving the quality and coverage of infrastructure and energy.

                               Box 2: Doing Business Reforms in Bangladesh

 Bangladesh’s has traditionally performed poorly on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking. The newly
 formed Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) has taken on an ambitious reform program that
 will attempt to improve Bangladesh’s DTF score and help to move the country to the sub -100 category. These
 reforms include bringing down the time for completion of process for starting business to seven days from 19.5
 days. The package also eyes cutting time for giving construction permits to 60 days from 278 days and electricity
 to 28 days from the present 404 days. BIDA’s mid-year update claims they have been successful in pushing RAJUK
 to bring down the issuance of land use clearance certificate to 15 days from 30 days; special project permission
 certificate has been reduced to 15 days from 45 days and electricity connection can now be availed within 15 days
 of submitting all the necessary paperwork.

 While these changes represent a more behavioral change, the government has also decided to update the regulatory
 framework to achieve this target. The cabinet recently approved the One Stop Service Act which aims to provide
 quick services from a single window to potential investors. NBR is awaiting Parliamentary approval for the new
 Customs Act and they are also in the process of automating all the customs data and creating a national single
 window.

 While these are truly impressive steps in the right direction, the proof of the pudding is always in the eating. BIDA
 should continue to remain attentive to achieve its overall objective. BIDA as the coordinating agency must continue
 to push the different agencies concerned to adapt the targets that they had set for themselves.




                                                                                                                    30
A policy agenda for more, better, inclusive jobs. Comprehensive and well-coordinated policy efforts are
required aimed at improving (i) macro and business environment; (ii) regional and sectoral policies; and
(iii) labor market and skills. These areas of priority are line with the Vision 2021 and 7th Five-Year Plan of
the Government of Bangladesh (GoB). Such policy efforts would cover three inter-linked objectives:
•   Increasing the pace of job creation: to deliver large-scale job creation that will absorb a growing labor
    force;
•   Raising the quality of jobs: to increase earnings, employment stability, working conditions, and
    formality
•   Connecting vulnerable groups to jobs: to ensure that labor markets deliver shared prosperity for all
    parts of Bangladeshi society.

Faster, diversified job creation
Regulatory reform and revisiting distortionary industrial policies will be critical for accelerating
structural transformation and improving competitiveness, especially for non-RMG sectors and for
SMEs. For the non-RMG sectors, policy reforms that level the playing field with currently favored sectors
like RMG will be necessary to enhance competitiveness and attract new investments, and could include
measures like standardizing the tax and subsidy regime and extending special customs and financing
facilities to all sectors. Trade and investment climate reform will also be important to remove restrictive
distortions. Removal of para-tariffs and non-tariff measures/non-tariff barriers (NTMs/NTBs) could help
firms have easier access to higher quality and more competitively priced inputs. In parallel, interventions
that streamline business licensing and permitting procedures will benefit entry and growth of all firms, and
targeted efforts are needed to support micro/household enterprises for job creation especially in the non-
agricultural rural economy. Similarly, reforms to improve contract and insolvency enforcement in the court
system will be particularly critical to support the SME expansion.
Better planned and faster urbanization, critical for the development of second-tier cities and the
sustainability of Dhaka, will need strategic and coordinated investments in amenities, infrastructure,
and administrative capacity. At the national level, Special Economic Zones to facilitate access to
industrial land more broadly, by freeing up (and packaging) substantial government-owned land, and
institutional reforms such as consolidating the administrative structures that govern industrial land use,
could be implemented. A national perspective will also be required to coordinate interventions across the
country’s large cities and their City Corporations, to develop and implement integrated urban (metropolitan)
development plans that address issues of infrastructure, land, and transport systems. In parallel, at the local
level, the various City Corporations – beyond those of Dhaka and Chittagong – could take an initiative to
carry out development planning and implementing public investment.
Improved job quality
Increasing the level of formality of the labor market will contribute substantially to enhancing the
quality of jobs, but it will need to be supported by interventions that boost firm productivity.
Productivity growth is already challenged by infrastructure and business climate constraints. However,
these constraints are amplified by poor management practices and skills gaps in the labor supply. Low and
slow-growing firm productivity is also explained by a combination of challenges including financing
constraints and lack of knowledge. An important set of interventions to encourage productivity growth
would thus be reforms to the standards regime to promote adoption of improved standards and technologies.
Facilitating migration from rural areas to urban centers, if measures for planned urbanization are taken
simultaneously, may also be a policy option to facilitate access to better jobs and increase earnings
opportunities.
Developing a policy to enable workers in the informal sector have access to benefits and social
insurance would also enhance job quality. For instance, many workers have no access to pensions as the

                                                                                                            31
current pension system, consisting of the poverty targeted social pension (Old Age Allowance) and the
Pension for Retired Government Employees and their Families a mandatory pension for government
retirees, is insufficient as most workers are excluded. As Bangladesh continues the process of demographic
transition, the importance of old age support will eventually become politically and socially pressing. The
GoB thus needs to develop an overarching strategy or policy that expands coverage, while remaining
sustainable. It could include reforms of government retiree pensions, reforms of social pensions,
introduction of various schemes (e.g. voluntary, contributory savings), and possible mandatory pensions
for the private formal sector.
Access to jobs for vulnerable groups
Given the growing importance of migration for development, there are several interventions that the
GoB can make to facilitate more and safer temporary migration of workers . At the government to
government (G2G) level, the GoB can expand the set of countries with which there are MoUs and bilateral
labor agreements. These agreements would reduce migration costs while also reducing the vulnerability of
migrant workers overseas, particularly of female migrants that have been recently sharply rising in numbers.
The vulnerability can be further reduced, by developing policies to facilitate return and reintegration, which
may be especially important for migrant workers concentrated in economies exposed to commodity price
volatility or other macro-economic shocks like regional conflict. Bangladesh has already taken several
important steps in recent years through legislation (e.g., the Overseas Employment and Migrants Act 2013
and Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment Policies 2016), and efforts should be made to ensure
their implementation capacity.
Youth and women represent the other vulnerable groups that may need policy support to improve
access to jobs, and the policy interventions for them will need to be holistic. Unemployment rates
among youth and females are rising in Bangladesh, yet there have been limited efforts for counseling, job
search assistance, or intermediation services. The training opportunities and services that are available, have
proven to be insufficient and/or ineffective. As a prerequisite to deep interventions, Bangladesh may benefit
from a workforce development strategy to identify strategic areas of investment to ensure linkage of jobs
and workers. A measure that is likely to emerge from such a strategy, and that could even be taken in
parallel, is reform of the Technical Training Center system to reduce fragmentation and improve quality of
services so the system fulfills its goals.
