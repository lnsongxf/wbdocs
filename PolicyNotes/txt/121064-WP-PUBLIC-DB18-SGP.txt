About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

  3   Obtain written permission from the Urban Redevelopment Authority                   14 days                 SGD 2,680
      Agency : Urban Redevelopment Authority

      The application for permission from the Urban Redevelopment Authority
      (URA) can be done electronically by a Quali ed Professional (QP) through the
      CORENET Electronic Development Applications (EDA) system. The company
      must submit a digital EDA form, along with the following:
      • Proposal and sketch plans for the development
      • Survey plans for sloping or undulating sites

      Companies can apply to URA via two schemes: Normal and Plan Lodgment
      Scheme. Launched in 1995, the Plan Lodgment Scheme allows for projects
      that ful ll the qualifying criteria (see http://www.ura.gov.sg/dc/lodgment/dc-
      lodgment-hdb_jtc.htm) to be submitted and approved online immediately.
      The application is made either through JTC system or through URA's EDA
      system. The fees for a plan lodgment are SGD 800.00 plus 7% GST. The Plan
      Lodgment Scheme is applicable to industrial and warehouse development
      on land owned by JTC and the HDB, which forms about 90% of industrial land
      in Singapore. All Quali ed Persons (i.e. Architects or Engineers) are allowed
      to submit their development proposals under the Plan Lodgment Scheme.
      There is no restriction on the size or type of the industrial developments or
      the QP’s rms. In 2007, nearly 70% (562 out of 830) of the industrial and
      warehouse development proposals were eligible for approval under the Plan
      Lodgment Scheme. However, if the land is not under either JTC or Housing
      and Development Board scheme (HDB is for residential developments), and
      under freehold ownership the application would go through a normal
      clearance process.


      Although the application submitted under the normal scheme itself takes 1
      day, it takes on average about 14 days for the URA to process it and grant
      permission. URA does not have a time limit, but rather operates under a
      targeted threshold. According to that target 90% of cases must be cleared in
      4 weeks. The written permission is valid for 2 years, during which time the
      work must be completed.

      The application fee for normal process is SGD 2,500.00 for the rst 1,000 sq.
      m. and SGD 60.00 for each additional 100 sq. m. (plus 7% general service tax
      which is not included in the case study).

      The case considered here assumes a commercial warehouse for storing                                                         Page 13

       Quali ed Professionals submit the structural plans through CORENET
       system operated by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). The
       permit will not be issued without the written or provisional permission from
       the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and payment of any development
       charges, if applicable. Most companies submit their application to URA and
       BCA for structural approval at the same time. They can time it in a way that
       the structural approval is granted a day after the URA issues planning

      the structural approval is granted a day after the URA issues planning
      permission. Construction work must commence within 24 months from the
      approval date.


      The structural plan approval can be granted along with the building
      commencement permit that gives the right to physically begin the
      construction.


      Since 2008 the BCA runs a data management module in its application
      processing system to monitor its performance standard. It also introduced
      mobile phone short message and e-mail noti cation to inform the applicants
      of their applications status instantaneously.


      Since September 1, 2005, the fee schedule is as follows:
      • SGD 300.00 per 100 sq. m. for the rst 2,500 sq. m. of standard gross oor
      area (SGFA)
      • SGD 200.00 for each subsequent 100 sq. m. of SGFA


      Hence, in this case, the total fee charged for 1,300 sq. m. is 13 x SGD 300.00 =
      SGD 3,900.00

      Before March 2010, the Workplace Safety & Health (Registration of Factories)
      Regulations required all factories engaged in higher risk activities including
      construction worksites, shipyards, metalworking companies, wafer
      fabrication, petrochemical, chemical and pharmaceutical plants to be
      registered before they can commence operations. Registration was valid for
      only one year. An annual fee depending on the number of persons employed
      at the premise ranging from SGD 90 (5 or less workers in premise) to SGD
      2340 (more than 500 workers in premise) was payable upon registration and
      renewal.


      Ministry of Manpower has reviewed the factory registration system for
      higher risk factories which includes construction worksites and introduced a
      new one-time registration scheme. From 1 March 2010, factories in the
      Building and Construction are amongst those which bene t from the new
      scheme. All factories under this scheme are required to register and pay
      once for their license with the Ministry without the need to renew their
      license.

      Qualifying factories were only required to do two things prior to the

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      The customer has to engage and appoint an Electrical Worker licensed (LEW)
      with the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to design the internal electrical
      installation, a LEW for the electrical installation works, and a LEW to operate
      on the installation. The client can appoint the same LEW for all three duties.
      The LEW essentially acts as the client's agent for the connection to the grid
      system.

      There are three classes of LEWs, namely licensed electricians (load < 45kVA),
      licensed electrical technicians (load design < 150kVA) and licensed electrical
      engineers (no limit on load). Based on the case study's load (140kVA), the
      customer needs to appoint either a licensed electrical technician or licensed
      electrical engineer.


      The appointed LEW submits an application to SP Services Ltd to connect to
      the grid system, along with 2 copies of the site plan. SP Services Ltd advises
      the appointed LEW on the approval of the application and provides them
      with a quotation for the premises to receive service connection from the
      streets mains.

      SP Services Ltd serves as a one-stop customer center for electricity
      connections. It receives electricity supply applications, payment of
      connection fees, opens electricity accounts and makes turn-on appointment
      with customers. Direct service connection from SP PowerGrid's LV network
      to the client's installation is available for a small load requirement not
      exceeding 280kVA (400A) in commercial or industrial areas.

      Once SP Power Group o ers the terms and conditions of the connection, SP
      Services will liaise with the LEW so he/she can open an account and pay the
      connection fee - which are done on the same day. The external works from
      SP PowerGrid Ltd commence automatically upon payment of the connection
      fee. No further action is required from the customer.

      The documents required for opening of account are:

       For the warehouse, a direct connection is applicable as the applied load is
       140 kVA. Services for the provision of electricity supply from the existing
       overground box to the industrial premises with load demand between 76
       kVA and 140 kVA will be managed as follows by SP Services Ltd and SP
       PowerGrid Ltd:

       a. Upon receipt of the connection fee payment by SP Services Ltd, SP
       PowerGrid Ltd will commence work and inform the appointed LEW and the
       client about the date for xing meter and turn-on of electricity supply. The
       customer’s appointed LEW has to submit the document required for turn-on
       of supply before the turn-on date.


       b. The service provided is underground. An excavation permit is thus needed
       before SP PowerGrid Ltd can start laying cables. For pragmatic reasons, SP
       PowerGrid will only apply for the permit after the client has made the
       connection fee payment and had their intake point ready for connection. SP
       PowerGrid Ltd works closely with the agencies to have the road openings
       approved within 7 calendar days and then commence the physical cable
       installation work;

       c. SP PowerGrid Ltd will carry out meter xing once the cable installation
       work is started;

       d. The service cable will be energised on the next day after the cable
       installation work is completed -- provided that a certi cate of compliance
       (COC) has been lodged.

   3   Obtain electrical installation license                                            2 calendar days    SGD 100

       The appointed licensed electrical worker (LEW) obtains an electrical
       installation license from the Energy Market Authority (EMA) on behalf of the
       customer. Indeed, for safety reasons, an electrical installation license issued
       by EMA is required for the use or operation of an electrical installation with
       an approved load exceeding 45kVA in a non-domestic premises.
                                                                                                                            Page 24

       Agency : Energy Market Authority (EMA)

       The appointed licensed electrical worker (LEW) obtains an electrical
       installation license from the Energy Market Authority (EMA) on behalf of the
       customer. Indeed, for safety reasons, an electrical installation license issued
       by EMA is required for the use or operation of an electrical installation with
       an approved load exceeding 45kVA in a non-domestic premises.

       The customer has to engage and appoint a LEW who will inspect and certify
       the tness of the electrical installation. Thereafter the LEW will submit an
       application for the electrical installation license online through the EMA's
       ELISE portal at www.ema.gov.sg. The license fee of SGD100/= (for a 12-month
       license) is to be paid online together with the application. The EMA will check
       the completeness of the application before issuing the electrical installation
       license.

       The application for the license may be submitted in advance of the electricity
       supply connection date.

   4   Submit installation license and COC to SP PowerGrid Ltd to have                   1 calendar day        SGD 0
       electricity turned on
       Agency : SP Services Ltd

       The customer’s appointed LEW needs to submit to SP Services Ltd the
       following documents to con rm the turn-on appointment:

       - Certi cate of Compliance (COC) issued by the appointed LEW certifying that
       the (internal) electrical work is conforming to the requirements of the
       Electricity Regulations and the relevant Singapore Standard Code of Practice;
       and

       - A copy of valid electrical installation licence obtained from the Energy
       Market Authority (EMA).

       Both documents are typically submitted to SP Services Ltd right before the
       electricity turn-on and not when the electricity account and connection fees
       are paid.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees
                                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)             - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                       commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)                                                                                  Page 52  
                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.

                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                               - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                 - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                       movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.
