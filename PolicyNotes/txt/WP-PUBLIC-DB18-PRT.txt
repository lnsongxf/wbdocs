About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                     There are two ways of starting a business in Portugal:

                     1) "On the Spot Firm" (Empresa na Hora). This is currently the most common
                     way to register a business. This service enables to set up a company in less
                     than an hour at a single contact point.
                     As long as the partners have all of necessary documents, the company is set
                     up immediately at one of the desks of the On the Spot Firm o ces, available
                     throughout the country, regardless of the location of the company’s
                     headquarters.


                     The rst step is to choose a name from the list of pre-approved names
                     available at the website On the Spot Firm or to submit a name of its choice to
                     the RNPC, which will issue a company's name certi cate. This certi cate of

                     only once. If the name of the company is composed by the name of its
                     shareholders, it may now be approved at the moment of incorporation of
                     the company at the one-stop shop.


                     Then entrepreneurs need to choose one of the pre-approved standard

        There are two ways of starting a business in Portugal:

        1) "On the Spot Firm" (Empresa na Hora). This is currently the most common
        way to register a business. This service enables to set up a company in less

  4   Register with the Social Security Regional Center                              Less than one day    no charge
      Agency : Social Security Regional Center                                       (online procedure)

      The employers shall communicate the admission of employees to the
      Portuguese Social Security services of the area of the employee's workplace,
      by any written means, or online at www.seg-social.pt, within (i) 24 hours
      preceding the employment agreement’s entry into force; or (ii) 24 hours
      following the beginning of the activity, whenever – due to exceptional and
      duly justi ed reasons in connection with the conclusion of very short term
      employment agreements or due to shift work – such notice cannot be served
      within the set out deadline.

      The non-compliance with this obligation implies the assumption that the
      relevant employee started to work for the company on the 1st working day
      of the sixth month prior to the occurrence of the infringement. In case the
      relevant employee is receiving sickness or unemployment bene ts there is
      also an assumption that the employ started to work for the company on the
      date in which those bene ts were granted, whereby the company will be
      severally liable for returning the whole amounts unduly received by the
      employee by the Portuguese Social Security. Moreover, the non-compliance
      with the above mentioned obligation may result in a minor or a serious
      misdemeanor, depending on its compliance within 24 hours after the
      deadline or after that, corresponding to a ne from € 75 up to € 4,800.
      Pursuant to the enacted Law No. 83-C/2013, of 31 December 2013, the above
      mentioned communication will now have to be made online.

      Agency : Private Insurer

      In order to guarantee an e ective compensation of damages arising from
      work accidents covering employees, trainees and paid managers, the
      Portuguese legislator requires from the employer the transfer of all its
      responsibility to insurance companies, before the entry into force of the
      relevant agreements. In case not all the responsibilities are transferred by
      the employer to the insurance company, the rst one will be solely
      responsible in the extent of the non transferred responsibilities.


      Furthermore, the non-compliance with the above mentioned obligation may
      trigger a very serious misdemeanor, implying the payment of a ne between
      € 3,264 and € 19,380.

    6   Register employees with the Labor Compensation Funds (FCT and FGCT)            Less than one day        no charge
        Agency : Labor Compensation Funds (Fundo de Compensação do Trabalho -          (online procedure)
        FCT and Fundo de Garantia de Compensação do Trabalho - FGCT)

        According to the Portuguese labor law (Law 70 of August 30, 2013),
        employees shall be registered in two Labor Compensation Funds (Fundo de
        Compensação do Trabalho - FCT and Fundo de Garantia de Compensação do
        Trabalho - FGCT). Registration at FGCT takes place automatically once one
        registers with FCT online.


        The contribution to these funds is intended to enable the payment of part of
        the compensation eventually due in case of termination of the employment
        agreement. The employer is responsible for the monthly payment of the
        amount of 0.925% to FCT and of 0.075% to FGCT, both calculated on the
        amount of base salary and seniority premiums due to each employee.

  Applies to women only.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      Agency : Municipality

      The land-use regime in the area of the site is regulated by a detail plan in
      force or an approved allotment project. A building notice procedure should
      then be followed to obtain approval of the building design.
      BuildCo submits an application for a building permit to the municipality. The
      application must comply with a statutory list of submission requirements.
      The architectural design and liability declarations of the designers are
      among the elements that must be submitted.
      The municipality veri es whether the application complies with the
      administrative requirements and the architectural design complies with the
      detail plan or approved allotment project and building regulations.
      The municipality also assess if external public entities must be consulted. If
      that is the case, the municipality forwards the application to the
      coordination and regional development commission that sends it to the
      external public entities that have to be consulted. Their appraisals must be
      sent back to the commission within 20 or 40 days, depending on nature of
      the external public entity. The applicant may also choose to consult directly
      with the external public entities for a forehand approval/appraisal of the
      design and submit their answers together with the application to the
      municipality, as it is the case with BuildCo.
      The municipality must decide on the application within 20 days of its
      submission, or 60 days if external public entities are consulted.



      The cost to obtain the approval of the building design is EUR 348.08.

      The legal basis of the above is the following:
      1. Decree-Law No. 555/99 with amendments (Art 4.4.c, 10.1, 10.2, 11.2. 11.3,

      Agency : Municipality

      Within one year from the date of noti cation of nal approval of the building
      design, BuildCo must request the building permit to be issued and pay the
      relevant taxes. The municipality issues the building permit within 30 days of
      the date of the request. There are statutory requirements on how to request
      the building permit certi cate and also on the content of the certi cate.
      BuildCo posts an announcement at the construction site within 10 days after
      a building permit is obtained. This announcement must follow a
      standardised format and content established by law and remain visible until
      the end of the construction works.

      The cost to obtain the building permit is EUR 357.25 plus EUR 1.31 per                                                       Page 14

      Based on Article 8-A of Decree-Law No. 555/99 with amendments, BuildCo
      has until ve days before the start of the construction works on the site to
      inform the municipality of his intentions, as well as of the identity of the
      technical director responsible for the works. This procedure can only be
      actioned upon the start of the construction, thus it cannot be a
      simultaneous process with the previous one.

      According to Art 15.1, 15.2 and 15.3 of Decree-Law 273/2003, BuildCo must
      inform the Labor Conditions Agency before starting construction work. This
      is only necessary if one of the following conditions occur:
      1. Construction work takes longer than 30 days and have more than 20
      workers simultaneously on the site at any moment; or
      2. Construction work takes more than 500 man days of work.

      There are statutory requirements on the content of the notice to the Labor
      Conditions Agency. Since this procedure can be addressed in the Labor
      Conditions Agency, it can be a simultaneous one.

      The Labor Conditions Agency may perform on-site inspections during
      construction. The Agency has been conducting more inspections in recent
      years. The inspections mainly examine health and safety conditions. The
                                                                                                            Page 15

       The Labor Conditions Agency may perform on-site inspections during
       construction. The Agency has been conducting more inspections in recent
       years. The inspections mainly examine health and safety conditions. The
       agency will also check for employment contracts and the legal status of
       workers. A construction site can be inspected more than once during the
       term of a building permit.
       Source:Activity of Labor Conditions Agency: 2013 report, pp. 133-135.


       This procedure can only be actioned once the request to the Labor
       Conditions Agency has been done. For that reason it cannot be a
       simultaneous process with the previous one.



   6   Receive inspection from Municipality                                               1 day   no charge
       Agency : Municipality

       According to Art. 93, 94, 95 and 96 of Decree-Law no. 555/99 with
       amendments, during construction, other public authorities may also carry
       out unscheduled inspections to the site to accomplish their supervision role.
       The municipality may carry out site inspections without notifying the
       developer beforehand. All aspects of the construction works can be checked
       during inspections, including the construction log book. Construction works
       are selected randomly, except if complaints have been made. Such cases are
       more likely to undergo a site inspection by municipal building inspectors.
       The Real Estate and Construction Institute may also carry out site
       inspections.


       This procedure can only be actioned once the construction has started. For
       that reason it cannot be a simultaneous process with the previous one.

       The construction site might also receive unscheduled inspections from the
       Institute of Construction and Real Estate (Instituto da Construção e do
       Imobiliário - INCI) to check if BuildCo has the “alvara” and the construction
       permit.

       The legal basis is article 25 of Decreto Lei No. 12 published on January 8, 2004
       and article 5 of Portaria N. 378 of November 20, 2012.


       This procedure can only be actioned once the construction has nished. For
       that reason it cannot be a simultaneous process with the previous one.

       Agency : Municipality

       Once the building has been completed, BuildCo requests the municipality to
       issue an occupancy permit for the building. There is a statutory list of
       submission requirements to request an occupancy permit. If the actual
       construction works executed on the site di er from the approved designs,
       an updated set of design documents must be presented to the municipality
       with the request for the occupancy permit. The construction log book, and a
                                                                                                              Page 16

       Once the building has been completed, BuildCo requests the municipality to
       issue an occupancy permit for the building. There is a statutory list of
       submission requirements to request an occupancy permit. If the actual
       construction works executed on the site di er from the approved designs,
       an updated set of design documents must be presented to the municipality
       with the request for the occupancy permit. The construction log book, and a
       liability declaration by the construction director must be presented as well.
       In this declaration, the construction director states that the construction
       works were carried out according to the approved design, and, where
       applicable, changes comply with the relevant legal and regulatory
       requirements.
       Within 10 days of the submission of the request the municipality informs
       BuildCo if the occupancy permit will be granted on the basis of the liability
       declaration mentioned above. No site inspection is required, unless the
       municipality has doubts about whether the construction works comply with
       the approved design. If a site inspection is determined, it takes place within
       15 days.

       According to Article 7 of Fee Schedule (2014) from Oeiras, the occupancy
       permit costs EUR 81.49 + EUR 10.56 per 50 sq. m.

       The legal basis of the above is the following:
       1- Ordinance No. 113/2015 (Annex I, no.25)
       2- Decree-Law No. 555/99 with amendments, Art 63, Art 64.1, Art 64.2, Art

       Agency : Municipality

       Once BuildCo has been noti ed that the occupancy permit will be issued, it
       has one year to request it from the City Hall. There are statutory
       requirements for applying for the occupancy permit and for the content of
       the permit. The occupancy permit is granted by the City Hall within 5 days of
       the submission of the request. The building can start being legally used only
       after the occupancy permit is issued.

       The legal basis of the above is the following:

       Agency : Municipal Water and Sanitation Authority

       The steps for obtaining a water and sewerage connection are as follows:
       – BuildCo informs the utility until 5 working days before the beginning of the
       construction works on the water and sewerage networks.
       –During construction, the utility, directly or through a certi ed entity, can
       carry out site inspections whenever deemed appropriate and without
       notifying the developer beforehand.
       –BuildCo informs the utility when the construction works on the water and
       sewerage networks are complete and asks for a nal site inspection. Liability
       declarations of the technicians responsible for construction of the water and
       sewage networks must then be submitted.
       – Within 7 days the utility, or a certi ed entity on its behalf, carries out a nal
       inspection of the water and sewerage networks. Pipes must not be covered
       before being inspected.
       –If construction was done according to the approved design and the network
       met the test conditions, the utility considers the construction works on the
       water and sewerage networks complete.
       –BuildCo demands the permanent connection to the public water and
       sewerage networks. The water connection is carried out by the water utility
       within 15 days. The sewerage connection is carried out by BuildCo.
       –BuildCo and the water utility celebrate a water supply contract and the
       water meters are installed within 3 days.
       Usually these tasks are carried out before the construction of the building is
       complete. A water and sewerage connection is required to get an occupancy
       permit.

       BuildCo must pay a total of EUR 7,570.50 to obtain water and sewerage
       connection. The cost breakdown is the following:

       1. Connection to the water network:
       For distances until 20 m – no charge.
       For distances greater than 20 m: 13.29 € / meter


       2. Connection to the sewerage network: 37.18 € / meter

       This procedure can only be actioned once request for these services has
       been donet. For that reason it cannot be a simultaneous process with the
       previous one.

      Agency : Real Estate Registry

      Once the description of the property in the tax authority has been updated,
      BuildCo requests the update of the description in the Real Estate Registry.
      The update is done within 5-10 days. If the request is deemed urgent, the
      registration takes place within 1 day.

      The cost to register the building with the Real Estate Registry is EUR 60.

      The legal basis is the following:
      1- Decree-Law No. 224/84 with amendments, Art 75.1
      2- Decree-Law No. 322-A/2001 with amendments. Art 21.3.1

 14   Agency : Tax Authority

      Once the occupancy permit has been granted, BuildCo has 60 days to inform
      the tax authority. There is an o cial form for this purpose. The architectural
      design, updated with any modi cation carried out during construction, is
      attached to the o cial form. The tax authority updates the description of the
      property in the tax authority registry. A site inspection is only required if
      there are not enough elements to assess the taxable value of the property.

      The legal basis of the above is the following:
      1- Decree-Law No. 287/2003 with amendments, Art 13.1.d., 13.3, 37.1 and 37.2
      2- Declaration for enrollment or updating of urban buildings in the array
      (Model 1)

      This procedure can be done in parallel with the registration. For that reason
      it can be a simultaneous process with the previous one.

If the minimum outage time considered for SAIDI/SAIFI is over 5 minutes, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.




    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      comes with a laptop with secured access to the database to complete the
      property transfer in their o ce. At the one-stop shop, the public employee
      will verify the following aspects: • Identity of parties • Powers of attorney
      (stating that the individuals are legal representatives of the rms) • Verify the
      legality of the transaction (that all laws are ful lled) • Verify the ownership
      and the encumbrances (with access to the “predial” database) • Verify that all
      taxes have been paid (with access to the Tax administration’s database)
      Once all the checks are completed, if there are any outstanding taxes, those
      can be paid at Casa pronta, though a speci c agreement between the Tax
      Authorities and Casa pronta. A receipt is issued to show that the taxes have
      been paid. The deed is prepared and submitted, and the transaction is
      completed. Property registration is mandatory in Portugal and the one stop
      shop process is available since July 2008, and its use is gradually increasing.
      As an alternative to using the Casa pronta, it is possible to use the services of
      a notary or a lawyer (lawyers can do so only since 2008) to prepare and
      authenticate the deed and verify tax payments. The authenticated deed can
      be submitted to the Predial (land registry, www.predialonline.pt). Only an
      authenticated deed can be submitted to the Predial. Predial has 307
      property registries (in each municipality) all connected to a central database.
      Casa pronta is an interface with the buyers and sellers that is connected to
      the central database managed by the “Registo Predial” (land registry).
      Preemption rights exist in Portugal but are not mandatory, unless the
      property is located in special areas (old town, cultural, or close to airport or
      near railways). In many commercial areas there is no need for such a waiver.



      In addition to «On the spot house» (that works as describe above), land
      registry requests can be performed online. When people prefer to perform a
      public deed, instead of the simpli ed procedure, they can apply for the
      registry sending the deed through a web site
      (http://www.predialonline.pt/PredialOnline/). In this case the applicant needs
      to be authenticated with a quali ed digital certi cate, as the one every
      Portuguese citizen as in his/her citizens card. The online procedure however
      may take up to a week to be processed.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.

                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
