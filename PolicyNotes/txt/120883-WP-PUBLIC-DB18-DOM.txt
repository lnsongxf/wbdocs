About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Resolution 5/2004 one needs to request a certi cate to use the land and also
      obtain a certi cate of no objection prior to obtaining the construction
      permit. Moreover, in order to obtain the certi cate to use the land an
      inspection by the Municipal Council is required (the o cial cost for this
      inspection is DOP 500.00.).
      The land-use certi cate confers the right to build on the plot, but it does not
      authorize construction. The certi cate ensures that the project conforms to
      zoning regulations.
      The certi cate of no objection is a certi cate which according to your project
      plans, elevations and sections approves and appoints the urban design
      parameters.

      The request must be accompanied by several documents related to the land,
      including:
      • A copy (simple, unnotarized) of the real property deed for the plot (does
      not have to be recently obtained)
      • A cadastral plan
      • A map of the project’s location and a rst draft of the project design
      drawings

      A soil study is a requirement by law(Ministerio de Salud Pública. Guía para el
      diseño y la construcción estructural y no estructural) to obtain a building
      permit and it is a requirement for other procedures. In practice contractors
      ask for a soil test to ensure that the foundation of the building is solid. The
      engineer must understand the suitability of the soil for the proposed
      construction work. Soil test allows to build a solid foundation and avoid
      structures to be damaged or collapsed or leaned.

       Municipal Council
       Agency : Municipal Council (Departamento de Planeamiento Urbano del
       Ayuntamiento de la jurisdicción correspondiente)

       The request for approval of the project design drawings must be
       accompanied by several documents, including the property deed, the
       cadastral plan, and project design drawings, certi ed by an architect or
       engineer registered at the Dominican College of Engineers and Architects
       (CODIA) by the corresponding Municipal Council. BuildCo must request an
       inspection upon ling the project drawings. This is a prerequisite for other
       procedures.


       Once the request is approved by the Municipal Council, the Municipality
       forwards the request to the Ministry of Public Works and Communications.
       The Ministry then grants a construction license for the project. The license is
       granted to the project itself and not to BuildCo. During this process, BuildCo
       must follow up with both agencies to ensure license processing.
       Construction must commence within 1 year from the date of issuance of the
       license.

       According to Resolution #5 2004 of the National District O ce
       (Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional de Santo Domingo) the o cial cost for
       the construction of a warehouse is DOP 75.00 per sq. m. For a warehouse of

       According to article 86 of the Regulations for the Supervision and General
       Inspection of Work (R-0004 Reglamento para la Supervision e Inspeccion
       General de Obras), all projects which have been subject to the review and
       approval of project design drawing by the Ministry of Public Works and
       Communications (O cina de Tramitacion de Planos) must be previously
       inspected (pre-registration) to verify that the construction has not started.

      and sends them to EDESUR for approval. In those plans the electrician
      speci es the nature of the transformer to be installed. Two copies of the
      plans need to be submitted to the nearest commercial o ce of EDESUR to
      the neighborhood of the warehouse.


      EDESUR analyses the interconnection plans and suggest corrections. It
      would require on average two to three visits to EDESUR to correct plans. A
      tax of RD$ 2,500 must be paid at the time of submission of the application by
      the client and RD$ 1,500 for any further visit for submission of corrected
      plans. An additional RD$ 1,000 for project review is also charged.

      When the nal connections have been approved, the client will have to
      submit 6 copies of the plans and EDESUR will give only 5 stamped copies
      back to the client.

      Agency : Electrician

      Once the interconnection plans have been approved by EDESUR, the
      electrician previously hired by the client, will proceed to build the electric
      system (medium voltage net, substation, meter, etc.)

      EDESUR comes to check that the works follow the approved plan and raises
      observations to correct those works which do not follow the approved plans.
      The client must request the inspection when he considers everything is
      ready for interconnection. The rst inspection do not bear any cost, but
      EDESUR charges RD$ 500 for each inspection after the third one. EDESUR
      delivers a letter of approval (carta de Aceptación de la Obra).

      Agency : Edesur

      The interconnection estimate contains the cost that the client must pay to
      EDESUR to carry out the interconnection works to the electricity distribution
      network. The client must submit the nal letter of approval of EDESUR, two
      copies of the approved plans, a CD with the approved plan in DWG, a letter
      of request of estimate and he has to pay a stamp duty of RD$ 1,000.00.

       Agency : Edesur

       Interconnection works are carried out by EDESUR with a TCT team (Brigada
       de Trabajo Con Tensión). If the works cannot be carried out with full voltage,
       EDESUR will stop the energy in the circuit and will charge that cost to the
       client.

       The client has to open a user account with EDESUR. The client has to deposit
       an amount which is reimbursed at the cancelation of the contract. The
       deposit equals twice the client's bill in RD$ and it is calculated on the basis of
       the capacity declared by the client or as a percentage of the substation
       capacity which would go between 60 to 80%. Law 125-01 establishes a
       payment of monthly interest for the deposit but this dispositions have not
       been implemented yet.

      former mortgage would be cancelled to record the new one, with no

      5,000 to be paid every time a new Certi cate of Title is issued after a property
      transaction (in practice, this Fund has not been created yet and Registrars
      are not requiring them). After all payments have been made and all
      documents are ready, the buyer will apply for registration of the property
      under his name at the Property Registry.

      The registrar will analyze the documentation and, if everything is correct, will
      register the property under the name of the buyer, issue a new Certi cate of
      Title in the name of the buyer, cancel the old Certi cate and will set the date
      for giving the new title to the buyer.

      Because of the higher workload, this procedure takes longer in Santo
      Domingo and Santiago than in other provinces, taking between 20 and 30
      days to complete this procedure.



      However, the “Ley de Registro de la Propiedad Inmobiliaria”, passed on
      March 2005 to replace the previous law from 1947, together with the
      "Reglamento General del Registro de Títulos" of September 2009, introduced
      changes into the system seen up to now. The registrar should take no more
      than 45 days to qualify the transfer.



      The led documentation shall include:



      (i) Notarized purchase agreement (obtained in Procedure 4).


      (ii) Real estate property taxes declaration; receipt of payment; and
      Certi cation issued by the Tax Authority stating the Seller is up to date on
      the payment of taxes on the real estate property (obtained in Procedure 5).


      (iii) Payment of stamp duties (completed in this procedure).


      (iv) Copy of identity documents for seller and buyer (such documents may
      vary whether seller and buyer are natural persons or companies).


      (v) Copies of their Mercantile Registration Certi cate ("Certi cado de Registro
      Mercantil") issued by the corresponding Chamber of Commerce, and


      (vi) Certi cate of registration at the National Taxpayers Registry ("RNC")
      issued by the Dirección General de Impuestos Internos (the Tax Authority)



      It should also be noted that the Buyer is also required to le the original
      copy of the Title Certi cate. Furthermore, if either Buyer and/or Seller are
      companies or legal entities, the authorities will require evidence of the
      corporate approval of the transaction (i.e. minutes of the meeting of the
      corporate body that has authorized the purchase/sale). Another relevant
      point is that if the Buyer and/or Seller are foreigners, they must present two
      di erent copy of their identity documents: their passport and any o cial
      identi cation from their country of origin.




      The land registry operates with the Torrens title system and is being digitized
      since 2005. All new transactions are completed digitally, but all titles created
      before 2005 are not digitized yet. The registry has consultation room units
      (“Departamento de sala de consultas”) where the registry’s electronic
      database is available.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business 2018          Dominican Republic


    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
