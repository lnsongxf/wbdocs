About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of
    the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0
    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      BuildCo submits an online application form with the plans and all required
      documents, as prescribed by Section 337 of the BMC Act, at the sub-engineer
      of the concerned locality within the Eastern suburbs of Mumbai using the
      Common Application Form. At the same time, a video clip of the property
      and pictures taken from the four corners of the land plot are also submitted
      online.
      Using these documents, the sub-engineer reviews the plans and makes sure
      that the property card is mutated in the name of the owner of the land and
      signs on the plans. If all documents are in order and the le is complete,
      BuildCo can proceed to pay the scrutiny fees in the same building by cash or
      bank draft.
      Once the fees have been paid, the application le is forwarded to the
      concerned o cer in the Building Proposal O ce. Then the le is forwarded
      to the Survey O ce, which will remark on the application le and check the
      remarks from the Development Plan O ce (obtained during the design
      stage of the project). If the Survey O ce is satis ed with their review, they
      will send back the application le to the Building Proposal O ce within one
      week. After the site inspection, the application le returns to the Building
      Proposal O ce to receive an intimation of disapproval (authorization). The
      concerned Sub Engineer reviews the proposal and forwards the report to
      the Assistant Engineer and Executive Engineer. The proposal is approved at
      the Executive Engineer’s level if no concessions are involved. There are 3

      government authorities. Final clearance to build will only be given once
      BuildCo obtains all NOC’s. The NOC’s assigned to the intimation of

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator         Answer              Explanation

Proceeding        foreclosure         Bizbank is a secured creditor and upon a default by Mirage, it is most likely to seek to
                                      foreclose the loan and execute its security by selling the hotel. To enforce its security

                                      creditors will object before the High Court. Given that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
                                      has only been in force since 1 December 2016, a foreclosure is still the most likely procedure
                                      in practice.

Outcome           piecemeal sale      The reason why BizBank initiates the foreclosure process is that the hotel is unable to pay its
                                      debts and the hotel expects operating losses in 2017 as well as 2018. Hence, in order to pay
                                      the debts, the hotel assets will be sold piecemeal and the hotel will stop operating.

Time (in years)   4.3                 Bizbank will apply to the Debt Recovery Tribunal to enforce its security. This will take a couple
                                      of months. But other creditors (including tax authorities) and Mirage itself will file objections
                                      in front of the High Court, which will delay the proceedings substantially. Given the high
                                      backlog of cases in India's High Courts, the foreclosure procedure until BizBank is repaid
                                      some or all of the money owed to it takes about 4.3 years.

Cost (% of        9.0                 The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 9% of the value of the
estate)                               debtor's estate. Costs incurred during the entire foreclosure process mainly include court or
                                      government agency fees (INR 300,000, according to Mumbai Court fees Act, 1959), attorney
                                      fees (INR 100,000), costs of notification and publication (INR 25,000), fees of accountants,
                                      assessors, inspectors and other professionals (INR 100,000), fees of auctioneers (INR 50,000),
                                      fees of service providers and/or government levies (INR 100,000-200,000), and other fees (INR

Proceeding        foreclosure        Bizbank is a secured creditor and upon a default by Mirage, it is most likely to seek to

                                     creditors will object before the High Court. Given that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code
                                     has only been in force since 1 December 2016, a foreclosure is still the most likely procedure
                                     in practice.

Outcome           piecemeal sale     The reason why BizBank initiates the foreclosure process is that the hotel is unable to pay its
                                     debts and the hotel expects operating losses in 2017 as well as 2018. Hence, in order to pay
                                     the debts, the hotel assets will be sold piecemeal and the hotel will stop operating.

Time (in years)   4.3                Bizbank will apply to the Debt Recovery Tribunal to enforce its security. This will take a couple
                                     of months. But other creditors (including tax authorities) and Mirage itself will file objections
                                     in front of the High Court, which will delay the proceedings substantially. Given the high
                                     backlog of cases in India's High Courts, the foreclosure procedure until BizBank is repaid
                                     some or all of the money owed to it takes about 4.3 years.

Cost (% of        9.0                The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 9% of the value of the
estate)                              debtor's estate. Costs incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court or
