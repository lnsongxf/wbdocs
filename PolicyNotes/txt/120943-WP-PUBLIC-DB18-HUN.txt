About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      Agency : Municipal Planning Board

      The Municipal Planning Board has to approve the basic project plan (not the
      detailed architectural plans) of the building. During this approval the
      Municipal Planning Board establishes whether the building will be far away
      from other neighboring buildings, how it ts into the landscape, and whether
      the envisioned construction project complies with the aesthetic standards of
      the region.

      Agency : Private Licensed Company

      BuildCo hires an external geo-technician in order to study the land’s
      capacity, quality, and its groundwater properties. The hired technician visits
      the site and digs the land at two or three points depending on the quality of
      the land. The cost recorded is based on two digging points. The technician
      submits the soil samples to a laboratory. The lab result de nes the methods
      by which the foundation of the warehouse is laid. This information is also
      necessary in order for BuildCo’s architect to draw the architectural plans.
      BuildCo is required to attach the geo-technician's report as part of the
      technical documentation for the construction license, pursuant to
      Regulation No. 312/2012. (XI. 8.).

       update the log on a daily basis during construction with the following
       information:

       - The type of work completed on the site
       - The number of people who worked
       - The updated certi cates on the waste removals

       The regulations regarding the implementation process, as well as the usage
       of the e-construction log is regulated in Regulation No. 191/2009 (IX. 15.).

       Agency : Budapest Water Works

       BuildCo is responsible for setting up the water pit within one meter from the
       property line. The water pit is needed because the meter will be placed there                                Page 17

 12   Request and obtain water connection from Budapest Waterworks Ltd.                     10 days    HUF 361,100
      Agency : Budapest Water Works

      BuildCo is responsible for setting up the water pit within one meter from the
      property line. The water pit is needed because the meter will be placed there
      by the utility. After the water pit is installed, BuildCo sends back the contract
      and pays the external connection fee along with the utility public
      development contribution fee (a fee for a new water connection). Then
      BuildCo informs Budapest Waterworks Ltd. in order to check that the
      installation of the water pit was properly installed. The utility then installs the
      pipes in order to connect the external and internal network, disinfects the
      pipes, ensures a pressure-, functional-, impermeability-, geodetic measure
      tests, and then installs the water meter.

      The process of installing the connection can take place anytime prior, during
      or after the construction of the warehouse or the on-site pipes or even
      before granting BuildCo the construction license. However, it has to be
      completed before obtaining the occupancy permit.

 13   Request and obtain sewerage connection                                                21 days    HUF 363,659
      Agency : Budapest Sewage Works

      The connection work is done by BuildCo’s hired technician. Until the water
      meter is installed by Budapest Waterworks Ltd., the sewage service cannot
      be used because the water meter monitors the monthly billing of the sewage
      usage as well.
      BuildCo noti es the utility after the connection work is completed, and the
      utility subsequently inspects the site to verify whether the connection was
      done. After the connection has been successfully completed, and BuildCo
      has returned the signed contract and paid the inspection fee and the public
      utility development contribution fee (fee for any new sewage connection),
      the utility will issue the occupancy permit for the sewage network.
      For more complex buildings, there is generally a requirement to obtain a
      utility statement on capacity from the sewage authorities, but for the Doing
      Business case study, this requirement does not apply because the sewage
      main is available.

 14   Agency : Lechner Knowledge Center (Lechner Tudásközpont)

      BuildCo closes the e-construction log once all of the work is completed on-
      site and must upload the following documents:

      - Daily, detailed updates on the type of work completed on the site
      - Certi cates on the waste removals
      - Operational and maintenance instructions to the warehouse
      - Warranty documents
      - Report indicating that the site manager has handed the site over to
      BuildCo, which proves that the construction has been completed on the site

      The closure of the log serves as BuildCo's noti cation to the Building and
      Heritage Protection Unit and to the Building Department of the completion
      of the construction.

      Agency : Land Registry

      BuildCo must obtain a new geodetic map drawn by a hired surveyor any time
      after the construction is completed on-site. The hired surveyor submits the
      map to the Land Registry. According to the 2004. CXL. Law, the Land Registry
      reviews and authorizes the new geodetic map (the map includes the newly
      built warehouse) from a cartographic point of view. After the Land Registry
      approves the new geodetic map, the hired surveyor submits it to the “OÉNY”
      National Building Register online platform before or at the same time
      requesting the occupancy permit. This is an open source database, where
      anyone can obtain information on any property.


      During the authorization process of the occupancy permit, the Building
      Department also reviews the new geodetic map to verify whether it complies
      with construction license regulations.

      Receive on-site inspection to check on the quality of water                       10 days   HUF 29,000
 16   Agency : National Public Health and Medical O cer Service (ANTSZ)

      A representative from the National Public Health and Medical O cer Service
      (ANTSZ) comes to inspect the quality of water. The representative takes a
      sample of the water and sends it to the lab for testing. The approval is issued
      within 10 days.

      Obtaining approval on the cleanliness of water is one of the conditions that
      the Public Health Unit set before its approval for construction license. These
      condition must be completed prior to applying for the occupancy permit of
      the building since the Public Health Unit requires this document in order to
      approve the occupancy permit. It has to be done before the occupancy
      permit, and after the water and sewage network were installed.

      each of the specialized authorities. The Fire Protection Unit mandates that
      the re alarm occupancy permit be issued before the construction
      occupancy permit can be requested.

      A specialist from the Fire Protection Unit visits the site and inspects whether
      the re taps and the re water system of the building comply with
      regulations. Once the on-site inspection is done, the Fire Protection Unit
      issues a declaration that the building has been completed in compliance

       After receiving the nal inspection, BuildCo applies for the occupancy permit
       through the ETDR online system, which was introduced on October 1, 2013.
       Once the occupancy permit is granted, the Building Department noti es the
       Land Registry directly in order for the Land Registry to update the site
       ownership certi cate and the site map. The Land Registry will note the
       function of the newly built warehouse on the site ownership certi cate, as
       well as the shape and the function of the new warehouse on the site map.
       After it is completed, the warehouse can be sold.

       BuildCo does not have to apply for the registration of the building. BuildCo
       just has to submit the new geodetic map prior to requesting the occupancy
       permit application/or the same time. After it is granted the Building
       Department noti es the Land Registry, so the process is automatic.
       Howerver, BuildCo only has to pay the processing fee of HUF 6,600 as it is
       noted at "Register the building with the Land Registry O ce".

      The utility prepares the design and carries out the external connection
      works. The utility also obtains all necessary approvals on behalf of the
      customer.

      Based on the o er accepted by the customer after applying for connection,
      the utility prepares the grid connection contract which includes a detailed
      project plan and its timeframe, the invoice of the connection, the payment
      deadlines, and the deadline for placing the meter box. The applicant has to
      sign the grid connection contract and pay 10% of the total connection fee.
      Simultaneously, the utility hires an external electrical engineer to prepare an
      implementation plan and design the project for the external network. The
      electrical engineer obtains all the required maps from the gas,
      telecommunication, water and sewage utilities in order to examine whether
      there is any con ict with the existing underground networks. The electrical
      engineer draws the implementation plan and has it approved by the utility’s
      project manager. Once this implementation map is cleared internally, it is
      submitted for approval by gas, telecommunication, water and sewage
      utilities.
      Authorizations have to be obtained from all interested public authorities,
      such as the notary from the Mayor’s O ce of the local Municipality and
      specialized authorities (Environment Protection Authority, local Road
      Department, Hungarian Road Authority, etc.). Each authority has maximum
      30 days to review the plans. In practice, this can take longer. The
      authorization process is regulated by the governmental Regulation no.
      382/2007 (XII.23.). Simultaneously, permission have to be obtained from the
      owners of neighboring lands whose properties are impacted by constructing
      the cables. Oftentimes, there are multiple interested parties that need to be
      noti ed.
      Once all approvals have been obtained, the new geodetic map with the
      underground cables has to be authorized for registration by the local Land
      Registry. The Land Registry overviews the map from a cartographic point of
      view. After the Land Registry registered the map, the utility requests a
      construction right from the Measurement and Technical Safety Authority
      (Budapest Capital City Government O ce). The authority reviews the new
      geodetic map to verify whether it complies with regulations. The
      construction right allows the utility to access the customer’s and all of the                                            Page 26

       to access the installed cables in the future, should any further work be
       needed. The process of obtaining the cable right is regulated by the
       Electricity Law (2007. LXXXVI.). The Measurement and Technical Safety
       Authority has maximum 60 days to overview and authorize the plans. After
       the construction right is granted, the department informs the utilities (gas,
       telecommunication, water and sewage), the relevant specialized authorities,
       and the owners of the interested lands. These parties can appeal the
       decision within 15 days after receiving the notice from the department. Once
       the appeal period expires, the construction license of the cables is legally
       binding and ELMŰ Hálózati Kft. can start the connection works.
       Once the construction license of the cables is legally binding, the Land
       Registry calculates the exact size of the area a ected by the new cables. This
       calculation takes into account regulations on safety distances and on the
       size limits of the cables installed on public and private lands. The Land
       Registry adds the results of the calculations to all of the properties’ site
       ownership certi cate and the site map.
       15 days before the connection works starts, the utility noti es all the relevant
       parties (the Measurement and Technical Safety Authority, the local notary,
       the neighbors) on the exact date of the power outage due to the
       construction on site. Before the construction can start, the applicant is
       required to pay the remaining 90% of the connection fee. The external
       connection works takes around 2-3 days. All the project related documents
       during the construction are submitted electronically to the e-construction
       log.

       from the utility
       Agency : Measurement Technology and Meter Controlling Department, ELMŰ
       Hálózati Kft.

       The customer needs to obtain a permit from the Measurement Technology
       and Meter Controlling Department of the utility to install the cables within
       the meter box. These cables are connecting the external cables to the
       internal one. This step is required in order to connect the warehouse with
       electricity, and it can be done at any time after the grid connection
       application is obtained. Typically, the customer requests the approval once
       the starting date of the external connection work is given by the utility.

       Agency : Licensed electricity supplier

       The customer chooses the most suitable electricity supplier from the
       market. The supplier sends to the customer the supply contract, which
       includes a statement on the agreement to provide electricity. The customer
       forwards the statement on the agreement to provide electricity to the utility.
       This statement is required before making a request for meter installation,
       and can be obtained at any time after grid connection application is
       obtained. Typically, the customer requests the agreement once the starting
       date of the external connection work is given by the utility.

        The customer has to sign the grid usage contract, grid connection contract
        and supply contract. These three contracts are not necessarily signed in
        parallel. Upon connection, the grid charge becomes due and payable, while
        the date of conclusion of the supply contract is up to the customer. The rst
        two contracts take only few hours (sample contracts to ll in) while the third
        one takes some days. The installation of the meter and the start of supply of
        electricity require all three contracts to be signed. The meter is not installed
        at the same time as when the connection is done. The utility (Measurement
        technology and meter controlling department) is installing the meter.

      Since the parties of the property transfer are companies, they should obtain
      an extract from the commercial registry both for the buyer and the seller.
      The extract (as well as the specimen of signature) is to be led for both
      parties to the Land Registry O ce. With the data indicated in the extract the
      o cer can check that the legal entity really exists and that the manager is
      really entitled to sign for the company. The commercial register is public, so
      anybody can go there and ask for a company extract. The extract has to
      contain the deleted and actual data of the company, and may not be issued
      earlier than 30 days preceding the sale. In case the data of the seller have
      not been amended as of the date of purchase (or any further ling), it is
      su cient to refer to this fact on the standardized application form, together
      with the case number in which the required documents had been led. If no
      such reference is made, the cost of the extract is payable both in relation to
      the seller and the buyer. The cost varies according to the issuing agencies
      and the length of the extract. Generally, the cost is between HUF 3,000 and
      7,000.

       A new fast-track procedure has been introduced to reduce the registration
       time at the Land Registry for a higher registration fee of HUF 16,600. The                              (registration fee,
       registration fee for the regular procedure is HUF 6,600 according to Act 122                            expedited
       of 2006, e ective February 4, 2007. As of January 2006, it is possible to                               Procedure), or
       retrieve a standardized application form online at: www.takarnet.hu.                                    HUF 6,600
       The Registry o ce only accepts this standard form. Once the application has                             (registration fee,
       been submitted to the Land Registry O ce, one set of the documents are                                  regular Procedure)
       forwarded to the stamp duty o ce. The purchaser then receives a letter
       from the stamp duty o ce and will pay stamp duty by postal check or bank
       transfer.


       Note: Usually, if the purchaser does not pay the full purchase price at the
       signing of the contract, the vendor retains its ownership. (Such retention
       may be registered until the payment of the full purchase price). The
       application may request the registration of the sale with retention of
       ownership, or the registration of title. As of a regulation issued in January
       2006, the seller may declare that he/she will request registration of the
       purchaser's title at a certain date, but no later than 6 months from the date
       of the agreement. During this time period the registration is pending and no
       other registrations or applications may be ful lled regarding the property. In
       the event that the land registry o ce does not receive the consent from the
       owner of the property, the pending application is deleted. The fact of sale
       with retention of ownership is indicated on a side note within 24 hours from
       the submission. This means that some kind of application was submitted
       with regard to the property but it was not veri ed by the Land Registry O ce
       yet (not registered, not refused). For sales with retention of ownership, a
       declaration has to be submitted stating that the title may be registered,
       simultaneously with the deletion of the retention of ownership. Following the
       submission of the declaration, a new side note will be indicated, and the title
       of the purchaser will be registered.
       Transfers of property might be subject to a 27% VAT.

       As of 2010, the general duty rate on the transfer of property for
       consideration was reduced to 4% from 10% on up to HUF 1 billion
       (1,000,000,000) of the property value.
       The documentation shall include:
       (i) The standardized application form;
       (ii) Two original copies and one photocopy of the contract;
       (iii) Original extract of the purchaser from the commercial register;
       (iv) The company extract and the specimen of signature of both the seller
       and the purchaser are to be led.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer            Explanation

Proceeding           liquidation      Banks usually have a standard procedure to initiate liquidation, if a debtor defaults on a loan
                                      and remains in default for a certain period of time. Bizbank is not entitled to initiate
                                      reorganization, as it can only be filed by the debtor. As the most likely initial procedure is
                                      liquidation, it will not convert into any other procedure.

Outcome              piecemeal sale   The goal of liquidation proceedings is to provide satisfaction to the creditors of an insolvent
                                      debtor upon its winding-up without succession. Mirage has too much credits and, therefore,
                                      it will not be able to operate further.

Time (in years)      2.0              The court commences the liquidation proceedings of Mirage within 60 days upon receipt of
                                      BizBank's request. Once the order on the liquidation proceedings of Mirage becomes final,
                                      the court forthwith appoints the liquidator and orders the disclosure of such order in the
                                      Companies' Gazette. The creditors shall announce their claims within 40 days from the date
                                      of the above order. The creditors may also announce their claims after the 40 days' deadline
                                      but within 180 days, however, such claims will only be satisfied, once every other claim have
                                      been satisfied in accordance with the general waterfall rules. The first meeting of the
                                      creditors shall be held within 75 days after the disclosure of the liquidation order to form the
                                      creditors’ committee or appoint the creditors’ representative. In case the creditors
                                      established their committee, such may adopt a decision within 100 days from the publication
                                      date of the liquidation order to operate Mirage as a going concern during the insolvency
                                      proceedings (in case the creditors' committee has been established at a later stage, the
                                      decision on the operation of Mirage as a going concern during the insolvency proceedings
                                      may be adopted within 60 days from the establishment of the creditors' committee). The
                                      liquidator shall sell Mirage's assets through public sales. If the received amounts is sufficient
                                      to cover the claims of the creditors, the liquidator may prepare an interim financial
                                      statement following the deadline for the notification of claims and submit such to the
                                      competent court. The court may approve such interim financial statements within 30 days.
                                      The deadline for the submission of the final balance sheet is 24 months from the date of the
                                      publication of the order on liquidation proceedings.
