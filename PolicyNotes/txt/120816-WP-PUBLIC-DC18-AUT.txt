About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       applies for a new account number via ELDA (under the menu item, Online-
       Services [Kontonummeranforderung]) before a new employee is registered
       with the statutory health insurance o ce.


       Health insurance is obligatory: every new employee must be electronically
       registered with the statutory health insurance o ce prior to and no later
       than the day of employment. Unless the company does not own a
       computer, the employee must be registered via ELDA. Moreover, the
       employer must automatically extend obligatory health insurance upon
       entry. On being registered with the statutory health insurance o ce, the
       employee is automatically registered for accident insurance and retirement
       insurance as provided by law. No further registration is needed. By data
       transmission, the employee is immediately registered with the competent
       statutory health insurance o ce (social insurance o ce). The employer
       instantly receives a “sent” report and a con rmation of registration.

      during its operation. The plant permit is not obligatory required prior to
      obtaining a construction permit. However, it might be helpful obtaining the
      plant permit before obtaining a construction permit as the plant permit
      (potentially) will set out several requirements that should be considered in
      respect of the construction permit.

      Agency : Independent Expert - Energy Engineering

      Following the Directive of European Union 2002/91/EC the practice of
      requiring the so called “Energy Pass” (Energieausweiss) by the Municipality of
      Vienna has become compulsory for all projects as of January 2009. The
      energy pass is required when applying for the building permit at the relevant
      authority of City of Vienna. There are o cially licensed companies and
      individual engineers that issue the energy pass. The prices may range,
      however on average it is EUR 700.00 for a building with overall size of 1300.6
      sq. m. This procedure will normally take between 1-2 weeks to complete.

  3   Submit completion noti cation for internal wiring and obtain clearance                3 calendar days     EUR 24
      Agency : Wiener Netze GmbH

      The customer needs to obtain a clearance for the internal wiring installation
      from the network operator Wiener Netze GmbH in order to get an electricity
      connection (“Fertigstellungsanzeige”). The electrician who did the internal
      wiring has to do a completion noti cation (electrician completion
      noti cation) by sending this note to Wiener Netze GmbH as proof that the
      internal wiring is complying with security and safety standards. This
      clearance is done automatically, meaning the client does not have to go and
      pick it up, it is processed automatically. The connection contract will be
      concluded after the clearance.

  4   Obtain external works and meter installation by Wiener Netze GmbH                     6 calendar days     EUR 37,233.4
      Agency : Wiener Netze GmbH

      The external works start immediately after signature of the contract. The
      utility carries out the external work, and will also provide all the material and
      build a new transformer on the private ground of the customer. The meter
      gets installed at the same time. The utility installs the meter and is the owner
      of it. Electricity starts owing immediately if a contract with a supplier of
      electricity has been signed. The connection fees in Austria are composed of
      two parts: 1) Fee for accessing the net ("Netzzutrittsentgelt") which includes
      all costs such as labor and material cost. The utility installs standard
      transformers of 360kVA. In the case of a 140kVA connection, the customer
      would pay about half the cost of the transformer and the remaining capacity
      would be used by other customers. 2) Fee for using the net
      ("Netzbereitstellungsentgelt" at Netzebene 6). With a power connection of
      140kVA, the customer is automatically on Level 6, meaning the customer
      owns the connection to the transformer and is directly connected to the low
      tension side of the transformer. There are meter installation costs.

      The Distribution System Operator (Wiener Netze GmbH) only provides
      network services, so the customer needs to conclude a contract with a
      supplier in order to receive electricity. The customer can choose the
      electricity supplier of his/her choice – the largest supplier for the Vienna area
      is Wien Energie Vertrieb GmbH & Co KG, but any other supplier can also be
      chosen. The supply contract can be concluded already before the external                                                 Page 22

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      1. The signatures of seller and buyer have to be authenticated on the
      contract. That can be done by the notary or by court (time to complete:
      can be done within 30 minutes, if required, normally 1 day; cost: EUR
      134.90 per person (As of August 1, 2010 the costs for the authentication
      of the signatures were increased from EUR 111.30 to EUR 134.90 per
      signature as suggested by the Act on Fees of Public Notaries, last
      amended by the regulation Federal Law Gazetta BGBI II NR 218/2010);
      the fee of the court may di er slightly to the notary’s. Provided more
      than one signature has to be authenticated in one document (e.g. sales
      agreement), the costs for the further signature amount to 50% of the
      costs stated (i.e. EUR 67.50).


      2. In case of a corporation as seller or buyer the authorization of the
      signing representatives has to be proven. At the notaries o ce that is
      done with the authentication of the signatures; otherwise a certi ed
      excerpt out of the business register produced by the High Court
      (Landesgericht) has to be presented to the Land Book (time to complete:
      can be done within 30 minutes, normally 1 day; cost: EUR 13.7 per
      corporation).


      3. The parties have to pay Property Acquisition Tax or Transfer Tax
      (Grunderwerbssteuer) which, in this case, amounts to 3.5 % of the
      purchase price. They have to present to the Land Register a clearance
      certi cate (Unbedenklichkeitsbescheinigung) furnished by the tax
      authorities certifying that the tax was paid (time to complete: tax
      assessment will last about 4 weeks; to get the certi cate after paying the
      tax further 2 weeks; no extra costs). This clearance certi cate may be
      substituted by a self-assessment declaration
      (Selbstbemessungserklärung) led by a notary or a lawyer (attorney at
      law/solicitor) if the tax is paid to the notary or lawyer who cooperates
      with the tax authorities. The notary public or the attorney-at-law usually                                                  Page 28

      law/solicitor) if the tax is paid to the notary or lawyer who cooperates
      with the tax authorities. The notary public or the attorney-at-law usually
      issues the clearance certi cate stating that the real estate transfer tax
      (3.5% of the purchase price) and registration fee for the Land Register
      (1.1% of the purchase price) have been paid. The registration fee for the
      Land Register rises from 1% to 1.1 % of the purchase price due to the
      regulation Federal Law Gazetta BGBI I Nr 111/2010 and is e ective as of
      January 01, 2011. The certi cate will be issued immediately after the
      notary or lawyer has received the amount of the real estate transfer tax
      and registration fee. The money for the purchase and the taxes is given
      to the notary/lawyer on a trust account. The parties may set up the
      contract themselves or use a standard template. In late 2005, the Act
      concerning “Changes in the vocational law of notary public, attorneys-at-
      law and civil engineers” was announced, providing for the use of
      electronic signatures which are to be submitted electronically to the
      courts. This Act has therefore created the legal basis for online
      registration and electronic notarial attestation. This reform is e ective
      as of July 1, 2007.

                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer                 Explanation

Proceeding           liquidation           Mirage management has to initiate either insolvency proceedings or reorganization
                     (after an             proceedings within 60 days after the company becomes insolvent. Management is likely to
                     attempt at            apply for reorganization proceedings with self-administration, as it will allow them to
                     reorganization)       continue managing day-to-day operations of the business. However, one of the conditions of
                                           this proceeding is that creditors must be repaid at least 30% of the debt within two years,
                                           which is not possible in case of Mirage. Therefore, BizBank will vote against the plan and the
                                           proceedings will be converted into liquidation under Article 167 of the Insolvency Act.

Outcome              going concern         Mirage is a viable business and it is likely that it will be sold as a going concern and will
                                           continue operating under new ownership.

Time (in years)      1.1                   Mirage management will file for reorganization proceedings with self-administration within
                                           60 days after Mirage becomes insolvent. Together with the application, it must file a
                                           reorganization plan, which offers repayment of 30% of creditors' claims within 2 years of
                                           when the plan is adopted, an inventory of assets, a current status report and a liquidity plan
                                           for the next 90 days. The court will schedule a "reorganization hearing" where creditors
                                           representing 50% of the total outstanding debt, as well as the simple majority of creditors
                                           present at the hearing must vote in favor of the plan for it to be adopted. As it is not possible
                                           under the case assumptions that Mirage will be able to repay 30% of the claims with 2 years,
                                           the plan will be rejected. At that time, reorganization proceedings will be continued as
                                           bankruptcy proceedings. During bankruptcy proceedings, the court will appoint a receiver
                                           who will manage the debtor's assets. The court will hold several hearings, including the
                                           general creditors meeting right after the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, the
                                           examination hearing, where the receiver will acknowledge or reject creditors' claims, and the
                                           reporting hearing, where the receiver will report on the status of the proceedings. At the
                                           reporting hearing, the receiver will report on the pre-requisites for the sale of the business.
                                           Assets will probably be sold out of court by the receiver. After the assets are sold, the
                                           receiver will present a statement of accounts.

Cost (% of           10.0                  The majority of the expenses will be comprised of attorneys’ fees (5-8% of the value of the
estate)                                    estate) and fees of insolvency administrator (1-2% of the value of the estate), as well as
                                           payments to other professionals involved in the proceedings, such as accountants and other
                                           professionals (1-2%) of the value of the estate.
