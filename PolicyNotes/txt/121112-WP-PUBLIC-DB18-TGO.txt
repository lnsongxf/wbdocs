About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of
    the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0
    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                      While it is not a mandatory requirement to submit a survey plan to obtain a
                      building permit, in practice architects would hire the services of a surveyor
                      to check that property border to ensure that it is encroaching on another
                      property. Once the surveyor has veri ed the property borders, this survey
                      plan is then stamped by the Cadastre to con rm its authenticity. It will take
                      the surveyor about 1 week to prepare the survey plan (leve topographique)
                      and about a month to obtain the seal from the Cadastre, although
                      sometimes it can take up to 2 months for the Cadastre to con rm the survey

      Agency : Togolese Water Supply Company (TdE)

      The cost estimate of FCFA 800,000 includes both water connection and the
      cost of installing a septic tank.


      (i) Water connection Fees of FCFA 125,000 for a maximum length of 40
      meters using an HDPE pipe of 25mm. If the connection is over 40 meters,
      then it would require an extension of the network. Additional costs will be
      incurred according to the diameter of the existing pipe network (75mm to
      200mm). The cost also depends on the required length of network extension
      and the nature of the material of the pipe (PVC, HDPE, Cast).

      (ii) Sewage - Septic tank: Only a few streets of Lomé are connected to a
      sewage system. Therefore, it is common to have a septic tank installed. The
      cost of the septic tank depends on its size (i.e. the number of users). For the
      Doing Business case study, it is estimated that there will be between 5 - 10
      users. Therefore the cost will range from FCFA 350,000 - 650,000. There is no
      need for an additional authorization to build a septic tank.

    Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

of tari index.

If the duration and frequency of outages is not available, or is over 100, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.

If the minimum outage time considered for SAIDI/SAIFI is over 5 minutes, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.




    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      The law requires that the sale agreement be notarized. It is the practice that
                                                                                                               2 500 001 - 5, 000 000

      The sale agreement should be registered with the tax authorities. An o ce
      of the O ce Togolais des Recettes was opened in the Direction des A aires
      Domaniales et Cadastrales. The sale agreement registration fees would
      amount to 6% of the sale value, plus stamp duties. The cost is XOF 1,000 per
      stamp. The typical sale agreement takes ve pages, hence ve stamps. The
      Tax Authorities have di erent criteria to value the property (zone,
      characteristic of the land, etc.) and can request higher registration amounts
      if they assess that the sale value is understated.

      The parties return the sale agreement duly registered with the tax

      The parties or the notary acting on their behalf, can now take the notarized
      sale agreement to the Land Registry and le a request of transfer of
      property. It is added to the request copy of the former “Titre Foncier”. The
      law supposes that the Registry’s authorities send employees to the property
      for a eld inspection. However, this is never done in practice, especially when
      the sale covers 100% of the property. If the sale covers only part of the
      property, a eld inspection is required and usually carried to assess the new
      boundaries of the Land and update the registry. The Registrar can either
      refuse to accept the le for technical reasons or accept it. Once the le has
      been accepted, it will be allocated a case number which will allow follow-ups.

       a copy of the transcription.

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the             - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                         and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                   (after an          declaration of cessation of payments (article 1-3 and 25 of the Uniform Act Organizing

                                      creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court will convert the
                                      proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of the proposal (article 33 of the
                                      Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that is later converted into liquidation is the most
                                      likely proceeding in Togo.

Outcome            piecemeal sale     According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the proceedings will
                                      probably be converted to liquidation. The hotel will stop operating and will be dismantled,
                                      and the assets of the debtor will be sold separately.

Time (in years)    3.0                Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of
                                      reorganization proceedings. The declaration has to be done 30 days following the cessation
                                      of payments. The competent court will then declare cessation of payments and open
                                      reorganization proceedings. The composition proposal will fail, so the proceedings will be
                                      converted to liquidation. According to our estimations, the complete process of a
                                      reorganization attempt that is then converted to liquidation takes approximately 36 months.

Cost (% of         15.0               According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted into
estate)                               liquidation costs approximately XOF 15,400,000 (15% of the value of the estate). The following
                                      cost components are applicable: lawyer fees (10%), fees of the expert-rapporteur and official
                                      receiver appointed under articles 8 and 35.
