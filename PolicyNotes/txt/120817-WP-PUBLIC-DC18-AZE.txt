About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Under the law, the sale-purchase agreement and the transfer and
      acceptance act duly signed by both parties must be notarized. In order to get
      the agreement notarized the seller must provide evidence of his title to the
      property, i.e. registration certi cates . In addition to the above, both the
      seller and the buyer must provide the notary public with other documents
      certifying their powers to enter into the sale-purchase agreement (e.g.
      corporate documents, powers of attorney). There is no legal requirement for
      the agreement to be prepared by a lawyer. Accordingly, the parties are free
      to prepare the agreement themselves. The stamp duty is paid to the notary,
      which in turn he shall transfer to the Treasury within two banking days since
      the date of receipt of the duty. However, in practice the stamp duty can be
      paid at a commercial bank. If the parties pay at the bank, receipt of payment
      should be submitted.
      The documentation shall include:
      • Sale-purchase agreement and transfer and acceptance act
      • Registration certi cates
      • Seller’s cadastral package of documents

                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

     stay and/or sets a time limit for it?

     Does the law allow parties to agree on out of court enforcement at the time a security interest is created? Does the law              No
     allow the secured creditor to sell the collateral through public auction or private tender, as well as, for the secured
     creditor to keep the asset in satisfaction of the debt?

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator             Answer           Explanation

Proceeding            foreclosure      BizBank will initiate foreclosure proceeding, because it is cheaper and faster than insolvency
                                       proceeding. Additionally, secured creditors have the right to enforce their security interest
                                       even if other parties (debtor, unsecured creditors) start insolvency proceedings.

Outcome               piecemeal sale   It will be difficult to find a buyer willing to purchase the hotel as a going concern.

Time (in years)       1.5              Before BizBank can initiate foreclosure proceedings, it must give at least two months after
                                       the debtor fails to pay and then give one month notice of default to the debtor. The debtor
                                       or any other interested party may appeal the notice of default in the court within 21 days
                                       from the date of service. The creditor must register the notice of default with the State
                                       Register Service of Immovable Property within 7 days from its service upon the debtor. Once
                                       the notice of default is registered, BizBank may apply to a court for a judgment to foreclose
                                       upon the secured assets. During a preliminary hearing (0.5-1 month after filing), the judge
                                       reviews material and accepts Bizbank's case for consideration. A hearing will take place
                                       where Mirage and BizBank will present their claims. The court will issue a decision in Bank’s
                                       favor within several months. Mirage will likely appeal the decision (within 30 days), and the
                                       appeal will be decided within a few months and the decision becomes effective immediately.
                                       Within 3 days of receipt of the effective court judgment, the court bailiff must send an order
                                       on foreclosure to a specialized auctioneer. The entire adjudication process will take about 1
                                       year. After that, a specialized auctioneer must publish two announcements – 30 days and 15
                                       days before the proposed public auction sale. The first auction requires that the property be
                                       sold for at least 70% of the starting price. The second auction allows the sale of the
                                       foreclosed property at a price which covers the auction expenses and the secured
                                       obligations to the mortgagee and any senior mortgagee(s). In our case, it is likely that there
                                       will be two auctions, as it will not be easy to find a buyer. The entire process will take
                                       approximately 6 months until the proceeds are paid to BizBank.

Cost (% of            12.0             The total cost of the proceedings would amount to approximately 12% of the value of the
estate)                                estate. Main expenses will include attorneys' fees - around 5%; fees of the auctioneer -
                                       around 4%; and fees of accountants and other professionals involved in the case - around
                                       3%.
