About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      A topographical survey provides all the details of a land plot’s built ability.
      For example, the land plot’s building potential and limitations, plot ratios,
      site coverage, height and other legal requirements. A topographical survey is
      required to obtain building permission in Greece.

  4   Obtain active re protection approval                                                 10 days            no charge
      Agency : Fire Brigade

      In order to obtain the re protection approval, a certi ed engineer must
      complete a study stating what needs to be done and this study must be
      accompanied by technical drawings of the warehouse.


      According to legislation 4156/2013, the building engineer is entirely
      responsible for the re safety of the new building, but in practice, the Fire
      Department still reviews the plans and issues the re safety certi cate.

      According to the Doing Business case study, it is assumed that BuildCo has
      an engineer among its sta ; therefore no additional cost is paid.

      Agency : Athens Water and Sewerage Company (EYDAP)

      EYDAP veri es that the building can be connected to a local water supply and
      sewerage network. There is no need for an o cial Environmental Impact
      Study in Greece for a small warehouse that does not store dangerous or
      toxic materials. However, there is a consideration that must be addressed
      regarding proper road availability for the warehouse operation. A tra c
      control study in the initial phase might be required to ensure that the
      warehouse operation will not burden the tra c.

   7   Obtain proof of advanced payment to the Social Security                           2 days    no charge
       Agency : Social Security (IKA)

       Social security is based on the size of the building which will provide for an
       approximate number of working days and the minimum pay for each worker.


       The law requires each individual building project to be subjected to a pre-
       assessment and payment of expected social security expenses as a pre-
       condition to apply for a building permit. This rule often involves repeated
       transactions with the Social Security until the proof of payment is obtained
       and the investor can move on with the project.


       In the Doing Business case study, the minimum pay is estimated at EUR
       61.00 for 693 working days. The estimated cost of Social Security to be paid
       by the owner of the company is around EUR 25,000.00.

   8   Request and obtain initial permit/approval from the Municipality                  16 days   no charge
       Agency : Municipality

       At this point the builder’s architect submits general drawings of the building,
       topographic plan, and ownership documents to the Municipality. The
       Municipality’s engineer reviews the drawings and if everything is in order, the
       Municipality issues an initial permit/approval to the builder. This permit does
       not allow the builder to start construction. The permit is valid for one year,
       during which the builder must submit detailed engineering drawings.

   9   Request and obtain building permit from the Municipality                          15 days   EUR 12,329
       Agency : Municipality

       BuildCo submits detailed architectural, mechanical, structural drawings to
       the Municipality. The Municipality simply checks that all plans have been
       submitted and les them but does not review them for accuracy because
       under the amended regulations, the responsibility for the plans lies with the
       engineer. The Municipality simply accepts the documentation for their
       records.

       At this point, the municipal tax of 1.5% of warehouse value must be paid as
       well as other fees such as the health insurance of the workers. The proof of
       payment of the Social Security must be submitted when requesting the
       permit. Once the Municipality checks that all plans are submitted and all fees
       have been paid, the building permit is issued to the applicant.


       Under Law Act 3919/2011 (Principle of professional freedom, abolition of
       unjusti ed restrictions on access to and pursuit of professions) Article 7,
       there is no minimum pay for any work or design performed by an engineer.
       It is up to the discretion of the engineer to charge whatever fee he wants for
       his work.


       Based on this law, the estimated fee for the design and the supervision
       according to the minimum pay is around EUR 35,000.00. With a 20% discount
       the nal fee is EUR 28,000.00. However, according to the Doing Business case
       study assumptions, BuildCo has an architect, a civil engineer and a
       mechanical engineer as part of its sta . Therefore, no additional cost is
       recorded.

       Under the new law, ACT 7533/2013, Article 2, the municipality must issue the
       building permit within two days if all of the documents have been correctly
       submitted. In practice, this takes up to 30 days.
                                                                                                                Page 14

       The rst inspection is at the foundation level right after the excavation is
       done.

       Inspections are requested in person at the Municipality by the builder (or the
       builder’s architect or engineer). It is possible to request the inspections
       electronically as the application is available online and can be sent to the
       Municipality via email; however, the current practice is a visit to the
       Municipality.


       BuildCo completes a form with basic information (e.g. location, total area of
       the building, etc.) and submits it to an employee at the Municipality. Usually
       it is the same person who issued the building permit; there are several
       persons in charge and they are assigned to di erent areas of the city. The
       Municipality then sends the le to the Ministry of Environment, Energy and
       Climate Change, which conducts a lottery among the certi ed engineers they
       have on le, and gives the name of the inspector to the Municipality. The
       Municipality then informs BuildCo about who the inspector will be.

      Apply for water and sewage connection                                              1 day                      EUR 61
 16   Agency : Athens Water and Sewerage Company (EYDAP)

      BuildCo submits a request for a new connection and pays a fee of EUR 60.57.



      The request must be accompanied by a recent copy of the building permit,
      coverage diagram, and identi cation of the owner of the lot.

 17   Undergo investigation by EYDAP on the feasibility of the project                   21 days                    EUR 470
      Agency : Athens Water and Sewerage Company (EYDAP)

      EYDAP investigates the possibility of constructing the connection (checks
      network availability and determines meter size and the number of meters
      necessary) and informs BuildCo if extra costs are involved. Most connections
      cost EUR 470 (not including VAT tax and possible network extension). The
      investigation phase according to EYDAP regulations must be completed
      within one month. Once the customer pays the EUR 470, the connection
      work begins.

 18   Obtain water and sewage connection                                                 45 days                    EUR 600
      Agency : Athens Water and Sewerage Company (EYDAP)

      The water connection phase can be completed within 10-15 days but usually
      lasts about 3 months. This is because independent contractors construct
      the connections for EYDAP and they try to group the new connection
      requests and send personnel and heavy equipment out to construct
      multiple connections in a speci c area at a time. It is not nancially viable for
      them to construct connections according to the order in which they are
      requested.


      In Greece sewage connections are constructed by the Municipality and
      turned over to EYDAP for operation. According to article 13 of Law 1068/80,
      the customer must pay a fee for the network construction and a fee for the
      house connection. House connections cost on average EUR 600 - 1500 per
      lot and this amount is divided by all the stakeholders. Hence for an
      apartment building with many apartments the cost is divided among all the
      apartment owners while in the example of the warehouse the amount will be
      paid in full by the owner of the building.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       between the price the seller had paid to obtain the property and the amount
       he/she receives when selling the same property), is subject to the 15%
       capital gains tax. According to the provisions of Article 43 of the latest
       Income Tax Code, if the seller is a natural person, this tax equals to 15% of
       the above described income from the property transfer. In this case the tax
       is collected in advance by the notary, who shall pay it to the Tax Authority.

       the new Income Tax Code the legal entity shall include the price of the
       property transfer at the end of the nancial year to its income declaration

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer               Explanation

Proceeding          liquidation          Mirage management will commence pre-bankruptcy rehabilitation proceedings. At the same
                    (after an            time, the bank can file the petition for opening the liquidation proceedings. Once
                    attempt at           rehabilitation proceedings begin, bankruptcy proceedings initiated by the bank will be
                    reorganization)      suspended for the duration of rehabilitation. Mirage management must propose a
                                         reorganization plan and negotiate it with the creditors before it is proposed to the court. In
                                         the case of Mirage, the plan will most likely be rejected by the creditors (in particular the
                                         bank), because this procedure is new and creditors are not comfortable with accepting such
                                         plans. After the plan is rejected, BizBank will initiate liquidation proceedings.

Outcome             piecemeal sale       Unless reorganization plan is approved, the company will most likely stop operating and its
                                         assets will be sold piecemeal. Given the poor market condition, it will be very difficult to sell
                                         the company as a going concern.

Time (in years)     3.5                  Mirage management will commence pre-bankruptcy rehabilitation proceedings. The debtor
                                         will have to negotiate and propose a rehabilitation plan within 2 months of when the
                                         proceedings are filed. This period may be extended. The debtor may request a mediator to
                                         help in negotiations with the creditors. If the plan is submitted to the court, the court can
                                         take 4-6 months to assess the rehabilitation plan and make a decision. In the case of Mirage,
                                         rehabilitation is not likely to be successful. It is a new procedure and creditors and courts are
                                         not completely comfortable with it yet. Very few companies have been actually rehabilitated
                                         through this procedure. After rehabilitation fails, BizBank is likely to initiate bankruptcy
                                         proceedings. An administrator will be appointed to manage Mirage’s assets. It may take time
                                         to find an administrator, as there are not many qualified candidates for this position right
                                         now. The creditors will submit their claims and the administrator will prepare a list of
                                         creditors’ claims. After the list is finalized, a creditors’ meeting will be held, where the
                                         creditors will decide whether to reorganize or liquidation Mirage. The creditors are likely to
                                         choose liquidation, because that is the quickest way to receive the money, and ask the
                                         administrator to sell Mirage’s assets. The assets will be sold through a public auction. The
                                         most likely time estimate for the bankruptcy proceedings is 3 years.

Cost (% of          9.0                  Major expenses will include attorneys' fees (up to EUR 60,000 or around 3% of the value of

                                         of the estate), remuneration of the administrator (EUR 18,500 or 1% of the value of the
                                         estate) and fees of the auctioneer (up to EUR 37,000 or around 2% of the value of the estate).
