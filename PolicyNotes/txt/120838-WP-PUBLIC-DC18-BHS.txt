About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       On 1 January, 2015, the Value Added Tax Act (the "VAT Act") came into e ect
       in The Bahamas. The VAT Act requires all persons, including companies,
       carrying on a business with an annual turnover of B$100,000 or more, or
       who have reasonable grounds to expect that the business will obtain an
       annual turnover of B$100,000 or more, to register with the VAT Department
       of the Ministry of Finance. VAT registrants are required charge and collect
       VAT at a rate of 7.5% on the supply of all goods and services (except goods
       and services which are exempt or zero-rated under the VAT Act) and remit
       the VAT collected to the Government of The Bahamas. In addition, persons
       meeting the registration threshold will be required to submit returns to the
       VAT Department on a monthly or quarterly basis.

       Business are able to register for VAT at the same time as registering for the
       business license. In order to register for VAT the company must register
       within 14 days of commencing business if it is anticipated that it will meet the
       annual turnover threshold of B$100,000. The application for registration
       must be submitted through the VAT Department's Online Tax Administration
       System (OTAS): vat.revenue.gov.bs, which will require the company to create
       a free online user account and complete and submit the VAT Registration

       On 1 January, 2015, the Value Added Tax Act (the "VAT Act") came into e ect
       in The Bahamas. The VAT Act requires all persons, including companies,
       carrying on a business with an annual turnover of B$100,000 or more, or
       who have reasonable grounds to expect that the business will obtain an
       annual turnover of B$100,000 or more, to register with the VAT Department
       of the Ministry of Finance. VAT registrants are required charge and collect
       VAT at a rate of 7.5% on the supply of all goods and services (except goods
       and services which are exempt or zero-rated under the VAT Act) and remit
       the VAT collected to the Government of The Bahamas. In addition, persons
       meeting the registration threshold will be required to submit returns to the
       VAT Department on a monthly or quarterly basis.

       Business are able to register for VAT at the same time as registering for the
       business license. In order to register for VAT the company must register
       within 14 days of commencing business if it is anticipated that it will meet the
       annual turnover threshold of B$100,000. The application for registration
       must be submitted through the VAT Department's Online Tax Administration
       System (OTAS): vat.revenue.gov.bs, which will require the company to create
       a free online user account and complete and submit the VAT Registration
       Application. Once the VAT Department has approved the registration, which
       takes between 3 and 14 days, it will issue a Certi cate of Registration to the
       company, which must be displayed in all locations where the company
       conducts business.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       Agency : Registry of Records

       It generally takes three months for the Registry of Records to record a
       property transfer and return the supporting documentation after it has
       been led for recording. In order to le for registration, the a davits of the
       witnesses to the convayance have to be notarized. This Procedure is not
       necessary for the validity of the conveyance, but it is a requirement under
       the Registration of Records Act (Ch. 187 Statute Laws of The Bahamas, 2000
       Edition) to record the transfer. Any licenced notary public can do it at a cost
       of BSD 30.00 to BSD 50.00, and in most cases lawyers have a notary public
       licence, in which case they may do it themselves. In this case, the fee is
       included in the lawyer's overall fees charged in Procedure 1.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                      Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if

                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding         receivership         According to Section 139 of the Companies Act - Chapter 308, BizBank, as a debenture
                                        holder, is entitled to realize its security interest and appoint a receiver of any assets of a
                                        company pursuant to the instrument creating the debenture. After Mirage's default on
                                        payment, BizBank would initiate receivership by appointing a receiver to take charge of
                                        Mirage's business, receive the income deriving from the hotel property, pay the liabilities
                                        connected with the property and attempt sell Mirage as a going concern to maximize the
                                        return.

Outcome            going concern        Yes, the hotel will continue operating as a going concern after the receiver will sell Mirage as
                                        a going concern to a third party.

Time (in years)    3.0                  A receivership procedure would take approximately 3 years in total. The delay is largely due
                                        to the time it takes to find a potential buyer in the market. The main procedural steps are as
                                        follows:- 1) Debenture holder realizes the security interest and appoints a receiver; 2) Holder
                                        gives notice within ten (10) days to the Registrar, causing the same to be filed at the Registry;
                                        3) Receiver then sends notice to the company of its appointment; 4) Within fourteen (14)
                                        days after receipt of notice, a statement is prepared by the company and submitted to the
                                        receiver. Such statement pertains to the affairs of the company, pursuant to Section 151 of
