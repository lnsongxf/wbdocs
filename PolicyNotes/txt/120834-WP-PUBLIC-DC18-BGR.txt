About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      The Law on Environment Protection (Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) de nes the
      investment projects that are subject to an environmental impact
      assessment (EIA). The warehouse building for storing books and stationary
      does not fall among the investment projects listed in both appendices. Thus,
      the EIA is not obligatory. However, a decision issued by the Director of the
      Regional Inspectorate of Protection of Environment is required to con rm
      that EIA is not necessary. The decision is issued within 14 days of submitting
      the request. The decision is valid for 5 years.

      The design of the external connection is prepared in accordance with the
      Ordinance № 6 of 24.02.2014, art. 21, which states that for connections to
      the medium-voltage the preparation of the design and the construction of
      the connection are undertaken by the customer’s design company. The
      design has to correspond to the technical requirements set forth by the Law
      of Spatial Planning (LSP) of 31.03.2001.
      The design company on behalf of the customer submits the design for
      approval to the utilities/agencies whose communication lines and activities
      may be a ected by the new connection (e.g. water, gas, heating, telecoms,
       re department, etc.). In practice, several copies of the document are
      prepared to be sent to all agencies simultaneously in order to save time.
      Once the design has been approved by relevant agencies/utilities, it has to
      be approved by CEZ Distribution.

       The customer signs a contract for pavement recovery with the Municipality
       to guarantee that the pavement will be recovered upon completion of the
       external works (as it involves excavating under the road/pavement). In
       parallel, the customer pays a deposit, which will be reimbursed 20% per year
       over a period of ve years if no damages to the pavement are observed.
       There are no interests paid on this deposit. The conditions of the guarantee
       contract and deposit are regulated by the Municipality.
       Once the contract for pavement recovery has been signed and the deposit
       paid the Municipality can grant the construction permit for the connection.
       Within the deadlines set by the Law of Spatial Planning (art. 144(3) and art.
       148(4)), the Municipality approves the design and issues the construction.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

  7   Registration of notarized deed at the Registry                                    10 days   Already paid in
      Agency : Registration Agency                                                                Procedure 6


      The notary will register the notarized deed at the registration o ce with the
      respective district court. This can be done by the parties too, but it is most
      common that the notary will do it (and it is included in the above fees). The
      notary will pay registration and state fees collected previously. Registration
      should take 1 day, but it can take up to 3 days during busy periods.



      According to Art.25, para 5 of the Notary Public and Notarial Activity Law of
      2009 (last amendment of the Notary Public and Notarial Activity Act was
      promulgated in State Gazette, issue 82 of 16 October 2009,
      http://dv.parliament.bg/DVWeb/broeveList.faces), the notary now has to
      submit the notarized deed in the same day it is signed. In practice, this
      generally happens in Sophia.



      The notarized deed will be registered by the Notary Public with the
      respective o ce of the Registry Agency. The Notary Public and Notarial
      Activity Law last amended by State Gazette issue 82 of October 21, 2011.



      If a notary public does not perform their obligation for entry of a notary
      deed or other notary certi ed act with the real estate register, the interested
      persons are entitled to claim the su ered damages. Furthermore, the
      interested persons may address the Notary Chamber regarding the
      violations of the notary's obligations. This may entail disciplinary
      proceedings against the respective notary public.



      This amendment also ensures that the notaries public have access to the
      National Database "Population" and to the National Automatic Information
      Fund for personal identity documents. It also introduced an obligation for
      the notaries public to make special checks in the database and the fund
      when performing notary certi cations connected to rights over real estates.

      of the competent Municipality
      Agency : Local Taxes and Fees Department at the respective Municipality

      According to Art. 14 of the LTFA, for any newly acquired property, the owner
      is obliged to submit a declaration to the municipal authorities, where the
      property is located. The owner must attach a copy of his ownership title
      (notary deed, etc.) to the declaration before ling it.


      The new owner must submit a declaration before the municipal authorities
      within 2 months as of the date of acquisition of the property. The purpose of
      the declaration is to indicate the new owner of the real estate before the
      municipal authorities with regard to the calculation of the local tax for
      owning of a real estate and the waste tax that are due according to Art. 10
      and Art. 62 of the LTFA.

                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator            Answer              Explanation

Proceeding           liquidation          Mirage management must initiate insolvency proceedings when the state of insolvency is
                                          discovered. Mirage may propose a restructuring plan (within 30 days), however, acceptance
                                          of this plan is not very likely. Hence, the court will declare Mirage bankrupt and initiate
                                          liquidation proceedings.

Outcome              piecemeal sale       As a result of the liquidation proceedings, Mirage will be liquidated and its assets will be sold
                                          piecemeal. Very few companies survive insolvency proceedings as a going concern.

Time (in years)      3.3                  Bizbank will first declare the default of Mirage in written form and will invite it to pay the debt.
                                          Mirage management will file for bankruptcy with the appropriate court. The court will
                                          appoint an expert witness, who will give an opinion on the economical state of Mirage. The
                                          court will appoint hearing of the expert witness and later will declare the insolvency of
                                          Mirage with a decision starting the bankruptcy proceedings. The period between filing for
                                          bankruptcy and the decision takes 3-12 months. The court will schedule a date for the first
                                          meeting of the creditors and invite them to file their claims. The invitation will be published
                                          online on the website of the Commercial Registry. The creditors must file their claims within
                                          a month, but can have an extension of 2 months to file their claims. If they miss the deadline,
                                          they cannot file their claims. At the first meeting, the creditors will choose a permanent
                                          official receiver (called "syndik") and the creditor's committee will be established. The syndik
                                          will review the claims, decide which of them have grounds and file a list of the accepted
                                          claims and another list of the unaccepted claims with the court and in the Commercial
                                          Registry. The creditors may object against the lists. The court will review the objections and
                                          will decide which of them have grounds. This process can take about 5 months. Mirage may
                                          propose a reorganization plan within 30 days after the final list of claims has been published.
                                          If there is such plan, a second meeting of the creditors should be scheduled, where creditors
                                          will vote for the plan. Bizbank will reject the plan, as it is a privileged creditor and will get all
                                          the money from the public sale. This process can take 5 months or longer. After rejecting the
                                          plan, the court will declare Mirage bankrupt and will start the procedure of turning the
                                          assets of Mirage into cash. One or two public sales will be held for the hotel and one or two
                                          public sales for the rest of the property (including the movable assets like furniture, etc.). If
                                          the syndik does not succeed in selling the property at the public sales, he will sell the
                                          property directly, without a public sale, after the court's approval. After turning the assets
                                          into cash, he will prepare lists of amounts to be distributed among the creditors. The
                                          creditors may appeal before the court against the lists. Meanwhile, the syndik must collect all
                                          amounts owed to Mirage by its debtors (if there are any). When no assets are left, the official
                                          receiver will prepare a final report to the court and the creditors, and a final meeting of the
                                          creditors will be held. The court will declare the end of the procedure and will erase Mirage
                                          from the Commercial Registry. The sale process can take about 15 months.

Cost (% of           9.0                  The cost of the liquidation procedure would amount to approximately 9% of the value of the
estate)                                   hotel. The cost would mainly include: attorneys’ fees - 3%, fees of the bankruptcy trustee
                                          (syndik) - about 4%, and fees of accountants and other experts - 2%.
