About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      BuildCo will request a soil test for the structural calculations for the
      foundation. Contractors ask for a soil test to ensure that the foundation of
      the building is solid. The engineer must understand the suitability of the soil
      for the proposed construction work. It allows to build a solid foundation and
      avoid structures to be damaged or collapsed or leaned.

       No 162, Tomo No 380 from September 1st 2008, the warehouse in the Doing
       Business case study would fall under Category 'A' which is exempt from an
       Environmental Impact Study. In this case, all that is required is for the
       architect or engineer to ll out an Environmental Form and submit it to
       MARN (Ministry of Environment). The Form outlines the project and its
       potential environmental impact. MARN will then decide if the work can be
       considered exempt from the full impact study. In the Doing Business case
       study, the project would most likely be exempt from the full impact study.

      Agency : AES El Salvador

      An external site inspection is conducted to determine the feasibility of the
      project and the adequate connection point. It is recommended that a
      representative of the applicant be present during the inspection.

      Agency : Sub-contratista

      Once the customer has received the approved plans, the client can start
      preparing the works that fall under his responsibility. He will install the
      transformers and poles (if needed) and prepare the cables that the utility will
      later connect to the meter, etc. The time estimate for this procedure
      includes the wait time to obtain the relevant material.

      Customers have the choice of paying for this investment themselves and
      getting in return a lower consumption tari or asking the utility to bear the
      investment and paying a higher consumption tari later on. Most costumers                                                   Page 24

   4   The deed is presented to the Registry o        ce for registration                     14-28 days (10-20      Already paid in
       Agency : Immovable Property and Mortgages Registry (Registro de la                     working days)          procedure 3
       Propiedad Raíz e Hipotecas)

       The public deed is submitted at the Immovable Property and Mortgages
       Registry to be recorded under the name of the buyer. The deed will be
       registered, if it meets all the legal requirements, in 2 - 4 weeks. The registry
       has to check with the Ministry of Finance ("Hacienda") if the parties are Tax
       solvent. In addition to reforms at the registry set out by the Law on Standard
       Procedures of August 2004, an electronic system is currently being
       introduced and, once fully functional, is expected to reduce the registration
       time. In addition, a special service is available (mainly used by banks, law
         rms or companies). Since May 2016, a new fast track service is available in
       order to register property transfer in 2 days in exchange for a premium
       payment (40 USD plus VAT). However, the majority of practitioners in San
       Salvador still use the default procedure to register property transfers.

   5   The public deed is led at the respective Municipality                                  1-5 days               USD 0.06 for every
       Agency : Municipality                                                                                         USD 114.29 of the
                                                                                                                     property value
       This is done in order to update the information at the Municipality and for
                                                                                                                     declared in the deed
       calculation on municipal taxes. The title is already valid even if not led at the
       Municipality. The incentive to le the public deed lies on the old owner, who
       will have to continue paying the taxes on the property if this is not done.

       Depending on the municipality, this step can take from 1 to 5 days. In San
       Salvador, the municipality has o ces in each district. If someone goes to
       district 1 to register a property that is located on district 4, the registry
       process can take about 5 days, because the documents of the property are
       in district 4, but if going directly to district 4, the registry process takes about
       1 to 2 days.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the              - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                          and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                              economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                             - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                             - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                           equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                   - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                             commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                             - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                      - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                     - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                       - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                             movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                        the creditor would request the payment by filing a claim before the court. The debtor would
                                        have the opportunity to counter-claim. After that an approval to initiate foreclosure will be
                                        handed down by the Court and an order to set up an auction will be issued. Once the time
                                        allocated by law for appeal lapses, the court would appoint an auctioneer to sell the debtor's
                                        assets pledged as collateral in a public auction. The Court would subsequently validate the
                                        distribution of the debtor’s assets among the creditors.

Outcome               piecemeal sale    Because of the sale of the property through a public auction the hotel won’t be able to
                                        continue operating and its assets will be sold separately.

Time (in years)       3.5               The foreclosure proceeding will take approximately 3.5 years in El Salvador from the moment
                                        of Mirage’s default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor. It will take 1 year until the
                                        approval to initiate foreclosure is handed down by the Court including all required
                                        notifications and the debtor’s counter-claim. After that, it would take 2 years for the auction
                                        to take place (including the necessary time to appoint an auctioneer, the scheduling of the
                                        auction and the sale of the real estate). It will take additional 6 months for the judge to
                                        approve the sale.

Cost (% of            12.0              For a foreclosure proceeding, the estimate cost would be 12% of the value of Mirage’s estate.
estate)                                 The main component of the cost are the attorney’s fees (8%). The rest (3%) will be appraisal
                                        and auctioneer’s fees and fees of other professionals such as accountants (1%). In El
                                        Salvador, there are not judicial costs or cost related to service, since free access to justice is
                                        assured by the Constitution.
