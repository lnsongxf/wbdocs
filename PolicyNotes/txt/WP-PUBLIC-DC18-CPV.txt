About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of
    the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0
    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                      The plot map must be recent (no older than one year). To produce the plot
                      map, the Municipality must send an expert to the actual plot. Each
                      neighborhood is assigned a speci c day for this type of work. The
                      neighborhood in Praia where the warehouse is likely to be is in Achada

No.   Procedure                                                                         Time to Complete          Associated Costs

  1   Request plot map from Municipality                                                29 days                   CVE 2,000
      Agency : Municipality

      The plot map must be recent (no older than one year). To produce the plot
      map, the Municipality must send an expert to the actual plot. Each
      neighborhood is assigned a speci c day for this type of work. The
      neighborhood in Praia where the warehouse is likely to be is in Achada
      Grande or Tira Chapeu, the more industrial parts of the city.


      Documents to be submitted are: Location plan (updated after 1 year), zone
      number, owner, and number of oors to be built. The plot map will show any
      tra c impact such as parking spaces needed.

      The Municipality issues this permit only if all tax charges have been paid. To
      prove that all taxes have been paid, BuildCo presents its IUP (Imposto Único
      sobre o Património) payment receipt. The IUP is a receipt for transfer of
      property, obtained when purchasing the property. This is a one-time tax paid
      on any transfer of property, valued at 3% of the property value.


      The entrepreneur requests the plot map. 15 days later, the Municipality
      sends an inspector to the site. 4 to 5 days after the inspection, the
      Municipality issues a second plot map that must be signed by the Secretary
      Director. One week to 10 days later BuildCo pays the fee and obtains the plot
      map.

      Agency : Property Registry

      BuildCo. can request the property title. However, one needs the municipal
      plot map for enabling this procedure. For this reason this procedure cannot
      be simultaneous with the previous one.

  3   Receive inspection from Municipality to obtain plot map                           1 day                     no charge
      Agency : Municipality

      The inspection can be conducted independently of the request for the plot
      map. For this reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the
      previous one.

  4   Submit and obtain approval of architectural plans from Municipality               15 days                   CVE 20,000
      Agency : Municipality

      The architectural plans can be completed by any registered architect. There
      is no requirement to hire an architect with any special license to draw the
      plans. After the architectural plans are completed, the architect usually
      submits two copies to the City Hall for approval, along with the plot map and
      a statement from the architect who produced the plans.


      In most cases, the submitted plans do not comply fully with regulations;
      back-and-forth discussions ensue between the Municipality and the
      architect. On average, the plans are resubmitted two or three times. The
      plans are reviewed by di erent municipal departments. After the plans are
      approved, the company must collect them at the City Hall and pay the                                                        Page 13

  4   Submit and obtain approval of architectural plans from Municipality                15 days   CVE 20,000
      Agency : Municipality

      The architectural plans can be completed by any registered architect. There
      is no requirement to hire an architect with any special license to draw the
      plans. After the architectural plans are completed, the architect usually
      submits two copies to the City Hall for approval, along with the plot map and
      a statement from the architect who produced the plans.


      In most cases, the submitted plans do not comply fully with regulations;
      back-and-forth discussions ensue between the Municipality and the
      architect. On average, the plans are resubmitted two or three times. The
      plans are reviewed by di erent municipal departments. After the plans are
      approved, the company must collect them at the City Hall and pay the
      approval fee. In the past, the approval fee depended on the number of pages
      in the approval le. Now the fee varies by type of project. From October 2012,
      there is an o cial 15-day time limit for the Municipality to approve the
      architectural plans. One needs the municipal inspection for enabling this
      procedure. For this reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the
      previous one.



  5   Submit and obtain approval of structural plans from Municipality                   7 days    CVE 20,000
      Agency : Municipality

      The company must submit the plans along with an a davit from the
      responsible engineer. The utility plans (water, sewage, electricity) are
      submitted at a later stage -- during or at the end of construction -- to Electra
      (the utility provider). After the plans are approved, the company must collect
      them at the City Hall and pay the approval fee. In the past, the approval fee
      depended on the number of pages in the approval le. Now the fee varies by
      the type of project. One needs to submit the architectural plans rst. For this
      reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the previous one.

  6   Request and obtain building permit                                                 7 days    CVE 75,000
      Agency : Municipality

      The company must submit a form requesting the permit. The same form can
      be used for a new construction or for an extension of an existing permit. This
      form includes the dates of approval of architectural and structural plans, the
      information about the land owner, and the information about the
      responsible architect or engineer. The fee is based on the construction
      project’s size, tra c impact, and duration (3, 6, or 12 months). BuildCo. can
      only activate this procedure once the plans have been handed. For this
      reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the previous one.

  7   Receive a pre-construction visit                                                   1 day     no charge
      Agency : Municipality

      An o cer from the Municipality visits the plot and marks the location of the
      construction before the work starts. It may take 30 days for the Municipality
      to inspect because it inspects only once a week and there is a limit to the
      number of site inspections that can be done per week. BuildCo must display
      its permit in a visible location during construction. BuildCo. can receive the
      pre-inspection once the building permit was obtained. For this reason this
      procedure cannot be simultaneous with the previous one.

  8   Receive a random inspection by Municipality                                        1 day     no charge
      Agency : Municipality
                                                                                                                Page 14  
      During construction, there are two types of inspection to check for: (1) the

       Agency : Municipality

       During construction, there are two types of inspection to check for: (1) the
       building permit was granted and (2) construction is being carried out
       according to the plan. Although the rst type is almost always done once, the
       second type hardly ever occurs barring a problem with construction.
       Likewise, the Labor Inspectorate inspects only after an accident happens.
       BuildCo. can receive the inspection once the pre-inspection visit was
       conducted. For this reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the
       previous one.

   9   Notify the Municipality about completion of construction and request             1 day     CVE 2,000
       occupancy permit
       Agency : Municipality

       If any changes are made to the initial approved plans, BuildCo submits a
       request with the re-drawn plans. The Municipality sets an inspection date.
       BuildCo. can only noti y the construction after it has been nalized. For this
       reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the previous one.

 10    Receive nal inspection from Municipality                                         1 day     no charge
       Agency : Municipality

       During the inspection over the course of a few hours, the entire building --
       plumbing, wood work, and so forth -- is checked to ensure it was completed
       according to the plan. The next day, BuildCo may collect the occupancy
       permit from the Municipality.


       BuildCo also applies for sewage connection with the Municipality. only after.
       For this reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the previous
       one.

 11    Obtain occupancy permit                                                          22 days   no charge
       Agency : Municipality

       An occupancy permit is required before BuildCo can request the utility
       connections. BuildCo. can receive the occupancy permit once the municipal
       inspection has been conducted. For this reason this procedure cannot be
       simultaneous with the previous one.

       Request water and sewage connection                                              1 day     CVE 50,000
 12    Agency : Electra

       For the utility connections, BuildCo must constantly follow up with the
       provider to get the connection on time. As a result, this procedure can be
       simultaneous.

 13    Receive water and sewage inspection                                              1 day     no charge
       Agency : Electra

       Inspection can only be conducted once it has been requested. So, this
       cannot be a simultaneous one.

 14    Obtain water and sewage connection                                               14 days   no charge
       Agency : Electra

       At this stage, BuildCo submits the water and sewage plans for approval. If the
       warehouse is not far from one of the water mains, the connection is made
       free of charge, and the user pays only for consumption. Normally, the
       company builds the connection up to the point at which it becomes free of                               Page 15

      Agency : Electra

      At this stage, BuildCo submits the water and sewage plans for approval. If the
      warehouse is not far from one of the water mains, the connection is made
      free of charge, and the user pays only for consumption. Normally, the
      company builds the connection up to the point at which it becomes free of
      charge (to save time and money). To get connected, the applicant must
      submit the certi cate of occupancy. However, in practice, consumers are
      connected without the occupancy permit.This procedure can only happen
      once the inspection has been conducted. so, it cannot be a simultaneous
      one.

 15   Agency : Property Registry

      BuildCo must register the building with the Property Registry if it wants to
      sell the property. This can happen in simultaneity with the water and sewage
      connections processes.

      Register the building at the Municipality (certidão matricial)                        7 days                      CVE 424,924

      The building registration fee is 3% of project value. This is an update of the
      existing registration of the land. BuildCo submits an application stating that
      there is a new building on the land so that the certi cate can be updated. As
      a result, this procedure can be simultaneous with the previous one.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
