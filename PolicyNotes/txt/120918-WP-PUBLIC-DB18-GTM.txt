About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

  2   Obtain project approval from the Ministry of Health                                     30 days              no charge
      Agency : Ministry of Health

      The Health Code of Guatemala 1997, requires that all constructions in
      Guatemala City need a clearance from the Ministry of Health to obtain a
      Construction License. This requirement was never implemented in practice
      till 2016.


      In January 2016, the Government of Guatemala started asking in practice for
      this clearance from the Ministry of Health, to issue a building permit.

      Agency : Independent Specialist

      The environmental assessment of minimum impact is generally prepared by
      a professional (engineer/architect) authorized to do so. BuildCo hires the
      professional and the cost will vary depending on the project's
      characteristics.

       Agency : One-Stop Shop under the Municipality of Guatemala City

       The Municipality of Guatemala City introduced a new Land Management Plan
       (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial- “POT”) as of January 7, 2009, and new
       building control regulations that also regulate the construction permit
       issuance. According to the new POT of Guatemala City the land use
       classi cations were changed based on the principles of sustainability,
       certainty, and better quality of life. In the old system the land was divided
       into industrial, residential, and commercial zones, whereas the new zoning
       regimes are established according to general use of land which among
       others introduced mixed use of zoning regimes. This tool was developed in
       consultation with both private and public sector and widely publicized. It also
       introduces a more sophisticated risk-based system of approval of
       construction permits.


       Before, the application had only one process of approval, whereby the
       application would be classi ed as complete and compliant with all
       requirements. This led to the issuance of construction permit. However, if
       incomplete it would need to be corrected.


       Under the new implementing regulations of POT this mechanism is based on
                                                                                                                Page 15

      Agency : One-Stop Shop under the Municipality of Guatemala City

      The Municipality of Guatemala City introduced a new Land Management Plan
      (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial- “POT”) as of January 7, 2009, and new
      building control regulations that also regulate the construction permit

      introduces a more sophisticated risk-based system of approval of
      construction permits.


      Before, the application had only one process of approval, whereby the
      application would be classi ed as complete and compliant with all
      requirements. This led to the issuance of construction permit. However, if
      incomplete it would need to be corrected.


      Under the new implementing regulations of POT this mechanism is based on
      three stages: Simpli ed Procedure (Precedimiento Directo); Approval of Land
      Management Council (Junta de Ordenamiento Territorial); Approval of Land
      Management Council and Neighbours’ Consent. Each phase is triggered if
      the previous phase is not complied with.


      BuildCo's case would fall into the ‘Simpli ed Procedure' scheme and does
      not require the subsequent procedure with Land Management Council and
      neighbors. Under this scheme if all requirements established in the
      regulations are satisfactory and complied with, the application would be
      approved in 10 working days.


      As of February 28, 2009 out of 580 applications for a new construction permit
      to the Central Territorial Directorate under the Municipality of Guatemala
      City (Direccion Central Territorial), 40% of cases underwent the simpli ed
      procedure and was approved within this time-limit. This procedure is
      administered under a newly operationalized single window principle.
      Additionally, the application forms have been substantially simpli ed and
      reduced in volume from 27 pages to 3 pages.


      BuildCo must submit the corresponding form with all the requested
      speci cs, together with all the requirements in the previous procedures,
      photocopies of the identi cation cards of its legal agent and the professional
      responsible for the construction, and a photocopy of the latest Single Real
      Estate Tax (Impuesto Unico sobre Inmueble) receipt and any other required
      receipts. An architect or engineer must be responsible for the construction
      work, signing the submitted form and the plans.

      All the information to obtain the construction license can now be submitted
      in a digital form.

      EMPAGUA
      Agency : One-Stop Shop under the Municipality of Guatemala City

      Once the construction is nalized, BuildCo must ll out the application at the
      one-stop shop and receive the requirements from the Water and Sewerage
      Authority (Empresa Municipal de Agua, EMPAGUA). EMPAGUA will notify
      BuildCo of the fee to be paid as a deposit to cover the completion of the
      procedure and a service feasibility study that must be carried out by
      EMPAGUA. EMPAGUA will start the feasibility study within about 15 days.

      In 2007 the Municipality of Guatemala uni ed the application forms and
      relevant requirements for EMPAGUA, Department of Urban Construction
      Control (Departamento de Control de Construcción Urbana) and
      Infrastructure Directorate (Dirección de Infraestructura).

      Another change is that the approvals from all these entities are given
      simultaneously. However, this has not had any practical impact on the
      ground.

      completion and return the license
      Agency : Construction Licensing Department (Departamento de Licencias de
      Construcción)

      The license must be returned to the Construction Licensing Department who
      performs the nal inspection. If the construction work conforms to approved
      speci cations, the occupancy permit is issued. When the license is returned,
      the Municipality noti es the Cadastre O ce about the construction and its
      cost. Within 7 -- 14 days, the Municipality visits the site to verify that the
      building complies with the approved speci cations.

      This procedure entails the reception of the water connection.

      Agency : One-Stop Shop under the Municipality of Guatemala City

      According to Article 78, upon completion of the construction work, the
      interested parties shall request a nal inspection from the Construction
      Licensing Department. This request can now be done at the one-stop shop.
      This inspection shall be performed by the supervisor in charge, who shall
      record the result on an inspection card. If the building does not comply with
      approved speci cations, the card must state the reasons and the
      appropriate remedies. If all aspects are in order and the card expressly
      states so, after the return of the respective license, the interested parties
      may request the building occupancy permit from the head of the o ce by
      completing the form stated in Annex 1 of the Regulation.

      If no objections are raised during the inspection (meaning that every part of
      the construction is authorized as complying with the plans submitted to the
      Construction Licensing Department), the professional in charge of the
      inspection may immediately go back to the o ce and issue the occupancy
      permit to be delivered to BuildCo. After that, BuildCo will be refunded its
      deposit of 0.01% of warehouse value that was paid at the stage of building
      permit approval.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.                                                         Page 17

      Agency : Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala S.A. (EEGSA)

      EEGSA performs an external inspection. The utility that the electrician in
      charge of the internal installations is present to clarify technical details. The
      visit consists of reviewing EEGSA's network and its interactions with the new
      user. There is no review of the user's internal wiring installation.


      During the inspection, the utility will verify that the voltage, capacity, and
      distance comply with the safety regulations.

      After EEGSA performs the external visit and checks the suitability of the
      connection's technical conditions, it will deliver a letter to the customer
      specifying the amount to be paid as a guarantee deposit and will con rm
      that the technical conditions are adequate to connect the warehouse to the
      grid.

      Agency : Empresa Electrica de Guatemala S.A.

      EEGSA will only provide its services once the client has signed the contract
      and paid the guarantee deposit. For loads above 100 kW, the deposit is not
      paid in cash but is covered by a bond issued by a guarantee agency in
      Guatemala. The guarantee deposit will be refunded when the customer no
      longer requires the service of the power supply (according to the General
      Electricity Law).

      As soon as the customer pays the deposit, he is able to sign the supply
      contract.

      For EEGSA to make the connection, it is needed that the civil works are
      completed. EEGSA is only responsible for the measuring equipment and
      therefore does not supervise the construction and laying of the cables, so
      the customer should contract the services of an independent engineer for
      this part of the works.

      therefore does not supervise the construction and laying of the cables, so
      the customer should contract the services of an independent engineer for
      this part of the works.

      The electrical engineer hired by the client installs the transformer, the pipe
      onto the post, the meter box, and the underground wiring to the main

      When the civil works are completed, the internal wiring are ready and the
      contract is signed, EEGSA installs the meter, transformers and connects the
      internal wiring to the transformers. The physical installation is performed by
      the Distributor (EEGSA) although subcontractors do the job. The electricity
      distribution company has a su cient stock of materials. The customer does
      not buy any materials for the external connection. The meter installation is
      simultaneous with the connection and the electricity begins to ow from the
      moment the connection is made. It is necessary to mount the transformer
      station, which involves installing a post and installing the metering
      equipment, all of this is paid by EEGSA.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      usually the lawyer who veri es the books at the registry and obtains this
      information. This updated certi cate of the property will be used later by the
      Notary to prepare the public deed.


      It is possible for the parties or the Notary to consult encumbrances, rights
      and privileges a ecting a property electronically through www.rpg.org.gt.
      However, most practitioners still request a non-encumbrance certi cate in
      paper format as the online information does not have the same legal e ect
      as a certi ed document issued by the Property Registry.


      The certi cate can be requested in person at the Property Registry, or can
      be requested by email. However, it has to be picked up in person.

  2   Obtain the cadastral value of the property from DICABI (Dirección de                    1 day                No cost
      Catastro y Avalúo de Bienes Inmuebles)                                                  (simultaneous with
      Agency : National Cadastre (Dirección de Catastro y Avalúo de Bienes                    procedures 1 and
      Inmuebles, DICABI)                                                                      3)

      In parallel to requesting a non-encumbrance certi cate at the Property
      Registry, the Notary must obtain a certi cate from the National Cadastre
      (Dirección de Catastro y Avalúo de Bienes Inmuebles, DICABI) indicating the
      cadastral value of the property.


      DICABI is a national institution containing information based on a “personal
      registry type” on all the regional registries in the country. Pursuant to
      amendments in Tax Law (Article 171 Decree 10-2012), authorized valuation of
      property and declaration of value of the real estate are mandatory.


      The request can be either submitted online, or at a speci c counter of the
      Superintendencia de Impuestos located in the Property Registry in
      Guatemala City. As of May 2017, the most common practice by Notaries is to
      request all the certi cates necessary to proceed with the property transfer
      physically at the di erent counters located in the Property Registry building.


      It is common for Notaries to pick up the DICABI certi cate once the non-
      encumbrance certi cate has been issued by the Property Registry.

       the market has driven prices for notary services down, one will likely pay
       between $800 and $1000 for such a transaction. The notary will oversee
       buying the State stamps for the Stamp Duty tax of 3% charged to second and
       subsequent sales of properties (this is assumed to be the case in the Doing
       Business scenario). For the rst sale of a property a VAT payment of 12% of
       the property value is paid. Stamps are adhered to the Public Deed. Payments
       of registration fees (GTQ.160.00 plus GTQ 1.5 for each GTQ 1,000 of
       transaction value) are made to the notary, who will then pay the property
       registry.

       The documentation requested by the notary shall include:


       (i) Updated non-encumbrance certi cate of the property issued by the
       Property Registry (Obtained in Procedure 1);

       (ii) Photocopy of the ID of seller and buyer (passport or local ID). In case the
       seller/buyer is a Company, a photocopy of the appointment in which the
       Company gives su cient faculties to proceed with the transfer of property is
       necessary. In some cases, a Board of Director´s resolution may be required;

       (iii) Cadastral value obtained at DICABI (Obtained in Procedure 2);


       (iv) Last receipt of payment of the property tax (Impuesto Único Sobre
       Inmuebles, IUSI);


       (v) Cadastral value obtained at the Municipality of Guatemala (Obtained in

   5   Public deed is delivered to the Property Registry for its recording               7 days               QTG 160 + 0.15% of
       Agency : Property Registry (Registro General de la Propiedad de Guatemala)                             transaction value
       (www.rgp.org.gt)                                                                                       (registration fees)

       The public deed is delivered to the Property Registry for its recording under
       the name of the buyer. It is also advisable to obtain a certi cate at the
       Property Registry to verify that the change of ownership has been properly
       recorded after registration is completed.

       The internal procedures conducted by the Property Registry are as follows:

       (1) All incoming cases are scanned and then assigned to the o cials
       (Operadores). Since 2005, an electronic system is fully implemented to
       randomly assign cases to o cials;


       (2) The o cial registers the property electronically; issues the case le
       (Expediente) and if the legal requirements are met, registers the transaction
       (Inscripción);

       (3) The Accounting Department veri es the payment of fees;

       (4) The Registrar or auxiliary registrars approve and sign the registration
       certi cate. With Decree 42-2006, electronic signatures from auxiliary
       registrars are legally valid. Each one is assigned a unique number by which
       they can electronically sign, facilitating the registration process;

       (5) The Archives Department prints the Inscription of the Property Transfer
       and prepares it for the user.

       It is also possible to verify the authenticity of the inscription of the
       transaction through www.rpg.org.gt (section “Validar razones registrales”).
       The buyer accesses to this information though a verifying code and a
       reference code previously given by the Property Registry.

   6   Notify the Municipality of the transaction                                        10 days              no cost

       Once the transaction is concluded the notary noti es the Municipality of
       Guatemala City of the change in ownership.


       This step is important to update the cadastral value of the property for tax
       collection purposes. There is a small ne if this procedure is not ful lled, but
       it has no e ect on the validity of the registration of the property transfer
       obtained in the previous step. The notary needs to provide a copy of the title
       deed together with the notice. She/he will follow up with the municipality
       until they receive a statement of the updated records showing the updated
       information regarding the ownership of the property.


       Since 2015, Notaries can notify the registration of property transfers to the
       Municipality of Guatemala City online. This system was updated in 2017.
       However, as of May 2017, the majority of Notaries are still communicating
       property transfers by courier to the Municipality.

                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding            foreclosure       A foreclosure would probably be the most likely procedure to apply, based on the Civil
                                        Procedure code, the Commercial Code and Decree 107 (Art. 294). In general, collective
                                        insolvency proceedings are less frequent than foreclosures in Guatemala. The foreclosure
                                        proceeding would take around 3 years. It would start with the creditor filing a claim before
                                        the court for the enforcement of the sale of the property used as a collateral. The debtor has
                                        to be personally notified about the claim. The debtor will have the opportunity to counter-
                                        claim. The claim has to be sent to the debtor’s home and he has to personally acknowledge
                                        the receipt of the claim. This can take a while, delays at this stage are very common. Once the
                                        debtor is finally reached, he has three days to object. Several rounds of objections are very
                                        common. Even though in “via de apremio” there are limits to the objections the debtor can
                                        make, it is common to face a lot of delays because of the objections. After that, it will take
                                        about 1.5 years until the approval to initiate foreclosure is handed down by the Court. Once
                                        the debtor finally accepts the claim, after several rounds of objections, the judge sets a time
                                        and date for the public auction. It can take around from 6 months to 1 year to organize and
                                        complete the auction. Also, it is not uncommon to organize several auctions because the
                                        hotel is not sold in the first one. Also, it is common that the debtor opposes how the hotel
                                        was valued. The public auction has to be published in the Diario Oficial at least three times,
                                        and also at the court (this will take a minimum of one month).

Outcome               piecemeal sale    Because of the sale of the property through a public auction, the hotel won’t be able to
                                        continue operating and its assets will be sold piecemeal.

Time (in years)       3.0               The foreclosure proceeding will take approximately 3 years in Guatemala from the moment
                                        of Mirage’s default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor. It will take 1.5 years until
                                        the approval to initiate foreclosure is handed down by the Court, including the notification
                                        period and the debtor’s counter-claim. After that stage, it will take 1 year for the auction to
                                        take place (including the necessary time to appoint an auctioneer, the scheduling of the
                                        auction and the sale of the real estate). It will take additional 6 months for the judge to
                                        approve the sale and have it registered.

Cost (% of            14.5              The cost for a foreclosure proceeding as described above would amount approximately to
estate)                                 15% of the value of Mirage’s estate. The main component of this expenditure would be the
                                        attorney’s fees, which would amount 8% of the value of Mirage’s estate. The rest would be
                                        the costs of the custodian and property appraisal which would amount to 5% of the value of
                                        Mirage’s estate. The rest of the cost would be judicial and notification expenses. Article 396
                                        of the Procedural Civil and Commercial Code of Guatemala provides that in no case the total
                                        fees of all professionals involved in the insolvency process may not exceed 12% of the value
                                        of the claim. However, this article does not apply to foreclosures. They can be calculated
                                        according to the professional schedules for arbitrators, attorneys, judicial leaders, experts,
                                        auditors and trustees. (Decree 111-96)
