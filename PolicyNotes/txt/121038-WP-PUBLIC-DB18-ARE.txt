About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        - The prescribed application form, signed by the company manager(s) or
        their legal representative(s).
        - The memorandum of association (an original and a copy).
        - A letter issued by the DED, attesting to the company name approval.

       - The application for entry of the company name in the Commercial Register
       (copy).
       - Extract of the entry of the company name in the Commercial Register.


       Publication takes several months. However, this time frame is not important
       because the authorities will accept a copy of the Ministry's receipt of
       publication fee payment. After the publication, the Ministry of Economy
       issues its approval letter.


       Before the newly formed company can begin operations, it must apply to the
       DED for a trade license. After the notary public at the Commercial Registry
       notarizes the memorandum of association, a license application form is
       completed in Arabic, signed by the authorized company signatory and led
       with the DED in duplicate. The DED les one copy and forwards the other to
       the UAE Federal Ministry of Economy.
       The trade license application must be led with the applicable fee and the
       following documents:
       - The prescribed form for setting out the proposed company name in Arabic
       and English.
       - The original lease for the company’s o ce premises.
       - The prescribed form for obtaining the Dubai Municipality Building
       Department’s clearance on the suitability of the o ce premises.


       All business activities fall into three categories of licenses: (1) commercial
       licenses, covering all kinds of trading activity; (2) professional licenses,
       covering professions, services, craftsmen, and artisans; and (3) industrial
       licenses, establishing industrial or manufacturing activity.


       Upon the conclusion of this procedure, the DED issues the original Trade
       License and Commercial Registration certi cates. Upon presentation of the
       receipts showing payment of the Ministry publication fee and the Chamber
       of Commerce membership fee, the DED will issue the original trade license
       and certi cate of commercial registration for the limited liability company
       and the DCCI membership. Alternatively, the online license application is
       available whereby the applicant submits the lled-in form, completes online
       payment and instantly receives the license certi cate which can then be
       printed out.



       Fees are: 5% of the value of the lease agreement + AED 3,000 waste fees +

This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      through the Dubai Municipality portal at the same time as the building
      permit. NOCs are required from the following departments and are valid for
      2 years:
      • Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) on electrical wiring
      installation drawings
      • Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) on water connection

      permit. However, it now takes a bit longer to receive the building permit, as
      the Civil Defense approval can take up to 1 month.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                       Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest        registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population        secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                     In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow

                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                           largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.



What the indicators measure                                  Case study assumptions

courts (calendar days)                                       between 2 domestic businesses. The case study assumes that the court
                                                             hears an expert on the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes

  Time for trial and to obtain the judgment

                                                             several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the              - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                          and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                              economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                             - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                             - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                           equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                   - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                             commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                             - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                      - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                     - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                       - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                             movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                           This part will take up to 8-12 months. Hotel’s assets will be sold at a public auction and at
                                           least two auctions will probably be held before the assets can be sold successfully. It will take
                                           up to 1 year to sell the assets. Some contributors from the Economic Court mentioned that
                                           the time and cost is reduced for 2015 due to the electronic filing but most contributors said
                                           that it changed the system but it does not necessarily change the time to look at cases as we
