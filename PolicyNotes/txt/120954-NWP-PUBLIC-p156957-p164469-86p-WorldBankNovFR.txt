         Part One: The State of the Economy


           Key Messages
              Tanzania’s economic growth has softened, with the rate declining to 6.8 percent in the first
                half of 2017, compared to the figure of 7.7 percent recorded in the same period in 2016.
                However, Tanzania was still amongst the strongest performers in the region. The inflation rate
                has remained low and stable. The slight decline in exports in the first half of 2017 was more
                than offset by the decline in imports, leading to a narrowing of the current account deficit. By
                mid-2017, foreign exchange reserves increased to more than five months of import cover, while
                the value of the shilling remained stable.

              Fiscal and monetary policy challenges remain. Persistently high domestic payment arrears (at
                around 6 percent of GDP at the end of 2016/17) and the low execution rate of the development
                budget (62 percent in 2016/17) threaten the credibility of the budget. A looser monetary policy
                has yet to translate into a reduced cost of borrowing for the private sector or into increased
                private investment, partly because of the continued uncertainty. The financial sector remains
                stable, though the Government’s arrears have contributed to the high ratio of non-performing
                loans (about 11 percent at the end of June 2017).

              Over the short to medium term, the growth outlook is favorable, with key risks being both
                mostly domestic and under the Government’s control. The growth rate is projected to reach
                6.6 percent in 2017, slightly below the Government forecast of 6.9 percent, mainly due to
                the under execution of the development budget and the weak business environment. In the
                medium term, the main risks relate to a further deterioration in business sentiment as a result
                of increased policy uncertainty and to a decline in the execution rate of the development
                budget. The most significant external risks relate to a potential rebound in oil prices, volatile
                global financial conditions, and a decline in demand from Tanzania’s main export partners.

              Near-term policy priorities should focus on improving the implementation of the budget and
                the business environment. Clearing verified payment arrears to private sector contractors and
                suppliers; speeding up delinquent VAT refunds; and securing external financing to increase the
                execution of planned capital expenditures are required to boost the economy in the near term.
                Over the medium term, the Government should implement structural reforms to increase
                private investment, including reforms to reduce the costs to business of regulatory compliance
                and to improve infrastructure services and skills. These reforms are vital to achieve higher
                economic growth and to create a greater number of productive jobs.

                                Box 1: Performance of Tanzania’s Manufactured Exports

The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has reported a large decrease in Tanzania’s manufactured exports in 2017, noting that some
of the decrease is due to classification changes from the adoption of the EAC’s Single Customs Territory. International
data also suggests the decline coincides with softening of demand. Global manufacturing imports declined by more than
6 percent in both 2015 and 2016.  In the sub-Saharan African region, to which Tanzania exports around 74 percent of its
manufactures, manufacturing imports fell by more than a quarter in both years (see Figure 2).  Imports of Tanzania’s four
largest export manufactures (yarns, textiles, dyes and lime cement) collectively fell by 15 percent globally and by 46.8
percent in sub-Saharan Africa.  

Demand for Tanzania’s manufactured exports could improve as growth in sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to increase to
2.6 percent in 2017 and to 3.2 percent in 2018, as the terms of trade shock in commodity-exporters wanes.* However,
Tanzania could still take steps to improve the performance of its manufacturing exports. The trade sector is particularly
investment-intensive, meaning that improvements to the business climate that result in increased investment could
have a disproportionate impact on traded manufactures, and help to increase the diversity and complexity of Tanzania’s
exports. In this area, Tanzania showed a strong performance until 2013, when the complexity of its exports increased,
though data for the last three years suggests a decline (see Figure 3).

Finally, Nurturing regional trade will also support Tanzania’s goal of industrialization by increasing the manufactured
content of its exports.   Intra-African trade tends to be more industrial, with fewer regulations and smaller existing
production bases.** Furthermore, 80 percent of Tanzania’s manufactured exports within sub-Saharan Africa go to the
eight countries with which it shares a border. This points to the need to continue to invest in trade infrastructure and to
improve Tanzania’s connectivity.

                     Part Two: Managing Water Wisely: The
                     Urgent Need to Improve Water Resources
                     Management in Tanzania


                        Key Messages

                        Tanzania is already water stressed, which negatively impacts the economy, society
                        and the environment.
                           Over the last 25 years the Tanzanian population has doubled, the size of the economy
                             has more than tripled, but the amount of water has remained the same. Water is
                             a finite resource (unlike electricity, roads, food, housing, healthcare and most other
                             inputs to the economy), so as need and demand for water doubles or triples, the
                             result is growing water stress. The consequence is that Tanzania’s water resources
                             recently dropped below 1,700 cubic meters per capita, meaning that Tanzania has
                             joined the ranks of the world’s water stressed countries.

                           While this ‘average’ level of water stress is significant, real-world water stress is
                             significantly higher during dry seasons and in drier parts of the country. Most
                             rain falls in 2-3 months of the year, and after accounting for environmental flow
                             requirements, national demand in Tanzania is already 150 percent of accessible
                             water during dry periods. Since water and development is also unevenly distributed
                             across Tanzania’s nine river basins, water stress also differs geographically.

                           In addition to water stress brought about by too little water, floods – or too much
                             water – can also have severe economic impacts, as can degrading water quality, the
                             changing distribution of water across seasons and locations, and the effectiveness
                             of water supply and sanitation services.

                        Water resources management requires trade-offs and prioritization, which will
                        require tough decisions and action at all levels of government.
                           Water is, most importantly, a social good: people drink it every day, wash with
                             it, and cook food with it. Access to sufficient water to meet basic needs is, quite
                             literally, a matter of life and death. As an environmental good, water keeps alive the
                             ecosystems on which the environment, people and the economy depend. And as an
                             economic good, water is a critical factor of production and productivity. Given that
                             water is a finite resource, the challenge is to purposefully and carefully manage the
                             trade-offs between the social, environmental, and economic uses of water.

      Tanzania is making progress in increasing access to water supply, where 63 percent
        of the population has access to basic and improved water supply services.18
        Sanitation services, on the other hand, have a long way to go where only 27 percent
        of the population has access to basic and improved facilities. Improving access to
        sustainable services is vitally important to poverty reduction but also, through
        influencing public health and human productivity, the economy more broadly.
        Ensuring the sustainability of water sources for urban and rural water supply is
        critical, and while cities can be large water users at the local scale, the absolute
        quantities of water required for domestic use are relatively small (roughly 10 percent
        of water needs globally).

      At present, around 89 percent of Tanzania’s water is used for agriculture (compared
        to a global average of 70 percent), around 10 percent for domestic consumption (like
        global averages), and about 1 percent for industry (very low by global standards).
        A key water resource management challenge for Tanzania is reducing the large
        quantity of water consumed by agriculture to ensure that water is available to
        meet development goals on industrialization, energy production and water supply.

  Implementation of the water resources policy and legal framework is a cross-
  cutting issue that must be taken seriously, capacitated and resourced.
      Tanzania’s water resource policies, legal framework and institutional arrangements
        are broadly appropriate. Water Boards, representing some of the key stakeholders,
        are in place for each river basin, and most have developed medium-term water
        resource development and management plans. However, the number of staff and
        level of resources will need to be scaled up to be proportionate with the scale of the
        challenge. Similarly, strong political leadership will be needed to reconcile the range
        of formal and informal activities across all sectors with a sustainable level of water
        resource use.

      Pricing water is a key implementation challenge and is important in three ways:
        to help make water services more sustainable; to create disincentives for wasting
        water; and to help allocate water towards more economically productive activities.
        While pricing water needs to be carefully managed to meet social, environmental
        and economic objectives, there is considerable scope for progress on pricing in
        Tanzania: water services are a long way from cost-recovery and bulk water costs
        are so low that running a tap for an entire year would cost around US$2.60.19

      Improving enforcement of current plans and regulations is the other key
        implementation challenge. This requires investing in improved monitoring systems,
        supporting the growth of water user groups, increasing resources for field-work,
        and strong political support for enforcement activities.

     Box 2: Drought Impacts the Economy
     Droughts are already a frequent occurrence in Tanzania, and their force is often severe. Tanzania
     has suffered numerous significant droughts over the past 20 years (eight years out of twenty in
     the Pangani Basin alone), with a resulting loss of productivity in the food, energy, and industrial
     sectors that threatens future growth (see Figure 21).

     In sub-Saharan African countries, growth in the agricultural sector is reduced by an average of
     3.5 percent as a result of each drought.27 In Tanzania, the agricultural sector suffers an estimated
     US$ 200 million in average annual losses because of weather-related occurrences, largely due
     to drought.28 As recently as April 2017, a drought led to food shortages and to an increase in
     aggregate food prices of 12.0 percent, with repercussions throughout the region.29 In another
     example, a significant drought in 2009 resulted in the mortality of 80 percent of livestock in
     northern Tanzania, undermining the achievement of local and national food security and longer-
     term development.30

     Hydroelectric energy production also declines as a result of droughts. In 2009-2011, upstream
     withdrawals for agriculture and a prolonged drought reduced surface water flows and reservoir
     levels in the Rufiji and Pangani rivers, the main sources of hydropower production in Tanzania. The
     reduced flows significantly decreased hydropower production.31 TANESCO, the national power
     utility, had to employ a costly emergency power generation program that involved imported
     diesel and the production of power at a substantial variable cost, whereas the variable cost for
     hydropower is quite low.32 The emergency power generation program employed to address the
     2010/2011 drought resulted in huge additional costs for Tanzania.

higher-value crops and to waste less water. More than 80 percent of irrigated land in Tanzania is farmed using traditional irrigation
practices with rates of water use efficiency as low as 15 percent. This compares very unfavorably to other countries that have
applied modern water use systems, and recorded rates in excess of 90 percent as a result of proper distribution, conveyance and
field application systems being in place.41

Crop-yield is also particularly low in unregulated irrigation systems in Tanzania, where a combination of poor structural design and
the overuse of water due to inadequate pricing can result in water logging, reduce crop-yield, increase prevalence of aquatic weeds
and diseased crops, and restrict crop type to paddy rice rather than cash crops or more nutrient-dense crops. Without an incentive
to save water, farmers are not motivated to modernize farming practices to reduce water loss and to improve the productivity
of their farms. When water is given an explicit value, and is regarded as a quantifiable input for agriculture, there is an incentive
to use only the water that is needed. Farming and irrigation practices improve, and cropping patterns better reflect the reality
of the environmental constraints. The result is higher crop yields, a shift towards higher value crops, and less wasted water. By
better valuing their water, several neighboring countries have outperformed Tanzania in attaining higher country-wide aggregate
irrigation efficiencies, demonstrating that Tanzania is capable of improvement (see Table 1).

There is also a major water management gap in the area of allocations, monitoring and enforcement for small-holder farmers. In
some areas, informal irrigated systems are larger than formal systems and expand when wet-season rains are more plentiful. This
expansion of irrigation has dramatically increased the water requirements in several basins, to the point that water requirements
now exceed water availability. For example, in the Great Ruaha River sub-basin, extensive informal irrigation (see Figure 22) is one
of the major reasons that the perennial river now runs dry for between two and four months every year, creating hardships for
down-stream uses, including subsistence agriculture, livestock, the Ruaha National Park, and hydropower production in the Mtera/
Kidatu System.42  The large proportion of unregulated water users makes it challenging for government to track, monitor and plan
water allocations.

     Box 4: Water Quality Challenges are Growing
     The troubling water scarcity issues in Tanzania are compounded by water pollution, which is
     steadily impacting water quality across the country, with the concentrations of sediment, salinity,
     fecal matter and chemicals increasing in rivers and aquifers. When water quality is degraded, it has
     significant negative impacts on human health, damages ecosystems and reduces the life-span and
     effectiveness of investments in irrigation and hydropower infrastructure.
     For example, in Dar es Salaam, less than half of the inhabitants have access to the main water
     network and instead use private and unlicensed boreholes. Overuse of the shallow aquifers under
     the city has led to drinking water contamination from sea water. Residents of Dar es Salaam also
     face health risks resulting from the poor disposal of industrial effluents and unimproved sanitation.51
     Unfortunately, most of the evidence on declining water quality is anecdotal. There are huge
     knowledge gaps regarding water quality in Tanzania because there is not a sufficient monitoring
     network and there is limited industrial regulation. Improved information on water quality will help
     the Government make informed decisions about water resources to keep the Tanzanian people
     healthy and the economy running.

Box 5: Saving the Great Ruaha Requires Improved Water Management

In many ways, the water resources situation in the Great Ruaha exemplifies many of the
management challenges that are occurring throughout Tanzania.  In this sub-basin of the
Rufiji Basin, irrigated agriculture is situated upstream of the Ruaha National Park, which
is in turn upstream of the Mtera-Kidatu hydropower cascade.  These upstream regulated
and unregulated irrigation schemes withdraw significant quantities of water – in fact,
they withdraw so much water, that this perennial river no longer flows for more than
100 days during the annual dry season.  The lack of water creates extreme stress for the
wildlife in the park as it reduces food and shelter for many animals.  Reducing the river
to puddles in the dry season also increases the wildlife disease burden as animals are far
more crowded than they are used to and increases human-wildlife conflict as the animals
are forced to forage further and further from the river bed.  The uncontrolled upstream
water withdrawals also impact the hydroelectric power production in the basin, where
hydropower plants are operated sub-optimally because of a lack of available water.  The
situation is broadly known in Tanzania and the government is taking serious steps toward
addressing the overarching water management challenges.

The four factors needed for making water work will also make water work in The Great
Ruaha.

Rufiji Basin Requires Enhanced Multi-Sectoral Coordination, Investment Prioritization
and Information for Decision-making. Information on water usage and sectoral plans
must be synthesized and shared with decision makers at all levels.   Taking a hard look
at future investment choices and coordination among all effected sectors is essential to
reversing the damage in the Ruaha, as well as planning resources in the remainder of the
Rufiji basin.  

Strongly Enforced Water Pricing Reflective of Scarcity and Drought in the Rufiji Basin.
Valuing water for all uses, including environmental needs, is currently lacking in the
Ruaha. The current system of “first-access” by upstream irrigators reduces the regional or
national ability to allocate water to its highest socio-economic use.  Enforcement of water
permitting is also a gap that must be addressed, both to reverse damage in the Ruaha and
to avoid similar situations across the country. Efficiency improvement in the use of water
for agriculture is a priority, together with investments in drainage infrastructure to ensure
water used for irrigation can return to the environment. Imposing a freeze in the use of
any new agricultural land for irrigation until efficiency is increased and pricing methods are
implemented is recommended.

Clarity, Capacity and Resources to Carry out Institutional Mandates.  The insufficient
capacity in the Ministry of Water and Rufiji Basn Water Board hampers their ability to
address the issues in the Ruaha basin.   Enhanced de facto authority and capacity to
increase coordination and awareness raising at the regional and district levels – both
within the Ruaha sub-basin and in other sub-basins – are much needed to reduce over-
extraction in the Great Ruaha River.

Box 6: WRM Institutions Demonstrating Multi-Sectoral Coordination: Mexico and
Brazil

Improved water resources management for sustainable development requires a well-
established national institution with executive function that leads strong coordination,
involves stakeholder participation and supports multi-level governance. Experiences
from other countries can inspire how water resources management in Tanzania could be
improved.

Mexico - The National Water Commission, CONAGUA, is a federal institution created in
1989. The mandate of CONAGUA is to manage and preserve national waters to achieve
sustainable use, with joint responsibility of the three tiers of government (federal, state, and
municipal), thus requiring co-ordination initiatives. This is the highest institution in Mexico
for water resource management, encompassing water policy, water rights and planning,
and many other water related services. Its Technical Council is an inter-ministerial body in
charge of evaluating and approving CONAGUA’s programs, projects, budget and operations,
as well as coordinating water policies across departments and public administration
agencies. The council is composed of the highest representatives from eight ministries
and national institutes. Mexico’s water sector has undergone more than three decades of
serious and far reaching reforms. Over the years, capacity has been built within CONAGUA
to enable it to undertake information-based planning and decision-making.

Brazil – The National Water Agency, ANA, is a federal agency under the Ministry of the
Environment, as part of the national water resource management system. With administrative
and financial autonomy, ANA is responsible for implementing the national water resources
policies, granting and providing funds, regulating access to water, promoting its sustainable
use and arbitrating conflicts among users. ANA acts as an executive-regulatory agency to
manage water with three mechanisms: the granting of rights to the use of water resources,
the commitment to inspections that ensure licenses are effectively respected, and the
charging for water use. It plays management and coordination roles. Water sector reforms
in Brazil started about two decades ago, leading to the establishment of ANA in 2000. The
reform process fostered the development of water information, knowledge, and capacity
that enables ANA to carry out strategic planning and sound decision making for water
resources management. Being the authority to implement and co-ordinate the National
Water Law, ANA Brazil has brought a general improvement of water resource management
in Brazil.

Annex 16: Business sentiment survey

   The views of business managers of the top 100 mid-sized companies in Tanzania have been collected every six months since
   April 2013. However, in December 2016, it was collected after 12 months. This data is collected by KPMG through electronic
   questionnaires, with anonymous responses. In June 2017, about half of responding managers assessed the performance of the
   economy to be worse than in the previous year, while less than one third reported that it had remained the same. Looking forward,
   40 percent of the managers were pessimistic about the economy and 36 percent about their own businesses, which is significantly
   lower compared to the position expressed in December in 2016. Only about 30 percent of the responding managers are optimistic
   about the economy and their business.

   How do you believe the Tanzanian economy is performing compared to last year?
