About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                  The certi cate of availability of the company name is typically requested
                  through the website of the Central Commercial Registry. If the certi cate is
                  not requested online, the nal document can be obtained by (i) certi ed
                  mail, (ii) through a notary with the notarial platform SIGNO; (iii) visiting the
                  Central Commercial Registry; or (iv) courier. In all cases, the certi cate is
                  issued by the following day.


                  Once the Registry issues the certi cate, the requested corporate name will
                  be reserved for a maximum of 6 months from the certi cate's date of
                  issuance. Each certi cate is valid for 3 months from its date of issuance.
                  Furthermore, once the certi cate's validity has expired (3 months), the
                  certi cate can only be renewed once, after which a new certi cate must be

        Agency : Help Desk for Entrepreneurs (PAE)

        Limited liability companies can be incorporated through CIRCE, the
        electronic platform of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism. Through
        CIRCE, the entrepreneur completes a single registration form called DUE that
        is then sent to the notary's o ce, the commercial registry, the tax agency
        and the social security agency (for registration of the company and of its
        employees, if it has them).


        The single registration form can be led at any Help Desk for Entrepreneurs
        (Puntos de Atención al Emprendedor - PAE) or online by the entrepreneur, in
        which case a digital signature is required. Once the DUE is sent, an
        appointment request is generated by the SIGNO system with the notary
        chosen for the preparation of the public deed of incorporation.

       Agency : Public Notary

       Within a week approximately, the public deed is granted by the notary, and
       the company is registered with the commercial registry and the tax
       authorities. Besides the granting of the deed that requires the physical
       presence of the founders, the rest of the procedures are completed
       electronically through CIRCE or SIGNO. Additionally, the CIRCE platform
       o ers other services such as registration of personal data with the Spanish
       Data Protection Agency and request of the trade name of the company with
       the Spanish Patent and Trademark O ce.

       Alternatively, on SIGNO (the online platform for notaries), the notary can
       complete other procedures such as obtaining the scal identi cation
       number, the registered public deed, and the nal company name.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : Municipality of Madrid

      The certi cate of alignment is issued by the Municipality of Madrid which
      provides the exact limit of the private property with respect to public roads.

      The cost is established by "Ordenanza scales y precios públicos Tasa por
      Prestación de Servicios Urbanísticos" under article 9. The o cial cost is
      €62.15 per 10 linear meters in the front of the building. In the Doing Business
      case study, the front of the building is assumed to be 30 meters, so the total
      cost would be €186.45.

  3   Obtain results of topographical study                                                 7 days                  EUR 800
      Agency : Private licensed company

      A topographical study is conducted prior to construction to measure the
      levels on the speci c terrain. It is a general technical requirement when
      building a structure of this class. This procedure is required by Codigo
      Tecnico de Edi cacion (March 2006) as part of the Basic Project to be
      presented.

  4   Request and obtain a certi cate of compliance (certi cado de                          60 days                 EUR 5,902
      conformidad)
      Agency : Entidades Colaboradoras Urbanisticas - ECU

      Upon reception of alignment certi cate, BuildCo must obtain a compliance
      certi cate. This certi cate is the provisional license which can be obtained
      from two agencies - Municipality or Entidades Colaboradoras Urbanisticas -
      ECU. According to the new Local Ordinance of the City Council of Madrid
      ("Ordenanza para la apertura de actividades economicas en la ciudad de
      Madrid").

      The ECU has 2 months to examine the documentation and grant the
      compliance certi cate. Once the compliance certi cate has been granted, it
      must be attached to the building permit application.

      The nal construction permit is issued by the Municipality. Once the building
      license is issued by the Municipality of Madrid, BuildCo can proceed with the
      construction. For that reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with
      the previous one.

       Architects of Madrid
       Agency : College of Architects of Madrid

       The College of Architects of Madrid must approves BuildCo’s draft project
       proposal and implementation plan. In particular, the College of Architects of
       Madrid veri es the professional quali cations of the individual in charge of
       the construction work and validates the correctness and completeness of
       the documentation provided for the project with respect to regulations.


       The following documentation must be provided:

       -report on the project
       -implementation plan
       -administrative and technical conditions’ statement
       -measurements
       -budget
       -health and safety study


       The procedure is legislated in "Real Decreto 1000/2010, de 5 de agosto,
       sobre visado colegial obligatorio".

       The basis of the cost is in "Precios del Visado de los Trabajos profesionales".
       The formula used is the following: Cost of approval = Módulo x C x S x Qv x F /
       6000. For a warehouse such as the Doing Business case study: M = 497.43; C
       = 9.00; S = 1300.6; Qv = 1.40; F = 0.85. Therefore, cost of approval is 497.43
       *9*1300.6*1,40*0.85/6000 = 1,154.82 EUR

       According to the building license, one on-site inspection must be carried out
       during construction and one at the end of the process.


       If, during the inspections, the committee detects any possible infringements
       of the building regulations or criminal law, a proposal on sanctions must be
       made, and a copy of the written record is given to the public prosecutor. At
       minimum, administrative proceedings are initiated.


       In each inspection report, a record is included that provides information on
       every person involved and their roles, as well as on the facts, circumstances,
       dates, and results of the inspection. The record is regarded as a public
       administrative deed. The record must be signed by the inspector(s) and by
       the person to whom the construction works have been attributed at the
       time of the inspection. The inspection can only be conducted once the
       construction has started, for that reason this procedure cannot be
       simultaneous with the previous one.

       Once construction works have been completed, the architect and surveyor
       must sign o a document certifying that the construction has followed the
       approved plans. Therefore, both individuals are responsible for the
       construction performed. This completion certi cate must be approved by
       the College of Architects of Madrid.


       This procedure is legislated in "Real Decreto 1000/2010, de 5 de agosto,

       This procedure can only be done when the consturciton is nalized, for that
       reason this procedure cannot be simultaneous with the previous one.



       The basis of the cost is in "Precios del Visado de los Trabajos profesionales".
       The formula used is the following: Cost of approval = Módulo x C x S x Qv x F /
       6000. For a warehouse such as the Doing Business case study: M = 497.43; C
       = 9.00; S = 1300.6; Qv = 1.40; F = 0.15. Therefore, cost of approval is 497.43

       following documents to the ECU:
       • Final certi cate of terminated construction (declaration of conformity),
       which must be signed by the technical director of the work. This certi cate
       must declare that the constructed building is in accordance with the issued
       license. For modi cations that do not need approval of the City Council (23.2
       of the Ordenanza Municipal de Tramitación de Licencias Urbanísticas de 23
       de diciembre de 2004), the builder has to detail these modi cations.

       activities have been executed according to the project and the conditions
       under which the license had been granted, and that the construction has
       been completed and is adequate for urban determinations, the atmosphere

      Agency : Iberdrola

      Customers must submit an application for a new connection with the utility.
      Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica will prepare an estimate and inform the
      customer with a letter about the estimated costs of the project and the
      technical characteristics of the project. The payment is made at the bank. A

      Agency : City Council

      Customers need to obtain a license for the external works from the
      municipality. The tax for this license is charged as 4% of the cost of the
      works, plus a fee for provision of urban services (‘Tasa por prestación de
      servicios urbanísticos’), and a fee for private use of public spaces (‘Tasa por
      Utilización Privativa o Aprovechamiento Especial del Dominio Público Local’).

      Agency : Iberdrola

      Customers have two choices: The external connection works can be done by
      Iberdrola or the customer can hire a private licensed electrical constructor.

      In most cases, for a connection with a capacity of 140 kVA, customers hire a
      private company to carry out the works. For such a capacity, the connection
      is considered in most cases as low voltage. This cost includes materials and
      labor.

      Agency : General Directorate for Industry, Energy and Mining (‘DGIEM’)

      The customer obtains a clearance of the electrical installation (‘acta de
      puesta en servicio’) from the General Directorate for Industry, Energy and
      Mining to certify that it is in compliance with its requirements. The
      documents to be presented are:

      - Contract of maintenance of proof of own capacity of maintenance of
      transformers

      Irrespective of who executes the actual works of the connection (installation
      of the transformer, excavation for cables etc.), Iberdrola is always in charge
      of installing the meter and the nal energization of the project. The meter
      can be rented or bought by the customer. Most clients prefer to rent it at an
      approximate cost of EUR 12 per month. According to Article 79 of the Real
      Decreto 1955/2000, the utility can levy a security deposit in the amount of                                               Page 26

      information as an Ownership and encumbrances Certi cate, and bearing the
      same responsibility of the Registrar in case of mistake as a formal certi cate
      would provide. This is an information product speci cally foreseen by the
      Mortgage Law to answer the Notary's requests of Information related to
      registrable acts and contracts. The Notary submits an electronic request and
      receives the information also by electronic means. From that moment and
      for the next ten days, the Registrar must inform the Notary about any
      Document submitted to the Land Registry related to the same property,
      within the maximum term of 24 hours since such document was submitted
      to the Land Registry O ce. This procedure is aimed at preventing any
      surprises or unexpected situations while the contract is being formalized.

      The Notary would search the land parcel corresponding to the property
      object of the transaction to identify the area of the land whether there are
      any buildings in the property and the cadastral value for tax purposes (for
      property transfer tax/value added tax, for municipal capital gains tax and for
      real estate tax).

      The Notary has special access to the Cadaster database. If parties check this
      information by themselves, they still can verify boundaries, size and
      buildings, but they cannot obtain information on ownership and cadastral
      value. In order to obtain this information, they have to request an extract for
      a fee.

   4   Payment of the Transfer Tax (ITP) and obtain the con rmation of                    1 day    6% of purchase price
       payment at tax authority                                                                    (ITP)

       First transfers of property or transfers made between entrepreneurs are
       subject to VAT and Stamp Duty. Second and subsequent property transfers
       are not subject to VAT, but to the Transfer Tax ("Impuesto sobre
       Transmisiones Patrimoniales y Actos Jurídicos Documentados", ITP).


       For the Doing Business case study, as it is assumed that the buyer is a
       company and the property is in Madrid and has been transferred at least
       once in the past, the applicable tax should be the Transfer Tax (ITP). The ITP
       is paid at the relevant tax o ce within 30 working days after the date of
       granting of the notarial deed of transfer (a copy of the transfer deed is to be
       attached to the transfer tax liquidation form).


       In some autonomias, like Madrid, Catalunya, and Andalucia, the tax may be
       paid online, although the buyer needs to obtain a stamp from the tax
       authority con rming the payment for ITP and capital gains tax.


       However, it has to be noted that under certain circumstances (e.g., that the
       acquisition of the property is within the scope of the usual activities of the
       acquiring company), the acquiring company can choose to make the
       transaction subject to transfer tax or VAT. The VAT paid would become a
       credit that the company would deduct from subsequent transactions, such
       as those related to the normal business of the company.

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator          Answer            Explanation

Proceeding         reorganization    Mirage will file for insolvency proceedings (declaración de concurso) and would seek to reach
                                     a reorganization agreement with its creditors. One of the main advantages of this option is
                                     that once the “concurso” commences, all enforcement actions against the debtor would be
                                     automatically suspended for at least a year. The Insolvency Act provides a unitary form of
                                     insolvency proceedings (procedimiento concursal) which has a common phase and two
                                     possible outcomes: (i) reorganization (convenio de acreedores) or (ii) liquidation. The law will
                                     also set forth all assumptions on which the reorganization proceeding could be converted
                                     into liquidation.

Outcome            going concern     The hotel will continue operating as a going concern given the financial well-being and
                                     viability of the company. While most insolvency proceedings (concursos) in Spain ended up
                                     in liquidations, in the case at stake a liquidation proceeding would not make much sense
                                     since the market value of the operating business is much greater than the value of its assets
                                     sold separately. Therefore, the possibilities to fetch market value in a reorganization
                                     proceeding are greater than in a liquidation proceeding.

Time (in years)    1.5               An abbreviated insolvency proceeding before the commercial Court of Madrid will last 1.5
                                     years (art. 190 LC). Once the insolvency proceeding commences, the appointment of the
                                     insolvency administration and the publication of the procedure will last about 1 month. After
                                     that, the preparation of creditors’ claims and the report of insolvency administration will
                                     happen in a period of 6 months (the creditors have a month to submit their claims and the
                                     insolvency administration must review the documentation and accept or reject the claims).
                                     This estimate includes the time spent by the insolvency administration in resolving all
                                     challenges. Following publication of the report by the insolvency administration, it will take
                                     approximately 3-6 months for the debtor to prepare and negotiate the reorganization
                                     agreement with the creditors, which will be voted a month after it is admitted by the
                                     Commercial Court. Assuming that the agreement is approved by the creditors' meeting, the
                                     court would ratify the agreement and the secured creditor would start receiving payments.

Cost (% of         11.0              The costs associated with the reorganization proceeding would amount to approximately
estate)                              11% of the value of the estate according to our estimate. The main component of this
                                     expenditure would be the attorney’s fees (4 - 7%), Insolvency representative fees (3.5%),
                                     Trustee (0.5%) cost of service and publication in the Official Gazette (0.2%).
