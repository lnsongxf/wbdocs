About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       are about ILS 20 for application and ILS 100 for the license. The municipality
       previously sent notices to the health and the relevant security authorities,
       such as the civil defense, to proceed with their inspections of the company
       premises. Since January 2014, a civil defense employee from the Fire
       Department and a doctor from the Ministry of Health were appointed at the
       municipality in order to carry out the necessary inspections and grant
       approvals for the business license as soon as the entrepreneur applies.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

       Agency : Engineers Association

       The contractor (usually the engineer who designed the structural plans) will
       provide the following documents to the Engineers Association for
       veri cation and approval:


       - Lab reports
       - Name of site engineer
       - Supervision contract
       - Plans of excavation


       Once the engineers have veri ed that all documentations are accurate, the
       chief engineer will sign on the document granting permission to proceed
       with the excavation (for such a warehouse, the excavation will probably be
       about 3 meters and the foundation will be around 80 cm).

  11   Notify the Municipality of Commencement of construction                           1 day     no charge
       Agency : Municipality of Ramallah

       The contractor will inform the Municipality of the start of construction so
       that the Municipality can verify the foundation once it has started.

       During construction the municipality randomly inspects the excavation work
       to ensure it complies with the building laws and regulations. The Syndicate
       Engineer however is the one responsible for inspecting the construction
       work as it relates to the engineering. Any building over 600 sq. m. must have
       a supervising engineer on site at all times.

       concrete casting permit to the Municipality. Therefore, BuildCo would no
       longer need to visit the Municipality in person to submit this permit.

      Agency : Jerusalem District Electric Company (JDECO)

      The following documents are needed along with the application (that can be
      submitted in person only):
      • Building permit and excavation permit;
      • Copy of ID card;
      • Copy of sell-purchase agreement;
      • Number of client’s closest service or of their old service;
      • Site plan for the land;
      • Requested capacity in kVA;
      • Business license of the company;
      • Expected loads in the rst phase and future developments; and
      • Nature and type of the building and construction stages

      After the application has been submitted, a number is given so clients can
      follow up on the status of their application online.

      Once JDECO has prepared and approved the invoice, the costs are
      communicated to the customer. The customer has one-month to pay dues,
      otherwise, a new quote and invoice must be requested.

      Agency : Jerusalem District Electric Company (JDECO)

      JDECO will conduct an external inspection to prepare an estimate for the
      connection fees. A contract is signed between the two parties once the client
      has paid the estimated cost for the external works.

      The contractor usually hires an electrician registered with Jerusalem
      Electricity Distribution Company (JDECO) to prepare an electrical scheme for
      and complete the internal wiring of the warehouse.

      Agency : Jerusalem District Electric Company (JDECO)

      The utility will apply for an excavation permit at the municipality on behalf of
      the customer. The electricity company also needs to obtain clearances from
      other utilities and agencies such as water, drainage, telephone, and roads
      departments.

      For the case study warehouse, a substation is most likely needed. The utility
      might need to wait some time to obtain the clearances and acquire any

       The utility will apply for an excavation permit at the municipality on behalf of
       the customer. The electricity company also needs to obtain clearances from
       other utilities and agencies such as water, drainage, telephone, and roads
       departments.

       For the case study warehouse, a substation is most likely needed. The utility
       might need to wait some time to obtain the clearances and acquire any
       material it might not have in stock for an expansion of the network (such as
       switchgears).

       The client is responsible for the internal wiring including circuits and panel
       board and the company is responsible for the external wiring (including
       excavation works and layout of cables from the substation to the medium
       voltage network).

       When the external works have been completed, and after the electrician has
        nished the internal installation, the electrician (licensed by the utility) needs
       to submit to the electricity company their electrical plans attesting to the
       required speci cations, and request an inspection of the wiring. In order to
       obtain a license from the utility the electrician needs to have earned a
       diploma and had a certain number of years of work experience.


       An inspection to assess the internal wiring (including checking of air levels,
       usage of waterproof material, etc.) is conducted right before electricity is
       turned on.

       Testing is conducted by a di erent department than the one in charge of the
       external works in the electrician’s presence. The electricity is turned upon
       successful inspection.

      The tax clearance from the Ministry of Finance must be obtained. The
      obtained certi cate shows that all taxes, including income taxes and VAT
      have been paid. The applicant must ll out a form and give it to the agent
      who checks on his computer for any overdue taxes. Parties can bring the
      form initially obtained from the land registry in Procedure 1. Lawyers
      generally have copies of the form at their o ces.

      Agency : Municipality

      The clearance obtained from the Ministry of Finance is needed in order to
      obtain the clearance from the Municipality.
      Several departments will be involved in this clearance. The Municipality visits
      the site, and requests the architect's and mayor's signatures.

      valuation
      Agency : Land Authority

      The land registry examines the documents and the property le and
      evaluates the property to determine the taxes to be paid.
      Documents required:
      - incorporation documents
      - board resolutions to buy/sell
      - identi cation of all parties
      - notarized POAs
      - tax clearance from municipality (obtained in procedure 2)
      The valuation is only needed if the property has not been assessed in the
      past 5 years–which indeed applies to this case. If it has, the value should be
      in the title le or the parties give an estimate. If not, then a valuation is
      required. The o cial valuation is done by a committee that uses a GIS-based
      system to assess the property's value. The registry will then take the
      remaining time to make its estimate of the value based on the higher of
      either the parties estimate or the o cial valuation.

                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of enforcing contracts is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
enforcing contracts. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the component indicators.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
