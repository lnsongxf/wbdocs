About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Agency : Tax O ce

        A limited liability company must register with the Myanmar tax authorities.
        Currently, there are no clear guidelines on the registration process; the
        current practice is for companies to submit necessary information and
        documents to the tax o ce. The tax o ce will assign a Matter Coding to
        each taxpayer, although this is not considered a TIN. TIN will only be issued if
        the company is registered under the Large Taxpayers O ce. Newly
        established companies are initially registered under the Medium Taxpayers
        O ce.

        goods). Furthermore, within 10 days of starting a business the tax
        authorities should also be informed.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      The application for a new electricity connection begins with the contractor
      paying a visit to the relevant township where the warehouse is located. At
      this stage, the desired load and type of equipment (air conditioning,
      machines) that will operate in the warehouse must be speci ed. The

      o Ward administrator reference letter (obtained during construction permit)
      o Electrical design
      o Capacity load expected


      After the inspection of the client's warehouse by the township, the
      application is internally distributed among the levels of government, from
      the township to the district, without the intervention of the applicant. There
      are 4 districts in Yangon, divided into 33 townships. The application is then
      internally distributed from the district to the city level (Yangon Electricity
      Supply Board), without the interaction of the applicant.

      Once the application has received the approval of all levels – township and
      district – the contractor is informed and he/she can go back to the township
      o ce to pick up the invoice which will indicate the fees that need to be paid
      to the state in relation to the connection to the electrical grid. The payment
      of the administrative fees provided by the township is made at a designated
      state-owned bank.

      The township technician will inspect to see how far the warehouse is from
      the main transmission line, the posts, etc. A map of the necessary
      connection works is made.

      Agency : Private contractor

      A licensed electrician hired by the client carries out the connection works. A
      transformer is required for any connections above 30 kVa and the client
      buys it. The time of the procedure depends on whether the transformer is
      imported from Japan or China, which clients prefer to do in the majority of
      cases.

      Agency : Township Yangon Electricity Supply Board O ce (YESB)

      Upon the completion of the connection works, the customer goes to YESB
      Township O ce to ll up the application form for the meter box installation,
      together with information on the size of transformer (160 kVA for our case
      study). The YESB Township O ce will approve it and submit it to the YESB
      District O ce, which in turn approves it and submits it to the YESB Head
      O ce Testing and Supporting Unit. The Testing and Supporting Unit                                                          Page 22

      Upon the completion of the connection works, the customer goes to YESB
      Township O ce to ll up the application form for the meter box installation,
      together with information on the size of transformer (160 kVA for our case
      study). The YESB Township O ce will approve it and submit it to the YESB
      District O ce, which in turn approves it and submits it to the YESB Head
      O ce Testing and Supporting Unit. The Testing and Supporting Unit
      approves it, obtains a required meter box from YESB warehouse, and checks
      the functioning of the meter box. Then, the YESB Head O ce sends the
      application, together with the meter box, back to the YESB District O ce for
      approval on the meter box, after which back to the YESB Township O ce for
      approval of the meter box. While the process should be internal with various
      level of YESB o ces, in practice the customer often follows up to expedite -
      i.e. the customer will take the form from YESB Township O ce to District
      O ce and again to Head O ce Testing and Supporting Unit to get the
      necessary approvals

  5   Receive inspection of connection works and internal wiring by Ministry         7 calendar days    MMK 0
      of Industry
      Agency : Ministry of Industry

      An engineer from the inspection o ce of the Ministry of Industry is informed
      by the township and conducts an inspection of the connection works and
      internal wiring, mostly to check compliance with safety standards.

      Agency : Township Yangon Electricity Supply Board O ce (YESB)

      Once the meter box is attached, the customer writes an application letter to
      the YESB Township O ce to inform them that the transformer is installed
      and attached to the meter box, together with a list of material used with
      details (e.g. size of 160 kVA, manufacturer of transformer) and photos (two-
      pole transformer). The inspector from YESB Township O ce will make a site
      visit only at this stage (and this is a di erent team from the meter
      installation team in Procedure 4).

      The inspector will then produce a report to YESB Township O ce and submit
      it to the YESB District O ce for approval to discharge the transformer (i.e.
      connectivity), which then submits to the YESB Head O ce for approval. Upon
      the YESB Head O ce’s approval, the District O ce will issue a connection
      permit to the customer and commission to discharge the transformer. Five
      engineers must be present at the time of discharging: from the YESB District
      O ce, YESB Head O ce Testing and Supporting Unit, Test Lab, Distribution,
      and YESB Township O ce.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                        several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the         - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                     and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                         economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                        - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                        - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                      equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)              - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                        commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                        - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                 - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                  - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                        movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding           foreclosure      The most likely applicable proceeding for the Mirage's case would be a foreclosure by judicial
                                      sale. After Mirage's default, BizBank would initiate the foreclosure by filing an application with
                                      the Western District Court in Yangon. Foreclosure involves the sale of the property by the
                                      lender.

Outcome              piecemeal sale   The hotel will stop operating and Mirage's assets will be sold by the court appointed bailiffs
                                      in a public auction.

Time (in years)      5.0              The foreclosure procedure until BizBank is repaid some or all of the money owed to it will
                                      take approximate 5 years. Usually after 1 year since Mirage's default, BizBank would initiate
                                      foreclosure by filing the petition at the Court. During the above mentioned 1-year period,
                                      BizBank needs to obtain formal documentary evidence indicating the endeavors made but
                                      failed to solve the payment issue. After receiving the application, it takes at least half a year
                                      for the Court to review the case, notify Mirage, hold hearings until the final order to receive
                                      the case is made. Within the following 1.5 to 2.5 years, the Court would make a final decision
                                      on BizBank's claim after rounds of legal debates. Then it takes another year for the Court to
                                      pass a degree and execution order based on which BizBank will be entitled to open an
                                      execution proceeding. In addition, the court needs to decide on all the third party claims,
                                      including tax authorities, which usually be settled within 1 year. After announcing the
                                      execution of the foreclosure proceeding, the Court will appoint a bailiff/judicial receiver to
                                      gather information on Mirage's assets, prepare them for sale and conduct the sale of
                                      Mirage's assets in a public auction. It takes approximate 1 year to complete the sale and
                                      distribute proceeds.

Cost (% of           18.0             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 18% of the value of the
estate)                               debtor's estate. The cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly includes
                                      attorneys' fees (10%), auctioneer's fees (2%), fees of accountants and other professionals
                                      (4%), and court fees (2%).

    Labor Market Regulation
Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
