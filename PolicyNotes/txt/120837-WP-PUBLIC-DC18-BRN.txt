About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Professional engineer (PE)

      Since June 2016, the electricity utility (DES) no longer reviews the single line
      diagram. It is instead submitted and reviewed ahead of the application by a
      professional engineer (PE) that is licensed with the Ministry of Development.
      The PE is a separate entity than the electrical contractor (i.e. quali ed
      person) that submits the new connection request and carries-out the
      connection works.

  2   Submit new connection application and permit to dig application                      7 calendar days        BND 0
      Agency : Authority for Building and Construction Industry (ABCi)

      The client needs to hire a quali ed person (chartered electrical engineer)
      that is registered and licensed with the Ministry of Development. This person
      will prepare the drawings and calculations.

      The quali ed person (QP) must then submit the external electrical layout
      (both internal and external). For underground connections crossing public
      roads, a permit to dig is also required - and it can be requested as part of the
      application for connection at the o ce of ABCi. All forms are available on the
      website of DES. The application can be lodged online but hard copy
      documents also need to be submitted for endorsement at the o ce of ABCi.

      From there, ABCi will take care of the excavation permit, and coordinate with
      DES for the technical study for the connection. Once the site survey is
      carried-out, ABCi will then issue a letter stating the connection fee to be paid
      during the nal procedure (BND 1,650). The letter also allows the contractor
      to purchase a meter from DES approved vendors.

  3   Obtain site survey                                                                   1 calendar day         BND 0
      Agency : Department of Electrical Services

      Once an application is submitted to ABCi, they will schedule a site survey. In
      the majority of cases the client (or his contractor) will be physically present
      during the site visit. The external site inspection is needed to (i) con rm the
      location of the tapping supply, (ii) make sure the network does not need to
      be extended, and (iii) carry-out the technical study of the connection works.

      contractor
      Agency : Approved electrical contractor

      The external works is completed by the approved electrical contractor (QP)
      and this consists mainly of laying underground cables from the warehouse
      to the closest point of supply on the LV network. In addition, the contractor
      will need to purchase a meter and install it. Finally, the contractor will need
      to test the internal wiring if he has both QP and PE certi cations. Otherwise a
      separate Electrical Professional Engineer (PE) will need to come on site to
      carry the nal inspection. For capacities larger than 215 kVA (300 Amp) a
      substation will also be needed.

  5   Obtain approval for permanent supply and electricity turn-on                         7 calendar days        BND 1,650
      Agency : Department of Electrical Services

      Once the internal wiring has been completed - and the meter is installed -
      carry the nal inspection. For capacities larger than 215 kVA (300 Amp) a
       Businesswill
Doing substation 2018also be needed.

    5   Obtain approval for permanent supply and electricity turn-on                     7 calendar days        BND 1,650
        Agency : Department of Electrical Services

        Once the internal wiring has been completed - and the meter is installed -
        the contractor must submits an application for electricity turn-on to the
        Customer Services Section of the Department of Electrical Services (DES)
        together with a test certi cation report veri ed by an Authorized
        Professional Engineer (PE) and an occupation permit. Submission can be
        done online via OneBiz, and the payment can be made online or by cash at
        the Business Support Centre. DES will then process to check the documents,
        after which the permanent supply will be given.

      search can be done online, purchasing a ticket to search for a limited
      amount of time. Most of the records since 2005 are available. If the search
      would involve a case prior to that, the lawyer would have to request this
      information physically at the court. Before you had to ll in a form and
      provide a name plus an identi er. Now you can search this information

       "His Majesty in Council" which is a council of o cials representing the Sultan.
       The petition to transfers follows a three-step process. First, the Lands
       Department will check that all the information has been lled in
       appropriately, and will check the technicalities of the transactions, issuing a
       report to the Ministry of Development. The Ministry would then review this
       information and would review whether the transaction is in line with the land
       policies of the government, submitting a report to His Majesty in Council if
       the transaction can proceed.
       Upon approval of the MOT, the Land o ce will assess the market value of the
       property and inform the applicant of the amount to be paid as stamp duty,
       the registration fee and land tax must be paid. The proof of payment must
       be provided to the Land O ce.
       The procedure to register an ownership transfer and a lease interest is the
       same. However, the time to obtain the approval of His Majesty in Council
       di ers. On average, the approval of a lease interests takes between 8 to 12
       months (however, in some cases it can take up to 24 months). Property
       transfers between local citizens take between 6 to 8 months to receive an
       approval.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                     Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating
                                                         charge or any charge that gives BizBank a security interest over ABC’s

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
                                                                                                                             Page 46

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
