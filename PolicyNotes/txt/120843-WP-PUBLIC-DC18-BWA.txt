About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of starting a business is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for

      Prior to 2011, all developers were required to undergo a Preliminary
      Environmental Impact Assessment (PEIA). However, after the adoption of the
      Environmental Assessment Act of 2011 and Environmental Assessment
      Regulations of 2012, BuildCo must only submit a project brief. Based on the
      project brief, the Department can screen a project and decide whether the
      project should (1) be allowed to proceed without being subjected to a
      detailed Environmental Impact Assessment, (2) require a detailed
      Environmental Impact Assessment Study prior to project implementation, or
      (3) develop an Environmental Management Plan prior to project
      implementation.

      Agency : Water Utilities Corporation

      Before construction starts, the City Council must approve the sewage
      connection. The investor must visit the Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) in
      person. When the investor comes to WUC, the investor is given forms to ll
      out, which is done on the spot. The investor must also bring detailed plans,
      showing where the connection will be made. The representatives of WUC
      examine the plans and lled out forms, and approve the plans on the spot. If
      the plans are not in order, then the approval is denied and the investor must
      return when the plans are in compliance with regulations.

      Agency : Water Utilities Corporation

      After the investor applies for a sewage connection, a representative from the
      Water Utilities Corporation comes out to inspect the building site to verify
      that the building plans approved in the application procedure correspond to
      the actual construction site. The inspection occurs after the sewage
      connection application has been approved.

       City Council
       Agency : Gaborone City Council

       Gaborone City Council approval is required to obtain a planning and building
       permit. The council examines the drawings and pays a site visit to ensure
       compliance with regulations and restrictions on health, sewer, re, building,
       and planning. For any construction over 1,000 sq. m., the City Council
       forwards the led documents for the approval of the Department of Town
       and Regional Planning (DTRP). Thus, BuildCo never enters into direct contact
       with the department.

       A certi ed copy of the title deed is also required. There are no restrictions on
       how recent the copy of the deed should be. It is assumed the BuildCo already
       owns the land that it intends to build on.


       A permit is valid for 24 months from the date of issue. If work has not started
       within that period, the permit will no longer be valid. However, if a written
       application for an extension is submitted, the validity of the permit can be
       extended for another 12 months.

       Council
       Agency : Gaborone City Council

       Once construction works have begun, a written notice no less than three
       working days (excluding Saturday, Sunday or Public Holiday) in advance
       should be given for every mandatory inspection. This inspection is
       conducted after the completion of every stage of construction. Below is the
       list of every stage:

       • Before the covering of an excavation for a foundation;
       • Before the covering of the foundation;
       • Before the covering of a damp-proof course;
       • Laying concrete or other material over a site; and
       • Before a drain or sewer to which these Regulations apply is covered in any
       way


       It is not advisable to perform construction without inspections; builders run
       the risk of being ordered to demolish a defective structure.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding           liquidation       Secured creditors in Botswana are likely to first attempt to recover their money through a
                     (after an         formal legal process of debt enforcement. However, the desire of the founder and

                                       the process for judicial management is an extraordinary procedure. Currently there has not

Outcome              going concern     Creditors in Botswana are very interested in keeping the value of the assets as high as
                                       possible, so they will do everything to make sure the hotel keeps operating until it can be
                                       sold as a going concern. This is the most efficient outcome for all concerned because if the
                                       business keeps operating then no value is lost. In addition, the recovery rate for creditors is
                                       likely to be higher where the business is eventually sold as a going concern.

Time (in years)      1.7               BizBank is most likely to initiate foreclosure. Other creditors will be disadvantaged by the
                                       Bank's foreclosure proceedings, so they are likely to initiate liquidation in order to stay all
                                       enforcement actions. During liquidation proceedings, all legal proceedings against Mirage
                                       will be suspended. The court will accept the petition and appoint a temporary trustee.
                                       Temporary trustee must prepare a list of the debtor's inventory and valuation thereof and
                                       submit it to the Master. An appraiser may be used for this purpose. The trustee will send a
                                       letter to all known creditors (based on the debtor's books) informing them of the
                                       proceedings. Creditors must submit their claims to the trustee, who will forward them to the
                                       Master's office, where they must be filed at least 24 hours before the first creditors' meeting.
                                       Claims must be proved at the creditors' meeting, where creditors can protest each other's
                                       claims. Creditors whose claims are not accepted may petition the High Court to review the
                                       validity of the rejection. A permanent trustee will be appointed at the first creditors' meeting.
                                       The trustee must prepare a report on the affairs and condition of the estate and present it
                                       at the second creditors' meeting. The creditors must give directions to the trustee on how to
                                       proceed with administration and sale of the assets. After the second meeting of the
                                       creditors, the trustee can proceed with the sale of the assets as approved by the creditors.
                                       Assets should be sold by public tender or public auction. Proceeds are distributed in
                                       accordance with statutory priority - costs of maintaining and realizing the assets and
                                       remuneration of the trustee are satisfied first, claims of secured creditors are paid next.

Cost (% of           18.0              Major expenses include remuneration of the insolvency representative (around 10% of the
estate)                                value of the estate), fees of the auctioneer (around 5% of the value of the estate), attorneys'
                                       fees (3% of the value of the estate), and fees of accountants and assessors (around 1% of the
                                       value of the estate).
