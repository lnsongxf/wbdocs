                           ACTION PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION
                                       PREFACE


In August, 2017, the Global Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Task Force released a report with a set
of specific recommendations to strengthen the World Bank’s capacity to identify, prevent and
mitigate against risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as other forms of GBV, in its
operations. The Bank has committed to the implementation of these recommendations, and to
taking the necessary measures to help prevent and respond appropriately to incidences of sexual
exploitation and abuse, as well as other forms of GBV in Bank-supported projects. Task Force
recommendations, as organized across five key stakeholder groups, reflect priorities linked to
enhancing social risk management, strengthening operational systems to enhance
accountability, and making the World Bank a responsible change agent by fostering a shift in
culture, behavior and perceptions. The recommendations also highlight the need to create
pathways for change beyond the Bank through industry and multilateral partnerships.
With the establishment of the Task Force, President Kim also called for the development of an
Action Plan to implement the recommendations. Fundamental to the Action Plan is the
continuing emphasis and focus on the guiding principles of the Task Force, including ensuring all
actions are ultimately people centered and enable the safety, dignity and agency of those affected
by World Bank-supported operations. Maintaining focus on recommendations to ensure the
safety and security of women, children and other vulnerable groups, and ensuring regular and
dynamic engagement with community partners will be integrated into respective actions
outlined in this Plan.
This Action Plan is derived from a review of every recommendation presented in the Task Force
Report, and of these priorities. The Action Plan consolidates and groups the recommendations
across key institutional areas which reference the above outlined priorities of the Task Force
Report. The primary actions are:
   ➢ Develop a methodology for assessing the risk of SEA/GBV: Fundamental to Task Force
     recommendations to enhance social risk management is the need for clear delineation
     of what constitutes “High Risk” of SEA/GBV to guide Task Teams, as related to the existing
     contextual factors, institutional capacity and the distinct, project-related risks that may
     exacerbate or create new risks. The Action plan highlights the need for definition and
     understanding of SEA/GBV risks and development of associated methodology, while also
     noting the need to develop of a roster of technical specialists who can support risk
     assessment work.

   ➢ Develop guidance and training materials to build staff/client capacity to address risks
     of SEA/GBV: The Task Force report identifies a range of critical actions to be undertaken
     throughout the project cycle, including among others identifying and supporting


                                                                        3
   appropriate expertise to educate and consult with women and children, developing
   differentiated approaches for assessing risks to boys and girls as compared with risks
   confronting women and other vulnerable groups, identifying key community partners,
   and also mapping the range of potential SEA/GBV service providers in a given context.
   Enabling realization of these recommendations ultimately relies on building the technical
   skills, knowledge and understanding of Task Teams to work with clients to identify key
   risks and address them in project design, implementation and monitoring. Building staff
   capacity and knowledge—particularly in country offices—to undertake and implement
   these requirements through training and guidance materials is a therefore a key priority.

➢ Develop an internal Reporting and Response Protocol to guide Bank staff in case of
  incidence: The emphasis of Task Force recommendations is to advance measures that
  promote prevention of incidence of SEA/GBV. In the event that SEA/GBV does occur,
  however, Bank staff and management require clear guidelines as to when, how and to
  whom to report, on the reporting chain of escalation and on how to respond in a
  confidential, survivor-centered and ethically sensitive way. This action will develop an
  internal reporting and response protocol to guide Bank staff, building on the sample
  reporting protocol provided in the Task Force Report (Annex 6).

➢ Strengthen operational processes to address SEA/GBV: The Task Force Report highlights
  a range of operational actions to be implemented in the event that a project is deemed
  as one with “High Risk” of SEA/GBV and seeks to leverage legal agreements to enhance
  accountability. This includes mandating Codes of Conduct for civil works contractors in
  Bank Standard Procurement Documents, with prohibitions against SEA/GBV, including
  prohibitions against sexual activity with anyone under the age of 18. Many of these
  provisions, particularly those related to procurement requirements, are already being
  implemented by the Bank. The Action Plan includes corresponding provisions to
  strengthen Bank operational processes, including procurement requirements,
  consultation considerations and recommendations for grievance redress mechanisms,
  Supervisory Engineers and Third Party Monitors.

➢ Develop internal and external outreach campaigns: Responding to Task Force
  recommendations to make the Bank a responsible change agent necessitates building an
  enabling environment to shift internal culture, perception and behavior of the need to
  address SEA/GBV in Bank-supported projects, the Action Plan highlights key actions to
  foster and maintain institutional rigor and engagement on the issue. Key actions also
  connect to efforts to create pathways for change beyond the Bank, working with client
  partners to assure their leadership and accountability in addressing risks of SEA/GBV, and
  identifying external outreach and partnership opportunities with industry actors and
  other multilateral development partners to expand attention and focus on these issues.




                                                                   4
➢ Ensure budget is available for TF recommendations: Realization of Task Force
  recommendations will require adequate resources to address transition costs and to
  develop needed training, guidance and communications materials to build internal and
  external capacity. The Action Plan re-emphasizes the need to make budget a driver for
  change through dedicated one-time surge funds to cover training and knowledge
  development costs, and through the establishment of a two-year GBV Prevention and
  Mitigation Fund to allocate additional resources to projects at High Risk of SEA/GBV to
  cover additional budget requirements.

➢ Ensure continuous learning to improve capacity to address SEA/GBV: Implementation
  of Task Force recommendations presents an important learning opportunity to expand
  the institution’s understanding of effective approaches to prevent or respond to
  SEA/GBV. Key actions underscore the need for continuous learning and include provisions
  for systematic portfolio reviews over the next three years, as well as a request for IEG
  review at the end of four years.

        4
          A key consideration for staff training and capacity building will be ensuring outreach and engagement in particular with
          country-level Bank staff. Additionally, training and guidance materials must highlight different approaches to identifying
          and responding to SEA/GBV risks affecting children, as well as respective approaches for supporting women and other
          vulnerable groups.

          To be linked to professional development objectives incentivizing engagement of high-performing staff. Interim
          training opportunities external to the Bank may be identified to enable more immediate capacity building of key

        implementation.
        10
           The Task Force report suggests including, among others: i) Contractors must demonstrate capacity to manage SEA risks;
         ii) contractors must develop plans for SEA/GBV sensitization and awareness training; iii) contractors should have sexual
         harassment policies governing conduct in the workplace; iv) development of contractor reporting and redress protocols
         in case of incidence; and v) prevention and response action plans and key staff with appropriate technical skill. Many of
         these actions have already been undertaken by Procurement but such provisions should ensure explicit focus on
         addressing risks linked to SEA/GBV. Additionally, there should be particular emphasis on building awareness of staff in
         country offices.
