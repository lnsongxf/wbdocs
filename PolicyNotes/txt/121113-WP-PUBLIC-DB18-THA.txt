About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : Bangkok Metropolitan Authority

      Before the plan approval, the municipal authority inspects the site to
      con rm that the drawings submitted accurately represent the project on
      site. The building control o cers of the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority
      process this approval.

  3   Obtain a building permit from the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority                30 days   no charge
      Agency : Bangkok Metropolitan Authority

      As of April 1, 2013 the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) now
      allows district directors to act on behalf of the Bangkok Governor under
      Building Control Act B.E. 2522 (1979) for simple buildings. The district
      director can issue the building approval for buildings that are not more than
      10,000 sq. m. and not taller than 23 meters. This fast-track option has
      signi cantly reduced the time to obtain the building permit.

      construction works
      Agency : Bangkok Metropolitan Authority

      After the building permit has been granted, the name of the construction
      supervisor must be given to the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority with the
      permission of that supervisor. The latter could be any quali ed person,
      including the building owner, unless that person is prohibited by the
      regulations of the Engineering or Architectural Profession Act.

      It is assumed that one of BuildCo’s employees or owners satis es the
      requirements for being a construction supervisor. It is common for the
      supervisor to be the owner or one of the employees of the construction
      company. The construction supervisor should verify building conditions
      periodically.


      BuildCo must also submit a noti cation to commence construction works.

      BMA will inspect the site about once per month to check for any violations
      during the construction phase. If there are complaints from others around
      the construction site, there will be more frequent inspections.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       proceed with the registration of the transfer of ownership. An o cial sales                 Business Tax)
       agreement is prepared and signed by the authorized representatives of the
       seller and buyer. The o cer then records the sales transaction at the back of
       the original land title deeds (both the land owner's and the Land O ce's
       copies).


       The Land O cer calculates all the registration fees and expenses and asks
       the parties to pay and submit to him the receipts. The registration fee is 2%
       of the appraised value calculated by the Bureau of Property Valuation (GAV)
       and announced by the Treasury Department, Ministry of Financed every 4
       years (Government Appraised Value (GAV)).


       The seller has to pay a 1% withholding tax on sale price or GAV - whichever is
       higher. (Seller may apply this as a credit towards their corporate income tax
       on any capital gain). As the seller is a company, withholding tax is calculated
       on the greater of the appraised value and the sale price.


       The seller has to pay stamp duty, which is 0.5% of the appraisal value if
       holding period for the individual is more than 5 years. If not, the transfer will
       be subject to the Speci c Business Tax (SBT). This SBT implies that the Seller
       has to pay 3.3% of the appraisal value or the sales price, whichever is higher.
       The 3.3% SBT includes a 0.3% municipality tax.

       The SBT is imposed on persons who sell their property for trade or a pro t-
       seeking purpose. Companies who sell real property in Thailand are deemed
       to be selling for trade or pro t and are subject to speci c business tax. Even
       if a company sells property in order simply to move to a new place, it is still
       deemed to have sold for a trade or pro t seeking purpose.

       Accordingly, the company who is the seller in this example will be subject to
       SBT. The registration fee, withholding tax and SBT are collected by the Land
       O ce. The cheques for the taxes are payable to the Ministry of Finance but
       collected by the Land O ce.

       The Land O cer then attaches the receipts to the application, and submits
       all documents to the Chief in charge who is authorized to approve the
       registration of the transfer. Once the registration is approved, it is deemed
       completed. The seller will receive one copy of the registered sale agreement.
       The buyer will receive another copy of the registered sale agreement and the
       original Land Title Deed.


       The Seller will need to produce the construction permit and household
       registration of the building as evidence to transfer the building.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                       receiver overseeing the entire process. Pursuant to Section 90/17, the Court would appoint
                                       the person who is nominated by Mirage as the plan preparer if suitable, which could take
                                       approximate 3 months. Creditors may file an application for repayment of debts for business
                                       reorganization within one month after the order of appointment of the plan preparer is
                                       published under Section 90/26. As specified in Section 90/43, within 3 months after the
                                       appointment, the plan preparer is required to submit the reorganization plan to the official
                                       receiver and creditors. In practice it will take around 1 years to prepare the creditor list, draft
                                       and vote the plan taking consideration of all possible objections and corresponding
                                       amendments to the plan. After the reorganization plan is approved by creditors and verified
                                       by the court, the implementation of the plan may take additional 6 months or more until
                                       BizBank is repaid some or all of the money owed to it.
