About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      Malta has a fast-track Development Noti cation Order (DNO) system for
      building permits but it is only applicable to the construction, re-
      development, alteration or extension of an industrial unit within Malta
      Industrial Parks and Malta Enterprise Zones which is state-owned land and
      cannot be privately owned. Therefore, this procedure would not be
      applicable to the Doing Business case study warehouse.

      An engineer's report dealing with re safety and ventilation is required. A
      mechanical and electrical engineer is engaged to prepare this report which
      may be submitted to Planning Authority after the screening letter is issued.

      Upon completion of construction, the engineer must submit a statement to
      Planning Authority at the end of construction stating that the building has
      been built according to the proper re safety standards.

      several aspects:
      - What additional information, if any, is needed for the application besides
      that already submitted in Procedure 1
      - Which entities Planning Authority will consult with – for a warehouse,
      Planning Authority will typically consult with the Civil Protection Department,

       Agency : Planning Authority

       Once the full application is submitted, Planning Authority publishes a notice
       in the local newspaper and on its website, informs the relevant local council
       and neighbors of the site, and a xes a notice on the site. This is done so
       that the public is informed that an application has been received, and the
       public may comment within 21 days from publication in the newspaper.
       Persons doing so will be recognised as interested parties during the
       processing of the application.

       The DPAR includes the Case O cer's assessment of the application, and
       concludes with his/her recommendation as to whether the application
       should be approved or not. If the recommendation is favorable, a draft
       building permit with conditions is attached to the DPAR. The DPAR also
       speci es the bank guarantees that may be required to obtain the permit,
       such as for the protection of the surrounding road surface, archaeological
       or environmentall sentive site, etc.


       The DPAR notice gives the date for the hearing in front of the EPC
       (Environmental Planning Commission) which cannot be held later than 90
       days after the submission of the application but is usually held 30 days after.


       There are two EPCs (Environment Planning Commission) - one deals with
       projects in Urban Conservation Areas and Outside Development Zone, while
       the other deals with projects which are in scheme. (For large projects, the
       application is reviewed by the main MEPA Board). The EPC reviews the
       application in a public hearing, which is attended by the applicant and the
       Architect and Civil Engineer responsible for the application. The EPC may
       request changes to the project, and the applicant is given an additional 4
       weeks in which to submit such changes for nal determination by the EPC. If
       no changes are requested, the physical permit is issued on the spot. The
                                                                                                                Page 15

   8   Hire an agency specialized in safety                                               1 day     EUR 1,500
       Agency : Private consultant

       A specialized agency in health and safety is generally hired to be in charge of
       safety issues to ensure that everything is done according to regulations on
       the construction site. The reason for this is that the legal responsibility lies
       with the owner and the contractor in case of an accident. The state will
       initiate a lawsuit against both if there is some form of accident or complaint.

of tari index.

If the duration and frequency of outages is not available, or is over 100, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.

If the minimum outage time considered for SAIDI/SAIFI is over 5 minutes, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.




    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      in a registration area). If the property is in a registration area, the

      or not. If registered, the Land Registry noti es the Notary and
      issues a Certi cate of Title with details on whom the property is
      registered and other details ancillary thereto (such as for e.g.
      contract details, if property is freehold or not etc..) The Land

      from the date the request was submitted.

                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Time (in years)     3.0                 Bank's foreclosure attempt and Mirage's subsequent reorganization attempt will take
                                        approximately 1 year. BizBank will try to enforce its executive title. Mirage's management will
                                        file for insolvency in order to prevent foreclosure. The court will hold its first hearing, where
                                        a receiver will be appointed. The court will grant a 6 months moratorium while the receiver
                                        analyzes the financials of the company. This period can be extended, during which time
                                        Mirage could propose a reorganization plan. BizBank will reject the plan and the proceedings
                                        will be converted into liquidation. After proceedings are converted into liquidation, it will take
                                        approximately 24 months to complete the process. The court will issue a decision on
                                        liquidation of the company and a liquidator will be appointed. The liquidator will hold a
                                        creditors' meeting, after which creditors will submit their claims. The liquidator will analyze
                                        the company's financials and will make a decision on acceptance of creditors' claims. This
                                        decision is likely to be disputed by creditors and appealed. After all the claims are finalized,
                                        the court will appoint an auctioneer, who will review the assets and prepare them for sale.
                                        The sale process may take up to 6 months.

Cost (% of          10.0                The cost of the procedure will amount to approximately 10%. The main expenses will include
estate)                                 attorneys' fees - 4%, remuneration of the insolvency representative - 2%, fees of other
                                        professionals involved in the case, such as accountants and assessors - 2%, and court fees -
                                        2%.
