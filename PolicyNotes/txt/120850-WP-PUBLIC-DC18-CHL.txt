About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Registration is a sole procedure to be complied with for all tax purposes in
        order to obtain a Chilean Tax ID (RUT number). Specially regarding those
        persons (individual or legal entities) that are going to develop activities in
        Chile, taxpayers must obtain a RUT number and perform "initiation of
        activities" ("Inicio de Actividades") before the Chilean IRS, which is a sworn
        statement submitted to inform that the taxpayer will start to develop
        economical activities in Chile. Both procedures can be carried out through
        the Chilean IRS website (www.sii.cl).

        referred tax authority. According Law 20.727, starting November, 2014, most
        of the VAT tax documentation shall be issued electronically (invoices, debit
        and credit notes, among others).

        Agency : Internal Revenue Service

        Invoice and receipt forms can be sealed only after the tax registration
        number (rol unico tributario, or RUT) has been obtained, because the RUT
        must appear on them. This procedure is generally carried out once the
        forms are duly printed.
                                                                                                                              Page 8

        number (rol unico tributario, or RUT) has been obtained, because the RUT
        must appear on them. This procedure is generally carried out once the

        When using electronic invoices, companies are not required to seal
        accounting books, invoices and other documents at the IRS. Therefore, once
        electronic invoices are enacted in law and in practice, this procedure will be

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      Once BuildCo obtained the clearance from the Sanitary Company (utilities) ,
      BuildCo may now request a risk classi cation from the sanitary authority.
      The General Urbanism and Construction Ordinance of Chile (“Ordenanza
      General de Urbanismo y Construcciones) under Article 4.14.2 sets
      parameters for qualifying industrial or warehousing facilities into 4
      categories: Dangerous, Unhealthy / Pollutant, Irritating or Harmless. Based
      on this Ordinance, warehousing or industrial establishments shall be
      assessed on a case by case basis by the respective Regional Sanitary
      Authority (“Secretaría Regional Ministerial (Seremi) de Salud”), taking into
      account the risks that the building may cause to their workers,
      neighborhood and community.


      A warehouse such as the one in the Doing Business case study would likely
      be rated "Harmless" because it is used for storage of non-hazardous items
      such as books.

       Agency : Municipality

       In parallel with the interaction with the utility company, BuildCo, can request
       the possibility to have some services while the construction takes place. To
       obtain a provisional permit for installation of temporary facilities, BuildCo’s
       architects must meet the Municipality’s architects to review the drawings
       and designs. This permit enables BuildCo to have bathrooms, electricity, and
       so forth on the construction site.

   7   Request and obtain building permit                                                 68 days   CLP 2,236,551
       Agency : Municipality

       BuildCo must obtain a municipal building permit before construction starts.
       An external reviewer is also involved in this process.


       In 2005, a number of municipalities introduced a pilot program for a one-
       stop shop (la Ventanilla Transaccional de Trámites Municipales, VTM), an
       Internet platform where nine proceedings can be completed. The project
       was expected to be in full operation in 26 municipalities by 2006. The system
       is expected to cut processing time to 8 days. On January 12, 2006, the
       Municipality of Santiago introduced major changes to its regulatory plan
       (plano regulador) to regulate some omissions from the construction
       ordinance (ordenanza de construcción), without changing the current rules
       of construction.


       Some municipalities -- for example, Las Condes, Providencia, San Miguel, and
       Ñuñoa -- have restricted construction in terms of density and building
       height. The same restrictions were expected in Santiago in 2007. The latter is
       due to community pressures, reduced municipal revenues for this type of
       building permit, and the impact of the projects on public services and
       infrastructure.


       Other municipalities in the greater Santiago area are planning the opposite
       to attract investments, such as La Florida, San Bernardo, Maipú, and Quinta
       Normal. Environmental requirements are requested to obtain building
       permits, which in turn, can a ect the schedule of a construction project. The
       plot for the case study warehouse would most likely be located in Los Andes,
       which has not been a ected by either change.

       The cost of the building permit is 1.5% of the construction cost. The
       construction cost is calculated according to a fee schedule. The fee schedule
       is not based on a simple classi cation of buildings. There are two elements
       to consider: 1) classi cation based on material and structure used and 2)
       classi cation based on the amount of positive attributes that the building
       has.


       Regarding classi cation based on material, one can classify the building
       based on 9 di erent categories (A-I) depending on the materials (steel,
       concrete, wood, etc.) and structures used. Regarding the classi cation based
       on positive attributes, one can classify the building into 5 di erent
       categories based on the number points the building would obtain following
       the provided technical guide (design, structure, installations, and nishing of
       the building).

       The 5 di erent categories are: Category 1 – Superior (20 or more points);
       Category 2 - Medium superior (13-19 points); Category 3 - Medium (6-12
                                                                                                                    Page 14

       The Doing Business warehouse would fall into classi cation A and obtains 3
       points. Thus, the warehouse falls into classi cation "A4" (A because it is steel
       and 4 because it receives 3 points). Therefore, the cost per square meter is

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
                                                                                                                        Page 45

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the          - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                      and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)               - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                         commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                         - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                  - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                 - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                   - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                         movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding         liquidation          Mirage would attempt a reorganization proceeding, which is going to involve in-court
                   (after an            negotiations with creditors of different classes, including secured creditors. It is likely that an
                   attempt at           agreement is not reached, so that the reorganization proceeding will be converted into a
                   reorganization)      liquidation proceeding. At this stage creditors may choose to carry out a simplified judicial
                                        liquidation proceeding or an ordinary judicial liquidation which could include the sale of
                                        movable and immovable property.

Outcome            piecemeal sale       Once the liquidation proceeding starts, the trustee will be in charge of administration of the
                                        debtor’s assets. The trustee will sell Mirage’s assets separately and distribute the proceeds
                                        of the sale among the creditors based on the priorities established.

Time (in years)    2.0                  The Reorganization procedure is relatively fast, since in a few months (3 to 5) the
                                        reorganization agreement is approved or rejected and, generally, before the debtor fails to
                                        do so, it is passed to the liquidation stage. In comparison, the liquidation procedure takes
                                        longer than the reorganization process, since the ordinary credit verification period is longer
                                        (30 business days), after which a period of recognition and objection of verified credits is
                                        established, several Boards of Creditors And subsequently the sale of the property (6 to 18
                                        months). Finally, it must be taken into account that the processing time will vary from court
                                        to court, as the workload between them is not uniform.

Cost (% of         14.5                 The costs associated with the reorganization proceeding which is then converted into
estate)                                 liquidation, like in the case of Mirage, would amount to approximately 14.5% of the value of
                                        the Mirage’s estate, according to the following breakdown: - Attorney’s fees: attorneys could
                                        charge a maximum of 8% (according to the fee schedule of the Bar of Valparaiso). - Fees of
                                        insolvency administrators: 6% is a fixed rate (article 34 of the Commercial Code). However, in
                                        practice the trustees could obtain around 10% of the value of the debtor’s estate. - Costs of
                                        notification: The Official Journal has a fixed cost that could be around 0.5% including the
                                        additional costs related to publication.
