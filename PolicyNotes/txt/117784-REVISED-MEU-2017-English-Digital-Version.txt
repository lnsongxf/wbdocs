The World Bank’s biannual Mozambique Economic Update
(MEU) series is designed to present timely and concise
assessments of current economic trends in Mozambique in
light of the country’s broader development challenges. Each
edition includes a section on recent economic developments
and a discussion of Mozambique’s economic outlook, followed
by a focus section analyzing issues of particular importance.
The focus section for this edition addresses the impact of the
economic downturn on Mozambique’s private sector. The
MEU series seeks both to inform discussions within the World
Bank and to contribute to a robust debate among government
officials, the country’s international development partners, and
civil society regarding Mozambique’s economic performance and
key macroeconomic policy challenges.

The cutoff date for the current edition of the MEU was June
30, 2017.

The Mozambican economy
is showing some signs of                             A positive outlook for growth

After a difficult 2016 which saw a sharp slowdown
in growth and shocks to both the currency and
inflation, early trends in 2017 show signs of
improvement. First quarter GDP growth in 2017
picked up to 2.9 percent, more than double the
growth rate of the preceding quarter. The metical,
which had been steadily depreciating against the
dollar in the first ten months of 2016 is now more
stable after having strengthened by 28 percent
against the US dollar over the last 9 months. A

Mozambique’s fiscal position continues to be
unsustainable and the overall fiscal adjustment
has been limited. Without progress in the debt
restructuring process to date, the country’s debt
position remains untenable. Subsidy reforms,
a difficult area to tackle, have advanced and
will contribute to easing fiscal pressures. But

                                     Box 1: Extractives FDI and job spillovers

    What happens to foreign direct investment when a developing country makes an
    unpredictable giant oil or natural gas discovery? A recent analysis of developing and
    emerging economies from 2003 to 2014 found that FDI booms related to natural resources
    lead to a bonanza of other diversified FDI projects in manufacturing, services, construction
    and other sectors.

    Mozambique’s FDI inflows have boomed since 2010 and in 2012 Mozambique received 15
    percent of all sub-Saharan African FDI (while it accounts for a little less than 1 percent of
    SSA GDP). In 2013-2015 FDI amounted to 70 percent of Mozambique’s GDP, the highest
    share of all African countries. A recent study by Toews and Vézina notes that over 100
    greenfield non-extraction project announcements were recorded from 2009 to 2014, 45 of
    which in Maputo. These projects are expected to have a cumulative worth of around USD
    21 billion and to create 25,500 jobs, mostly in construction, manufacturing and services.
    The study suggests that these inflows were stimulated by Mozambique’s natural resource
    discoveries. Using the weighted average of jobs created through FDI in countries with no
    natural resource discoveries as a control, the authors find that this represents a 50-fold
    increase in jobs created due to FDI (Figure 3).

    The authors also matched information on individual jobs to FDI projects across cities, sectors
    and years, and estimated the impact of these FDI projects on jobs by city and sector. The
    results indicate that one additional FDI project in a particular city and sector, e.g. a new
    British bank in Beira or a new South African supermarket in Tete, created at least 434 jobs
    on average. Additionally, the authors found that the average wage in a particular city in a
    particular sector increased by 0.8 percent with each extra FDI project.

20 Amount includes arears on EMATAUM, MAM and Proindicus loans, as well as fuel supply arrears from June 2016 onwards. Arrears
to private creditors include principal and interest payments. Interest payments arrears (roughly 2 percent of GDP) contribute to
widening the fiscal deficit.
21 Supplier arrears are not routinely reported in official fiscal reports.
22 Mozambique’s fiscal accounts are presented on a cash basis. Traditionally, several governments recorded their government
accounts on a cash basis only, however, the IMF’s Government Finance Statistic Manual (GFSM) proposes that governments should
also record accrual accounts to get an indication of the full spectrum of governments fiscal position. In the latter, commitments
such as government debt servicing or employee pension obligations would be included in the fiscal accounts.

37 The firm landscape in many developing countries tends to be marked by a “missing middle”, a dearth of small and medium size
firms, as firms choose to stay informal or very small to avoid excessive government regulation. This phenomenon is problematic
for economic growth as it has been shown to be associated with weak overall productivity growth as informal and very small
firms tend to lack access to resources like capital and skilled labor (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008).
38 Three quarters of firms in Mozambique employ fewer than five employees.
39 Concentration is measured by dividing the sector’s share of total value added by its share of total firms. For example, electricity
and gas contribute 2.3 percent to total value added but since this is generate by only 0.4 percent of total firms, it is a sector with
a high concentration of value added .

47 A draft Secured Transactions law has been prepared and is in the final stages of approval. The implementation of this law will
be an important achievement for Mozambique and will help expand the range of collateral available to borrowers.
48 As of the latest Doing Business Report, the public credit registry at the Central Bank contains information for only 5 percent
of the country’s population and there are limitations to what type of data is collected for this 5 percent. A private credit bureau
does not exist. In addition, the legal framework for the collateralization of movable assets is very limited. Both factors resulted in
a score of only 25 out of 100 points on the distance to frontier measure of the “Getting Credit Indicator” in the latest publication.
49 As of the latest Doing Business report, Mozambique scores only 43 out of 100 points on the distance to the frontier measure
for “Protecting Minority Investors”, the indicator capturing the quality of a country’s corporate governance regime.

51 Economies with a more efficient judiciary, in which courts can effectively enforce contractual obligations, have been found to
have more developed credit markets and a higher level of development overall. See, for example, Mehnaz Safavian and Siddharth
Sharma (2007).
52 Nunn (2007) found that countries with weak contract enforcement are less likely to export goods that require relationship-
specific investments. According to his estimates, contract enforcement explains more of the patterns of trade than physical
capital and skilled labor combined.
53 See, for example, Esposito et al. (2014).
54 According to Doing Business, the time to start a business was reduced from 174 to 19 days and the number of procedures
reduced from 15 to 10 between 2006 and 2016. However, other countries reformed more aggressively at the same time, which
explains why Mozambique still ranks relatively low on this indicator.

55 Competition policy is generally seen as the fourth pillar for government’s economic policy, along with monetary, fiscal and
trade policies. Competition policy is defined as the policy specifically directed to prevent anticompetitive business practices by
firms and unnecessary government intervention in the marketplace and is usually carried out by a competition agency as defined
by a competition law. (UNTAD (2011)).
56 The Competition law is Law 10/2013 of 11 April 2013. Further steps towards the implementation of the competition law in
Mozambique were taken with the publication of the Statute of the Authority and of the Competition Law Regulation on 1 August
and 31 December 2014, respectively.

58 According to Doing Business, the total statutory tax rate for Mozambican firms is low compared to other countries in the region
and even compared to rich countries, but Mozambican firms deal with more than twice as many payments as their peers in richer
countries, tax audits are frequent and a VAT refunds take a long time.
