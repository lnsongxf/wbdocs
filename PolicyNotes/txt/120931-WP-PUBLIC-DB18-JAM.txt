About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      The inspector conducts the internal wiring inspection based on the Jamaican
      21 standard. If the customer premises structure of internal wiring used is
      accepted, the record of the inspection and results is recorded and the
      relevant information based on size, type and location of customer premises
      is sent to JPS. In cases where the internal wiring is not accepted, the
      customer is informed and has to restart the process.

      where service is required, when service is required, load details of major
      equipment, to be used in new/expanded facility - rating in kilovolt amperes
      (kVA) or ampere (A) units. Also where applicable, the applicant should state
      details of load balancing for a 3 phase supply ( a single line drawing and

      to be met to supply the customer with electricity. Requirements include
      number of poles, transformers, length of conductor among other items that
      will be needed. A drawing is prepared of the site layout, to outline to the
      Easement team, any situations that may require legal action or reference                                                             Page 21

       and the reasoning behind such action; as well as the Construction Team, to
       facilitate the successful execution of the development process. The ndings
       from the site visit will be entered into an application that has prede ned
       measurements based on the regular, current and projected factors that
       facilitate the successful completion of any particular job. The result will
       determine the nal estimate. This cost is communicated to the customer.
       [This particular case is not considered as such to warrant the inclusion of
       easement costs in total estimate, but in a many cases, a provision is made
       for such costs when an electrical equipment other than a service wire may
       need to be placed on a customer's or connecting customer's premises to
       successfully execute the construction process].
       In short, the process is as below:
       1. Engineering team conducts site inspection and determines site layout and
       other requirements to meet customer's supply needs.
       2. A drawing of the site layout is prepared and easement requirements
       noted, where necessary.
       3. Estimate re ecting the costs for material and labour is prepared.
       4. This cost is communicated to the customer.

       1. Once the customer pays the construction estimate, JPS carries out the
       necessary construction works and external connections.
       2. JPS invites the GEI to inspect and certify works completed.
       3. It is at this stage that GEI certi cation for the customer facility is also
       required. Such certi cation is normally submitted directly to JPS from the
       GEI's O ce.
       4. Upon con rmation of GEI certi cation for both the customer's facility and
       JPS works carried out, the customer is asked to pay the security deposit and
       provide any other outstanding documentation to complete the supply
       contract.
       5. Customer signs contract, meter is installed and electricity starts owing.

      and folio numbers; the lot number and deposit plan number (if any); the
      physical address and name stated on the property title. The surveyor also

       functionaries including the Justice of the Peace and Attorney of Law and
       Notary Public. The Notary Public charges a fee but the Justice of Peace does
       not charge a fee. A notary will charge around 50 USD for this operation. If a
       lawyer is involved in the entire process, he can act as a witness.

       Payments of Stamp Duty and Transfer Tax may be paid using Cash/Certi ed
       Manager’s Cheque/Debit or Credit Card/Letter of Undertaking or Bank
       Guarantee. Once all payments are made, the Transfer Instrument is
       prepared and witnessed, in accordance to Article 152 of the Registration of
       Title Act. This Transfer Instrument is then sent for cross-stamping at the
       Stamp O ce. The stamped Agreement for Sale (AFS) needs to be attached as
       a proof of payment to the instrument of transfer. Cross stamping is
       important as the Registrar of Titles will not accept the Transfer Instrument
       unless it is cross stamped. For all document that must be stamped, a TRN
       number must be provided.
       A Transfer Tax Certi cate is obtained which must be submitted to the
       Registrar of Titles.

                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
