Disease Control Priorities: Improving Health and Reducing Poverty
DISEASE CONTROL PRIORITIES
Budgets constrain choices. Policy analysis helps decision makers achieve the greatest value
from limited available resources. In 1993, the World Bank published Disease Control Priorities
in Developing Countries (DCP1), an attempt to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness
(value for money) of interventions that would address the major sources of disease burden
in low- and middle-income countries. The World Bank’s 1993 World Development Report
on health drew heavily on DCP1’s findings to conclude that specific interventions against
noncommunicable diseases were cost-effective, even in environments in which substantial
burdens of infection and undernutrition persisted.
    DCP2, published in 2006, updated and extended DCP1 in several aspects, including
explicit consideration of the implications for health systems of expanded intervention
coverage. One way that health systems expand intervention coverage is through selected
platforms that deliver interventions that require similar logistics but deliver interventions
from different packages of conceptually related interventions, for example, against car-
diovascular disease. Platforms often provide a more natural unit for investment than do
individual interventions. Analysis of the costs of packages and platforms—and of the health
improvements they can generate in given epidemiological environments—can help to guide
health system investments and development.
    DCP3 differs importantly from DCP1 and DCP2 by extending and consolidating the con-
cepts of platforms and packages and by offering explicit consideration of the financial risk
protection objective of health systems. In populations lacking access to health insurance
or prepaid care, medical expenses that are high relative to income can be impoverishing.
Where incomes are low, seemingly inexpensive medical procedures can have catastrophic
financial effects. DCP3 offers an approach to explicitly include financial protection as well
as the distribution across income groups of financial and health outcomes resulting from
policies (for example, public finance) to increase intervention uptake. The task in all of the
DCP volumes has been to combine the available science about interventions implemented
in very specific locales and under very specific conditions with informed judgment to reach
reasonable conclusions about the impact of intervention mixes in diverse environments.
DCP3 ’s broad aim is to delineate essential intervention packages and their related delivery
platforms to assist decision makers in allocating often tightly constrained budgets so that
health system objectives are maximally achieved.
    DCP3 ’s nine volumes are being published in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 in an environment
in which serious discussion continues about quantifying the sustainable development goal
(SDG) for health. DCP3 ’s analyses are well-placed to assist in choosing the means to attain
the health SDG and assessing the related costs. Only when these volumes, and the analytic
efforts on which they are based, are completed will we be able to explore SDG-related and
other broad policy conclusions and generalizations. The final DCP3 volume will report those
conclusions. Each individual volume will provide valuable, specific policy analyses on the full
range of interventions, packages, and policies relevant to its health topic.
    More than 500 individuals and multiple institutions have contributed to DCP3. We
convey our acknowledgments elsewhere in this volume. Here we express our particular
gratitude to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for its sustained financial support, to
the InterAcademy Medical Panel (and its U.S. affiliate, the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Sciences), and to World Bank Publications. Each played a critical role
in this effort.

within each region. The trend for “experiencing” the risk is inverse to the trend for “imposing the risk.” The latter is based on parsing the total estimated global burden from climate
change according to each region’s contribution to emissions of carbon dioxide and methane over time—its natural debt.

individual-level medical services (for example, deworming, growth monitoring) are covered in other DCP3 volumes and are not addressed here. Interventions in this table include those that have
been shown to be cost-effective or cost-beneﬁcial in low- and middle-income countries or for which such cost-effectiveness or cost-beneﬁt can be logically concluded from high-income or other
data. For water and sanitation, many of the policy-level interventions mentioned do not have such evidence; however, the individual items promoted by these policies (for example, ﬁlters, piped
water, boreholes, private latrines) do have a strong evidence base. Unlike interventions with only health beneﬁts, however, many if not most interventions in environmental health bring a range of
other beneﬁts lying outside the health sector, for example, time savings, property values, IQ enhancement, and so on. Cost-effectiveness measured solely in health terms, therefore, can be
misleading with regard to total social beneﬁt-cost relationships.

     Note: Hypothetical scenario is the disease burden that would occur if age-speciﬁc rates for these conditions in high-income countries applied in low- and middle-income countries.
     Avertable burden is the difference between current and hypothetical scenarios. Three levels of signiﬁcance are kept to reduce rounding errors, but true uncertainty is possibly
     higher. Even so, totals may not add due to rounding.

           The Environmental Health Pathway

           This chapter relies loosely on the classic environmen-    deposition and exfiltration of pollutants through
           tal health pathway for describing and understanding       openings. Concentrations are not necessarily equiv-
           pollution risks (figure B7.1.1), which starts with        alent to exposures; for example, a monitor that
           sources and emissions of pollution, moves to envi-        measures pollution in a kitchen (defined here as the
           ronmental levels, then to human exposures, then to        built environment around the cooking area, whether
           doses within the body, and finally to health impacts      indoors or outdoors) for 24 hours does not reflect a

Table 8.1 Examples of Climate-Informed Health Interventions
 Climate-related health risks and
 mechanisms                           Examples of interventions
 Extreme heat and thermal stress      • Establish occupational health exposure standards.
                                      • Improve health facility design, energy-efficient cooling and heating systems.
                                      • Ensure public education to promote behavior change (in relation to clothing and ventilation).
                                      • Develop heat-health action plans (including early warning, public communication, and response
                                        plans) such as cooling centers for high-risk populations.
 Water- and food-borne diseases       • Enhance disease surveillance systems during high-risk seasons or periods.
                                      • Establish early warning systems to anticipate outbreaks associated with extreme weather and
                                        climate events.
                                      • Strengthen food and water quality control.
 Zoonotic and vector-borne diseases   • Expand the scope of diseases monitored and conduct monitoring at the margins of current
                                        geographic distributions.
                                      • Establish early warning systems when data are sufficient and the association between
                                        environmental variables and health outcomes is robust.
                                      • Establish vector or pest surveillance and control programs.
                                      • Enhance diagnostic and treatment options in high-risk regions or periods.
                                      • Ensure adequate animal and human vaccination coverage.
 Allergic diseases and                • Develop exposure forecasts for air quality, allergens, and dust.
 cardiopulmonary health               • Enforce stricter air quality standards for pollution.
                                      • Establish programs to monitor pollen levels.
                                      • Establish allergen management.
                                      • Create plans for handling increased demand for treatment during high-risk seasons or weather
                                        conditions.
 Nutrition                            • Perform seasonal nutritional screening in high-risk communities.
                                      • Scale up integrated food security, nutrition, and health programming in fragile zones.
                                      • Promote public education and food hygiene.
 Storms and floods                    • Include climate risks in siting, designing, or retrofitting health infrastructure.
                                      • Establish early warning and early action systems, including education and community mobilization.
                                      • Assess and retrofit or construct public health infrastructure (health facilities in flood-prone areas)
                                        to be resilient to extreme weather conditions, warmer temperatures, and environmental changes.
 Mental health and disability         • Address special needs of mental health patients (as well as patients with other disabilities) by
                                        developing emergency preparedness plans.
                                      • Address mental health needs of disaster- and trauma-exposed populations.
                                      • During extreme weather conditions, establish community watch for people with mental illness.

      America and the Caribbean, East Asia and Paciﬁc, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. These studies estimated the costs of poor sanitation, including health and nonhealth impacts (access
      time, costs of accessing safe water, tourism). The Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP) of the World Bank conducted studies on the costs of environmental
      degradation in eight Mediterranean countries from 1999 to 2002. Country environmental analyses conducted by the World Bank in more than 20 countries since 2003 have estimated the health
      costs of poor water and sanitation.

Intervention Efficiency: Cost-Benefit Analysis                                  and best-available evidence from multiple sources
The discussion of efficiency should distinguish between                         (Hutton 2013; Whittington and others 2009)

a. For LPG scenarios, one-time costs are the LPG connection costs. Current prices are available at IndianOil Corporation, https://indane.co.in/connection_tarrifs.php;
US$1.00 = 68.13 rupees (Rs). For biomass stoves, one-time costs represent the cost of implementation.
b. For LPG scenarios, yearly costs are the cost of the fuel subsidy to the government and the cost of the fuel to the households. The analysis assumes that houses use nine cylinders
per year at an unsubsidized cost of US$8.80 (Rs 600.00) per cylinder; that Haryana has 3.35 million homes; and that the per cylinder subsidy is approximately US$3.70 (Rs 250.00).
For biomass stoves, yearly costs are stove maintenance costs borne by the household.
c. India’s national oil companies cover connection costs for 60 percent of households; connection costs to the household apply only for the upper three quintiles.
d. The subsidy provided to existing LPG users is redirected to the lower-income quintiles.

      Note: DALYs = disability-adjusted life years; LPG = liqueﬁed petroleum gas; Q = quintile. Shaded areas account for uncertainty in background disease conditions and indicate the minimum and
      maximum avoidable burden. The relatively constant shape of the lines for each scenario is a byproduct of high solid fuel use across all income quintiles (range 60 percent to 90 percent) and
      the increasing number of people per household with increasing income, despite an approximately equal number of homes in each quintile.

Note: DALYs = disability-adjusted life years; GIU = Give It Up; LPG = liqueﬁed petroleum gas; Q = quintile; SFU = solid fuel use. Fuel cost to households includes the up-front, one-time stove
costs and recurrent maintenance and fuel costs. Household expenditures averted are the sum of the hourly wages accrued and the medical costs averted minus the cost to the households. For
the LPG-GIU pathway, subsidy retargeting has different implications for solid fuel users versus current LPG users. Solid fuel users assume the additional full cost of unsubsidized LPG, while
current LPG users assume only the difference between the full, unsubsidized LPG cost and the subsidized cost.

                Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. In
support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and print-
on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together,
these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased,
resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions,
and waste.
    We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled con-
tent. The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using
totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), or enhanced elemen-
tal chlorine–free (EECF) processes.
